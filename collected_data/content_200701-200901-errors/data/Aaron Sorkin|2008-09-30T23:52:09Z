'''Aaron Benjamin Sorkin''' (born June 9, 1961) is an American [[screenwriter]], [[television producer|producer]] and playwright.  After graduating from [[Syracuse University]] with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in [[Musical Theatre]] in 1983, Sorkin spent much of the 1980s in New York as a struggling, largely unemployed actor.<ref name =syracuse-interview>"[http://sumagazine.syr.edu/summer01/features/spotlight/index.html In the Spotlight: Script Sensation]", Brad Herzog, ''Syracuse University Magazine'', Summer 2001. Retrieved on May 9, 2007.</ref> He found his passion in writing plays, and quickly established himself as a young promising playwright. His stageplay ''[[A Few Good Men]]'' caught the attention of Hollywood producer [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]], who bought the film rights before the play even premiered.<ref name=MovieMoguls/>

[[Castle Rock Entertainment]] hired Sorkin to adapt ''A Few Good Men'' for the big screen. The movie, directed by [[Rob Reiner]], became a box office success. Sorkin spent the early 1990s writing two other screenplays at Castle Rock for the films ''[[Malice (film)|Malice]]'' and ''[[The American President (film)|The American President]]''. In the mid-1990s he worked as a [[script doctor]] on films such as ''[[Schindler's List]]'' and ''[[Bulworth]]''. In 1998 his television career began when he created the TV comedy series ''[[Sports Night]]'' for the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network. ''Sports Night'''s second season was its last, and in 1999 overlapped with the debut of Sorkin's next TV series, the multiple-[[Emmy Award|Emmy]]-award-winning political drama ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'', this time for the [[NBC]] network. He left ''The West Wing'' at the end of its fourth season in 2003, after which it continued three more seasons without him. He returned to television in 2006 with a [[dramedy]] called ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'', about the backstage drama at a late night sketch comedy show, once again for the NBC network. While Sorkin's return was met with high expectations and a lot of early online buzz before '' Studio 60's'' premiere,  NBC did not renew it after its first season in which it suffered from low ratings and mixed reception in the press and on the Internet. His most recent feature film screenplay is ''[[Charlie Wilson's War]]''.

After more than a decade away from the theatre, Sorkin returned to adapt for the stage his screenplay ''[[The Farnsworth Invention]]'', which started a workshop run at [[La Jolla Playhouse]] in February 2007 and which opened on [[Broadway Theatre|Broadway]] in December 2007.<ref name=Back-to-Broadway/> He has battled with a cocaine addiction for many years, but after a highly publicized arrest he received treatment in a drug diversion program and rid himself of the drug dependence. In television, Sorkin is known as a controlling writer, who rarely shares the job of penning the [[Screenplay#Television|teleplays]] with other writers. His writing staff are more likely to do research and come up with stories for him to tell. His trademark is writing rapid-fire dialogue and extended [[Monologue|monologues]], and in television, this penchant is complemented by frequent collaborator [[Thomas Schlamme]]'s characteristic visual technique called the "[[Walk and talk|Walk and Talk]]".

==Early years==
Sorkin was born in the [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]] to [[Jew]]ish parents, and raised in the wealthy suburb of [[Scarsdale, New York]].<ref name=SeattlePI/><ref name=USWeekly-Jones>{{cite news |title=A Troubled Genius |author=Oliver Jones |date=[[2001-05-28]] |work=[[US Weekly]] |url=http://b4a.healthyinterest.net/news/000083.html |accessdate=2007-01-22}}</ref> His mother was a school teacher and his father a copyright lawyer; both his older sister and brother went on to become lawyers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sorkin to nest at WBTV: Big deal for ace scribe runs 4 years |author=Josef Adalian, Michael Schneider |date=2000-07-26 |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117784231.html |accessdate=2008-09-26 |quote=Sorkin's association with Warner Bros. follows in the footsteps of his father Bernard, a New York-based copyright expert who started with the studio 40 years ago when it was [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts|Warner Bros.-7 Arts]]. }}</ref><ref name=DeJonge-interview/> At an early age Sorkin took an interest in acting. Before he reached his teenage years, his parents regularly took him to the theatre to see shows such as ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' and ''[[That Championship Season]]''.<ref name=CharlieRose-2000>{{cite video | people = [[Charlie Rose]] (interviewer) | date = October 24, 2000 | title = [[Charlie Rose (talk show)|The Charlie Rose Show]]: A Conversation with Aaron Sorkin | url = http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2000/10/24/2/a-conversation-with-aaron-sorkin | format = Flash | medium = Television production | accessdate = 2007-05-09}}</ref> At that age, Sorkin did not always comprehend the plot of the plays; nevertheless he enjoyed the sound of the dialogue.<ref name=TheAge-Forrest>{{cite news |title=Words fly down the halls of power |author=Emma Forrest |date=[[2002-05-02]] |work=[[The Age]] |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/05/02/1019441403137.html |accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref>

Sorkin attended [[Scarsdale High School]] where he became involved in his high school drama and theatre club. In eighth grade he played General Bullmoose in the musical ''[[Li'l Abner (musical)|Li'l Abner]]''.<ref name=syracuse-interview/>

In 1979 Sorkin attended [[Syracuse University]]. In his [[Student#Years|freshman year]] he failed a class that was a core requirement. It was a devastating setback because he wanted to be an actor, and the Drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed all the core freshman classes. He returned in his sophomore year determined to do better, and graduated in 1983 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Musical Theatre.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Creation of the Future: The Role of the American University |author=Frank Harold Trevor Rhodes |year=2001 |month=October |publisher=Cornell University Press |pages=p.75–76 |isbn=978-0801439377 }}</ref>

===Unemployed actor, promising playwright===

After graduation, Sorkin moved to New York City where he worked odd jobs ranging from delivering [[singing telegram]]s,<ref name=syracuse-interview/> driving a limousine, touring Alabama with the children’s theatre company Traveling Playhouse,<ref name=DeJonge-interview>{{cite news |title=Aaron Sorkin Works His Way Through the Crisis |author=Peter De Jonge |date=[[2001-10-28]] |work=The New York Times |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01EFD81F3EF93BA15753C1A9679C8B63 |accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> handing out fliers promoting a hunting-and-fishing show,<ref name=syracuse-interview/> to bartending on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at theatres such as the [[Palace Theatre, New York|Palace Theatre]].<ref>{{cite web |title=PLAYBILL ON-LINE'S BRIEF ENCOUNTER with Peter Krause |author=Ernio Hernandez |url=http://www.playbill.com/celebritybuzz/article/87365.html |work=[[Playbill]] |accessdate=2007-06-07}}</ref> One weekend, while house sitting at a friend's place he found an [[IBM Selectric typewriter]], started typing, and "felt a phenomenal confidence and a kind of joy that [he] had never experienced before in [his] life."<ref name=DeJonge-interview/>

He continued writing and eventually put together his first play ''Removing All Doubt'' which he sent to his old theatre teacher, Arthur Storch, who was impressed.  In 1984, ''Removing All Doubt'' was staged for drama students at his alma mater, Syracuse University. After that, he wrote ''[[Hidden in this Picture]]'' which debuted [[Off-Off-Broadway|off-off-Broadway]] at Steve Olsen's West Bank Cafe Downstairs Theatre Bar in [[New York City]] in 1988.  The contents of his first two plays got him a [[Talent agent#Writer's Agents|theatrical agent]].<ref name=Weiss-seminar>{{cite web |title=Three days, 15 seminars, one great experience |author=Valerie Weiss, PhD |year=2003 |month=December |publisher=ImagineNews.com |url=http://www.imaginenews.com/Archive/2003/DEC_2003/01_FEATURES/12_THREE_DAYS.html |accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref>  Producer John A. McQuiggan saw the production of ''Hidden in this Picture'' and commissioned Sorkin to turn the one-act into a full-length play called ''Making Movies''.<ref name=NYT-review3/>  His reputation as a playwright was quickly gaining stature on the New York theatre scene.

===''A Few Good Men''===
[[Image:A Few Good Men at Haymarket Theatre London.jpg|right|thumb|220px|''A Few Good Men'' at London's [[Haymarket Theatre|Theatre Royal Haymarket]] on August 31, 2005.]]
Sorkin got the inspiration to write his next play, a courtroom drama called ''[[A Few Good Men]]'', from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah, who had graduated from [[Boston University School of Law|Boston University Law School]] and signed up for a 3-year stint with the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Navy|Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps]].  She was going to [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]] to defend a group of [[Marine corps|Marines]] who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a [[hazing]] ordered by a superior officer.  Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre on Broadway.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Few Good Men London theatre tickets and information |publisher=ThisIsTheatre.com |url=http://www.thisistheatre.com/londonshows/afewgoodmen.html |accessdate=2007-01-22}}</ref> He and his roommates had purchased a [[Macintosh 512K]] so when he returned home he would empty his pockets of the cocktail napkins and type them into the computer, forming a basis from which he wrote many drafts for ''A Few Good Men''.<ref name=CharlieRose-2003/>

In 1988 Sorkin sold the film rights for his play ''A Few Good Men'' to producer [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]] before it even premiered, for a deal possibly worth a sum well into six-figures.<ref>{{cite news |title=Marine Life |date=[[1989-11-27]] |author=William A.

It starred [[Tom Hulce]] and was directed by [[Don Scardino]]. After opening in late 1989, it ran for 497 performances.<ref>{{cite news |title=Aaron Sorkin Working on A Few Good Men for London and New Play for Dublin's Abbey |author=Ernio Hernandez |date=[[2004-06-18]] |work=Playbill |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/86900.html |accessdate=2007-01-20}}</ref>

Sorkin continued writing ''Making Movies'' and in 1990 it debuted [[off-Broadway]] at the Promenade Theatre, produced by John A. McQuiggan and directed by Don Scardino.<ref name=NYT-review3/>  Meanwhile, David Brown was producing a few projects at [[TriStar Pictures]] and tried to interest them in making ''A Few Good Men'' into a film but his proposal was declined due to the lack of star actor involvement.  Brown later got a call from Alan Horn at [[Castle Rock Entertainment]] who was anxious to make the film.  [[Rob Reiner]], a producing partner at Castle Rock, opted to direct it.<ref name=MovieMoguls>{{cite book |title=Movie Moguls Speak: Interviews with Top Film Producers |last=Prigge |first=Steven |year=2004 |month=October |publisher=McFarland & Company |pages=p.12–13 |isbn=978-0786419296}}</ref>

==Screenwriting career==
===Working under contract for Castle Rock Entertainment===
In the early 1990s, Sorkin worked under contract for [[Castle Rock Entertainment|Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc.]]<ref name=Reiner>{{cite news |title= Rob Reiner's March To 'A Few Good Men' |author=Bernard Weinraub |date=1992-12-06 |work=The New York Times |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6D71738F935A35751C1A964958260 |accessdate=2007-09-26}}</ref> He wrote the scripts for ''A Few Good Men'', ''Malice'', and ''The American President'': the three films grossed about $400 million worldwide.<ref name=SeattlePI/> While writing for Castle Rock he became friends with colleagues such as [[William Goldman]] and [[Rob Reiner]] and met his future wife, Julia Bingham, who was one of Castle Rock's business-affairs lawyers.<ref name=Prayer>{{cite news |title=On a Wing and a Prayer |author=Patrick Goldstein |date=1999-10-10 |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/10/entertainment/ca-20753 |accessdate=2008-09-26 }}</ref>

Sorkin wrote several drafts of the script for ''[[A Few Good Men]]'' in his New York apartment,<ref name=Reiner/> learning the craft of screenwriting from a book about [[Screenwriting#Example of proper formatting|screenplay format]].<ref name=Weiss-seminar/> He then spent several months at the Los Angeles offices of Castle Rock, working on the script with Rob Reiner.<ref name=Reiner/> William Goldman (who regularly worked under contract at Castle Rock) became his mentor and helped him to adapt his stageplay into a [[screenplay]].<ref>{{cite interview |last=Sorkin |first=Aaron |interviewer=[[Katie Couric]] |program=[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]] |callsign=[[NBC]] |city=New York |date=[[2002-05-22]]|url=http://b4a.healthyinterest.net/news/000124.html}}</ref> Goldman also approached Sorkin with a story premise, which Sorkin developed into the script for ''[[Malice (film)|Malice]]''. Goldman oversaw the project as [[creative consultant]] while Sorkin wrote the first two drafts of ''Malice''. However, Sorkin had to leave the project to finish up the script for ''A Few Good Men'', which was then directed by Rob Reiner, starring Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore, and Kevin Bacon, and was produced by David Brown. ''A Few Good Men'' was a box office success.

In the meantime, screenwriter [[Scott Frank]] had been hired to write two drafts of the ''Malice'' screenplay, but when production on ''A Few Good Men'' wrapped up, Sorkin took over and continued working on the script for ''Malice'', through until the final [[shooting script]]. Harold Becker directed ''Malice'', a medical thriller, starring Nicole Kidman and Alec Baldwin. ''Malice'' had mixed reviews. Vincent Canby in ''The New York Times'' described the film as "deviously entertaining from its start through its finish", however, [[Roger Ebert]] panned it, and [[Peter Travers]] in a 2000 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' review summarized it as having "suspense but no staying power".<ref>{{cite news |title=An Idyll Shattered By Rape and Murder |author=Vincent Canby |date=1993-10-01 |work=The New York Times |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=2&res=9F0CEEDD103CF932A35753C1A965958260 |accessdate=2008-09-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=''Malice'' |author=[[Roger Ebert]] |date=1993-10-01 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19931001/REVIEWS/310010306/1023 |accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=''Malice'' |author=[[Peter Travers]] |date=2000-12-08 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5948919/review/5948920/malice |accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref>

Sorkin's last produced screenplay for Castle Rock was ''[[The American President (film)|The American President]]'' and once again he worked with William Goldman, who served as a creative consultant.<ref name=TheAge-Forrest/> It took Sorkin a few years to write the screenplay for ''The American President'', which started off as a massive 385-page screenplay; it was eventually whittled down to a standard shooting script of around 120 pages.<ref name=SeattlePI>{{cite news |title=Aaron Sorkin is a man of many words |author=John Levesque |date=[[2000-03-07]] |work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |url=http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/tv/sork07.shtml |accessdate=2007-01-10}}</ref> Rob Reiner directed. The film was critically acclaimed. Kenneth Turan in the ''Los Angeles Times'' described the film as "genial and entertaining if not notably inspired", and believed its most interesting aspects were the "pipe dreams about the American political system and where it could theoretically be headed".<ref>{{cite news |title=''The American President'': Boy Meets Girl, Brings Along Secret Service 'The American President' is a sentimental fantasy, mixing romance |author=Kenneth Turan |date=1995-11-17 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie960406-46,0,1355383.story |accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref>

Sorkin collaborated with [[Warren Beatty]] on a couple of scripts, one of which was ''[[Bulworth]]'', contributing a polish.<ref name=TheGross-Bart/> Beatty, known for occasionally personally financing his film projects through pre-production, also hired Sorkin to rewrite a script titled ''Ocean of Storms'' which never went into production; at one point Sorkin sued Beatty for proper compensation for his work on the ''Ocean of Storms'' script, however, he eventually continued working on the script once the matter was settled.<ref>[[Peter Biskind]].

Sorkin fought with the ABC network during the first season over the use of a [[laugh track]] and a [[live studio audience]].

In 2000 a fiasco ensued at an awards ceremony where Sorkin and [[Rick Cleveland]] were awarded an Emmy for writing ''The West Wing'' episode "[[In Excelsis Deo]]". Cleveland had informed Sorkin in an e-mail message that if they won he wanted to say a few words in honor of his father's memory.<ref>{{cite news |title='West Wing' Producer, a Union Leader, Rules Out Writers' Raises |author=Bernard Weinraub |date=[[2001-06-26]] |work=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/26/arts/26WEST.html |accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref> At the awards ceremony Cleveland was ushered off the stage by Sorkin and was not given a chance to make any remarks. The story was based on Cleveland's father, a Korean war veteran who spent the last years of his life on the street; Cleveland later laid out the circumstances surrounding the Award Ceremony flap in an essay he contributed to FreshYarn.com titled "I Was the Dumb Looking Guy with the Wire-Rimmed Glasses".<ref>{{cite web |title=I Was the Dumb Looking Guy with the Wire-Rimmed Glasses |author=Rick Cleveland |publisher=FreshYarn.com |url=http://www.freshyarn.com/10/essays/cleveland_iwas.htm |accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref> When ''The New York Times'' revealed the slight, Sorkin attacked Cleveland in a public web forum at [[Television Without Pity|Mighty Big TV]] saying that he gives his writers "Story By" credit on a rotating basis "by way of a gratuity" and that he had thrown out Cleveland's script and started from scratch. Cleveland responded on the web site in the same thread and a war of words briefly carried on.<ref>{{cite news |title=West Wing Web War! |author=Mickey Kaus |date=[[2001-07-03]] |publisher=Slate.com |url=http://www.slate.com/id/1007932/ |accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref>  Sorkin later apologized saying he was "dead wrong" and had "reacted too quickly to what [he] felt was an egregiously unfair characterization of the way writers are treated on The West Wing."<ref>{{cite web |title=In Excelsis Deo |publisher=The West Wing Episode Guide |url=http://www.westwingepguide.com/S1/Episodes/10_IED.html |accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref>

In 2001, after wrapping up the second season of ''The West Wing'', Sorkin had a drug relapse, only two months after receiving a Phoenix Rising Award for drug recovery; this became public knowledge when he was arrested at the [[Burbank Airport]] for possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms, marijuana, and crack cocaine.  He was ordered by a judge to a drug diversion program.<ref name=CreatorDiverted/>  His drug addiction was highly publicized, most notably when ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' did a parody called "The West Wing" (see [[#Personal life|Personal life]]).<ref name=SNL_sketch/>  Sorkin recovered and continued writing ''The West Wing'''s scripts with the same devotion.{{Fact}}

His TV series ''The West Wing'' has been called ''[[The West Wing (TV series)#The Left Wing|The Left Wing]]'' because of its alleged liberal bias.<ref name=HR-westwingfinale/>

In 2002, Sorkin assailed NBC news anchor [[Tom Brokaw|Tom Brokaw's]] TV special about a day in the life of a president, "The Bush White House: Inside the Real West Wing," comparing it to the act of sending a valentine to President George W. Bush instead of real news reporting.<ref>{{cite news |title=West Wing Watch: Snookered by Bush |date=[[2002-02-25]] |work=[[The New Yorker]] |url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/content/articles/020304ta_talk_friend?020304ta_talk_friend |accessdate=2007-01-14}}</ref>  Sorkin's TV series ''The West Wing'' aired on the same network, and so at the request of NBC's Entertainment President [[Jeff Zucker]] he apologized, but would later say "there should be a difference between what [[NBC News]] does and what ''The West Wing'' TV series does."{{Fact}}<ref>{{cite book |title=Hollywood's New Radicalism: War, Globalisation and the Movies from Reagan to George W.

===''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip''===
{{main|Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip}}
In 2003 Sorkin divulged to the American television interviewer [[Charlie Rose]] on ''[[Charlie Rose (talk show)|The Charlie Rose Show]]'' that he was developing a TV series based on a late night sketch comedy show like ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Inside Move: Sorkin scripting play, pic: Return to TV on hold |author=Scott Hettrick |date=[[2003-09-11]] |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117892324.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1 |accessdate=2007-01-14}}</ref><ref name=CharlieRose-2003/>  In early October 2005 a [[Television pilot|pilot]] script dubbed ''Studio 7 on the Sunset Strip'' written by Aaron Sorkin for a new TV series from him and producer Thomas Schlamme started circulating around Hollywood and generating interest on the web.  A week later, NBC bought from [[Warner Bros. Television|Warner Bros.

Sorkin described the show as having "autobiographical elements" to it and "characters that are based on actual people" but said that it departs from those beginnings to look at the backstage maneuverings at a late night [[sketch comedy]] show.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sorkin turns his attention to TV |author=Kevin Young |date=[[2006-08-27]] |work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5290474.stm |accessdate=2007-01-21}}</ref>

In September 2006, the pilot for ''Studio 60'' aired on NBC, directed by Thomas Schlamme. The pilot was critically acclaimed and had high [[Nielsen Ratings|ratings]], but ''Studio 60'' experienced a significant drop in audience by mid-season.{{Fact|date=September 2008}}  The seething anticipation that preceded the debut was followed up by a large amount of thoughtful and scrupulous criticism in the press, as well as largely negative and feverish analysis in the [[blogosphere]].{{Fact}}<ref>{{cite news |title=Sorkin takes the blame for `60’ |author=Patrick Goldstein |date=2007-07-17 |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/17/entertainment/et-goldstein17 |accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref>  In January 2007 Sorkin spoke out against the press for focusing too heavily on the ratings slide and for criticism that sources blogs and unemployed comedy writers.{{Fact|date=September 2008}}  After many months on hiatus, ''Studio 60'' resumed but only to air the last episodes of season one.  The show was officially canceled on May 14{{Fact|date=February 2008}}. The final air date in North America was June 28, 2007.{{Fact|date=September 2008}}

===Back to writing for film===
In 2003, Sorkin was writing the screenplay ''The Farnsworth Invention'' [[Screenplay#Writing on spec or assignment|on spec]], with the hopes of a later sale to a producer or studio.<ref>{{cite news |title=Inside 'The Alamo' |author=Army Archerd |date=[[2003-10-29]] |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117894813.html?categoryid=2&cs=1 |accessdate=2007-01-23}}</ref>  In 2004 it was announced that Thomas Schlamme would direct the completed screenplay about the story of [[Philo Farnsworth]] and that [[New Line Cinema]] was buying.  The story follows Farnsworth's battles with [[David Sarnoff]] for the patent for the invention of the television.<ref name=NewLine-press>{{cite press release |title=New Line Cinema acquires Aaron Sorkin's The Farnsworth Invention, taps Thomas Schlamme to direct |date=April 28, 2004 |publisher=[[New Line Cinema]] |url=http://www.newline.com/press/2004/0428_farnsworth.shtml |accessdate=2007-01-21}}</ref> However, the film never went into production.{{Fact}}

In 2004, after having just completed the screenplay for ''The Farnsworth Invention'' [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] made a seven-figure deal with Sorkin to adapt "60 Minutes" producer [[George Crile III|George Crile]]'s nonfiction book ''[[Charlie Wilson's War]]'' for [[Tom Hanks]]' production company [[Playtone]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Sorkin goes from White House to front line: Playtone partners Hanks, Goetzman to produce 'War' |author=Michael Fleming |date=[[2004-06-17]] |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117906666.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1 |accessdate=2007-01-23}}</ref>  ''Charlie Wilson's War'' is about the colorful Texas congressman [[Charles Wilson (politician)|Charlie Wilson]] who funded the CIA's secret war against the former Soviet Union in Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite news |title=Playtone goes to 'War' with U: Hanks to play former Texas congressman Wilson |author=Michael Fleming |date=[[2003-07-20]] |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117889616.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1 |accessdate=2007-01-23}}</ref>  Sorkin completed the screenplay and the film was released in 2007 starring Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, directed by Mike Nichols.{{Fact}}

On July 12, 2007, ''Variety'' reported that Sorkin had signed a deal with Dreamworks to write three scripts. The first script is titled ''The Trial of the Chicago 7'', which Sorkin has been developing with Steven Spielberg and producers [[Walter Parkes]] and [[Laurie MacDonald]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Sorkin on 'Trial' at DreamWorks: Duo to team on possible Spielberg project |author=Michael Fleming, Pamela McClintock |date=2007-07-12 |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117968411.html |accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref> In August, 2007, Sorkin announced that he had agreed to write a script about [[Facebook#Potential_future_film|how Facebook was invented]] for producer [[Scott Rudin]].{{Fact|date=September 2008}}

==Returning to the theatre==

In 2005, Sorkin revised his play ''[[A Few Good Men]]'' for a revival at London's [[Haymarket Theatre|Theatre Royal Haymarket]].  It had been over 15 years since he had originally written it.  The West End revival opened in the fall of the same year and was directed by [[David Esbjornson]], with [[Rob Lowe]] of ''The West Wing'' in the lead role.<ref>{{cite news |title=West End boys club: Lowe, Sorkin team for 'Good Men' revival |author=Michael Fleming |date=[[2005-04-24]] |work=Variety |accessdate=2007-01-10 |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117921624.html }}</ref>

Sorkin was contacted in 2003 by Jocelyn Clarke, the commissions manager of the [[Abbey Theatre]] in [[Dublin]], to write a script for The Abbey, a commission which he accepted. Sorkin wrote about the patent battle between inventor [[Philo Farnsworth]] and RCA employee [[David Sarnoff]] for the technology that allowed the first television transmissions, delivering a first draft in early 2005. The Abbey Theatre was set to stage a production of the play, and the [[La Jolla Playhouse]] in [[California]] quickly followed up with plans to stage a production of its own in conjunction with The Abbey. However, in 2006 The Abbey's new management pulled out of the joint effort.<ref>{{cite news |title='Farnsworth' fumble: Abbey drops ball on Sorkin commission |author=Karen Fricker |date=[[2006-02-05]] |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117937383.html |work=Variety |accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref> Yet the La Jolla Playhouse pushed on with [[Steven Spielberg]] lending his talents as producer and the production opened under La Jolla's signature [[La Jolla Playhouse#Page To Stage New Play Development Program|Page To Stage New Play Development Program]] which allows Sorkin and director Des McAnuff to develop the play from show to show according to audience reactions and feedback.<ref name=SpielbergFilms>{{cite web |title=Spielberg produces 'Farnsworth Invention' on stage |date=[[2006-09-17]] |publisher=SpielbergFilms.com |url=http://www.spielbergfilms.com/general/1076 |accessdate=2007-01-23}}</ref>  The play started its run at La Jolla Playhouse on February 20, 2007.<ref name=LaJolla>{{cite news|title=Sorkin and McAnuff Collaborate on LaJolla's 'Invention' |url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=14438 |publisher=BroadwayWorld.com |accessdate=2007-01-02}}</ref> ''[[Playbill]]'' reported in June 2007 that ''The Farnsworth Invention'' would open on in the fall of 2007.<ref name=Back-to-Broadway>{{cite web |title="Aaron Sorkin's Farnsworth Invention to Open on Broadway in  November"|date=[[2007-06-21]] |work=Playbill |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/109037.html|accessdate=2007-06-22}}</ref>  The play showed in [[preview]]s at the [[Music Box Theatre]] and was scheduled to open on November 14.<ref>{{cite news |title='Invention' sparks reinvention: Sorkin's former movie pitch hits Broadway |author=Gordon Cox |date=2007-11-10 |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR660001116.html |accessdate=2007-11-10}}</ref>  The opening was delayed by the [[2007 Broadway stagehand strike]], but opened at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on December 3, 2007 following the end of the strike.<ref>{{cite news |title=It's Over!

Sorkin has continued in his renewed capacity as a playwright, attaching himself to several projects.

Sorkin has a habit of [[chainsmoking]] while he spends countless hours cooped up in his office plotting out his next scripts.<ref name=USWeekly-Jones/>  He describes his writing process as physical because he will often stand up and speak the dialogue he is developing.<ref>{{cite news |title=Aaron Sorkin speaks about 'Studio 60,' the press and those pesky bloggers |author=Maureen Ryan |date=[[2007-01-19]] |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |url=http://tempo.typepad.com/entertainment_tv/2007/01/aaron_sorkin_sp.html |accessdate=2007-02-12 }}</ref>

Sorkin is known for writing memorable lines and fast-paced dialogue,<ref name=DeJonge-interview/> as well as extended [[monologues]] for prominent characters,{{Fact}} such as the "I am God" piece from ''[[Malice (film)|Malice]]'',{{Fact}} the "You can't handle the truth!" piece from ''[[A Few Good Men]]'',{{Fact}} and the partly Latin tirade against God in ''The West Wing'' episode "[[Two Cathedrals]]".<ref name=DeJonge-interview/> In television Sorkin's stylemark is the repartee that his characters engage in as they small talk and banter about whimsical events taking place within an episode, and interject obscure popular culture references into conversation.<ref>{{cite news |title=West Wing votes in new writers |date=[[2003-07-25]] |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3095619.stm |accessdate=2007-01-25 }}</ref>  His storytelling strengths lie in exploring the behind-the-scenes situations of workplace settings,{{Fact}} such as the JAG Corps., a sports show, the White House, and most recently, a sketch comedy show.

Although his scripts are lauded for being literate,<ref>{{cite news |title=Malice: A Film Review |author=James Berardinelli |year=1993 |publisher=Reelviews.net |url=http://www.reelviews.net/movies/m/malice.html |accessdate=2007-01-10}}</ref><ref name=syracuse-interview/><ref name=DeJonge-interview/> Sorkin has been criticized for often turning in scripts that are overwrought.<ref>{{cite news |title=‘Studio 60’ doesn't take comedy seriously: Show's flailing by focusing on issues, not craziness of the writers' room |author=Linda Holmes |date=[[2006-11-26]] |publisher=MSNBC.com |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15640559/ |accessdate=2007-01-25}}</ref> His mentor [[William Goldman]] has commented that normally in visual media speeches are avoided, but that Sorkin has a talent for dialogue and gets away with breaking this rule.<ref name=TheAge-Forrest/>  Others complain that his use of dialogue is excessive and is cover for weak story arcs in his scripts.{{Fact}}

In a ''New York Times'' article by Peter De Jonge it was explained that "''The West Wing'' is never plotted out for more than a few weeks ahead and has no major story lines", which De Jonge believed was because "with characters who have no flaws, it is impossible to give them significant arcs, and so as engaging as ''West Wing'' is minute to minute, it has no cumulative power".<ref name=DeJonge-interview/> Sorkin has also stated that in television he doesn't plan out a season, but not because he thinks planning is ineffectual but rather because of time constraints: "I seldom plan ahead, not because I don’t think it’s good to plan ahead, there just isn’t time."<ref name=WGA_East/> Sorkin, commenting on another aspect of his writing process in television, said, "As a writer, I don't like to answer questions until the very moment that I have to." The ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s TV critic John Levesque has commented that Sorkin's writing process "can make for ill-advised plot developments".<ref name=SeattlePI/>

In television he will have a hand in the writing of every episode, rarely letting other writers earn full credit on a script.<ref name=DeJonge-interview/> Peter De Jonge in his ''New York Times'' piece on Sorkin wrote that ex-writers of the show have claimed that "even by the spotlight-hogging standards of Hollywood, Sorkin has been exceptionally ungenerous in his sharing of writing credit".<ref name=DeJonge-interview/> Sorkin has also noted that because he writes every episode deadlines for scripts are never met.<ref name=CharlieRose-2003/> In a 2008 interview in ''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]'', Sorkin said, "I’m helped by a staff of people who have great ideas, but the scripts aren’t written by committee."<ref>{{cite news |title=Why Does Aaron Sorkin Feel So Guilty? |author=Mickey Rapkin |date=2008-08-12 |work=[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]] |url=http://men.style.com/gq/blogs/gqeditors/2008/08/why-does-aaron.html |accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref>

In early 1998, Aaron Sorkin began a collaboration with [[Thomas Schlamme]] when they found they shared common creative ground on the soon to be produced ''Sports Night''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with Thomas Schlamme, Director and Executive Producer, "Sports Night" |author=Elif Cercel |date=[[1999-11-11]] |work=[[Directors World]] |url=http://b4a.healthyinterest.net/news/archives/1999/11/interview_with.html |accessdate=2007-01-21}}</ref><ref name=CC-interview/>  Their successful partnership has endured for nearly a decade so far with Aaron Sorkin writing the scripts and Thomas Schlamme [[Executive producer#Television|exec producing]] and occasionally [[Television director|directing]].  They have developed a reputation for producing quality stories with mainstream appeal in a variety of media though they have only worked together in Television.<ref name=NewLine-press/>  They each contribute an equal amount of effort to the projects they've collaborated on: ''Sports Night'', ''The West Wing'', and ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip''.  Schlamme creates the look of the shows, works with the other directors who come in when he is not directing, discusses the scripts with Sorkin as soon as they are turned in, makes design and [[Casting (performing arts)|casting decisions]], and attends the [[Film budgeting|budget meetings]].  Sorkin tends to stick strictly to writing the scripts of which he writes almost all of them in their entirety with other writers frequently appearing in the "Story by" credit and occasionally the "Written by" credit.<ref name=CC-interview/>

One of Schlamme's trademarks is ''The West Wing''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s style of continuously tracking in front of characters as they walk side by side while talking at the same time, usually while on their way to a meeting or conference directly related to the substance of the discussion, a visual technique called the "[[Walk and talk|Walk and Talk]]".  Schlamme did not want to have scene cuts that relocated characters without any explanation of how they got there so he developed the "Walk and Talk" device to work with Sorkin's dialogue.<ref name=HR-westwingfinale/>
