The '''1995 Pacific hurricane season''' was the least active [[List of Pacific hurricane seasons|Pacific hurricane season]] since [[1979 Pacific hurricane season|1979]].<ref name="epachurdat">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2006|title=Hurricane Data for Pacific Hurricanes 1949 – 2005|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2006-11-20|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1949to2005_epa.txt}}</ref> Of the eleven tropical cyclones that formed during the season, four affected land, with the most notable storm of the season being [[Hurricane Ismael]], which killed at least 116&nbsp;people in [[Mexico]]. The strongest hurricane in the season was Hurricane Juliette, which reached peak winds of 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h).

The season officially started on [[May 15]], [[1995]] in the eastern Pacific, and on [[June 1]], [[1995]] in the central Pacific, and lasted until [[November 30]], [[1995]]. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern [[Pacific Ocean]]. The season saw eleven tropical cyclones form, of which ten became tropical storms. Seven storms attained hurricane status, of which three acquired [[Tropical cyclone#Major hurricane|major hurricane status]]. The number of tropical storms was much less than the average of 16 storms, while the number of hurricanes and major hurricanes were slightly below average.<ref name="pastprofile">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=1996|title=Average Cumulative Number of Systems Per Year|accessdate=2006-11-20|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gifs/pastprofileEP.gif}}</ref>

==Season summary==
[[Image:August 7, 1995 EPAC.JPG|right|thumb|220px|Tropical Depression Erick (left) and Tropical Storm Flossie (bottom-center) on [[August 7]]]]
The seasonal activity during 1995 was below normal, and marked the first of several seasons with lower than normal activity, a trend that would persist until the following decade.<ref name="epachurdat"/> Four tropical cyclones affected [[Mexico]]: first, Hurricane Flossie passed within 75&nbsp;[[mile]]s (120&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) of [[Baja California]], producing moderate winds and killing seven people. Afterwards, Tropical Storm Gil dropped heavy rainfall in southern Mexico early in its life, though caused no damage; Hurricane Henriette later made landfall near [[Cabo San Lucas]] with winds of 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h), resulting in moderate damage but no deaths. Finally, [[Hurricane Ismael|Ismael]] struck the state of [[Sinaloa]] as a minimal hurricane. Offshore, fishermen were caught off guard by the hurricane, causing 57 of them to drown. On land, Ismael destroyed thousands of houses, leaving 30,000 homeless and killing another 59. Both Hurricanes Flossie and Ismael also produced moisture and localized damage in southwestern [[United States]].<ref name="flossietcr"/><ref name="ismaeltcr"/>

Activity in the Central Pacific Ocean was below active as well. No tropical storms formed in the basin, the first time in four years.<ref name="epachurdat"/> Barbara was the only tropical cyclone to exist within the basin, but it formed in the Eastern Pacific. It entered as a weakening tropical storm, and quickly dissipated, without affecting land.<ref name="cphc">{{cite web|author=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|year=1995|title=The 1995 Central Pacific Tropical Cyclone Season|accessdate=2006-11-20|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/1995.php}}</ref> It was the least activity in the basin since 1979, when the basin was completely quiet, as no storms entered the basin that year.<ref name="epachurdat"/>

==Storms==
Eleven tropical cyclones, including one tropical depression that failed to attain tropical storm status, developed in the Eastern Pacific Ocean in 1995.

Located in an area of warm waters, Adolph exhibited a well-defined outflow pattern, and [[rapid deepening|rapidly strengthened]] to attain hurricane status on [[June 17]] as a banding-type [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] developed. Hurricane Adolph turned to the northwest and attained major hurricane status late that same day. The small eye of the hurricane continued to organize, as very deep convection surrounded the [[eyewall]], and Adolph reached its peak intensity of 135&nbsp;mph (215&nbsp;km/h) on [[June 18]], making it a Category 4 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Saffir-Simpson scale]]. Shortly thereafter, the storm weakened, as the upper-level environment became more hostile, and the system moved over progressively cooler waters. On [[June 19]], Adolph turned to the west, and degenerated back into a tropical storm later that day. On [[June 20]], the storm weakened to a tropical depression, and on [[June 21]], Adolph began to dissipate as its center became devoid of deep convection.<ref name="adolphtcr"/>

As Adolph moved north towards Mexico while about 290&nbsp;miles (465&nbsp;km) off the coast, the Mexican government issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warning]] and a hurricane watch from [[Punta Tejupan]] to [[Cabo Corrientes]]. When the storm turned to the northwest and later to the west, the government discontinued the warnings as it was determined the storm would not be a threat to land. No damage or casualties were reported.<ref name="adolphtcr"/>

Barbara continued westward under the influence of a [[subtropical ridge]] to its north, and began to steadily weaken on [[July 14]] as it moved into an area of cooler [[sea surface temperature|water temperatures]]. The hurricane degraded to a tropical storm on [[July 16]], and a day later it deteriorated to a tropical depression. As a depression with little to no convection near its center, Barbara continued west-northwestward until dissipating on [[July 18]] while located 720&nbsp;miles (1160&nbsp;km) east-southeast of [[Hilo, Hawai'i]].

A [[tropical wave]] moved off the coast of [[Africa]] on [[July 11]]. It moved westward and quickly developed two areas of convection along the wave axis. One of the areas nearly developed into a tropical depression after moving northwestward, though it failed to organize further and dissipated. The southern area continued westward and ultimately entered the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] on [[July 21]]. Thunderstorms along the wave axis became more concentrated a few hundred miles south of the [[Gulf of Tehuantepec]], and the system developed into Tropical Depression Five-E on [[July 24]] while located 500&nbsp;miles (800&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]], [[Mexico]].<ref name="dalilatcr">{{cite web|author=Edward N.

Located in an area of weak steering currents and easterly [[wind shear]], the tropical depression drifted to the north-northeast while the convection was displaced up to 70&nbsp;miles (110&nbsp;km) west of the circulation. Slightly strengthening occurred, and on [[July 25]] the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Dalila. The storm turned to the northwest, and later to the west-northwest, and remained a minimal tropical storm until [[July 28]] when a decrease in wind shear allowed Dalila to strengthen. A strong [[anticyclone]] developed to the north of the system, causing Dalila to accelerate to the northwest. Late on July 28, Dalila reached a peak intensity of 65&nbsp;mph (105&nbsp;km/h) at a position 570&nbsp;miles (915&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Cabo San Lucas]]. Tropical Storm Dalila slowly weakened after moving over progressively cooler water temperatures, and on [[August 1]] it degenerated into a tropical depression. Dalila turned to the southwest after much of the convection waned, and the system dissipated on [[August 2]].<ref name="dalilatcr"/>

On [[July 17]] a [[tropical wave]] exited the coast of [[Africa]], and moved westward. An area of convection along the wave organized slightly on [[July 18]], though the next day the convection diminished. After moving through the [[Windward Islands]] on [[July 23]], deep convection again increased. The system failed to organize further, though convection continued to develop upon entering the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] on [[July 27]]. The cloudiness and thunderstorms became more consolidated off the coast of southern [[Mexico]], and on [[July 31]] [[Dvorak technique|Dvorak classifications]] began on the system.

A large circulation with an area of low pressure persisted in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean in early August. The large circulation was well-developed by [[August 7]], and the convection concentrated a few hundred miles southwest of [[Acapulco]]. Low pressures persisted across the region, and based on its organization the National Hurricane Center designated the system Tropical Depression Seven-E later on the 7th. Based on reports from nearby ships, it is estimated the depression intensified to become Tropical Storm Flossie on [[August 8]]. The storm paralleled the coast of [[Mexico]] as it moved to the northwest at around 8 mph, and after a decrease of [[wind shear]] Flossie developed very deep convection over its center. It intensified into a hurricane on [[August 10]], and shortly thereafter it reached its peak intensity of 80 mph as an embedded warm spot appeared in the center of the storm. After maintaining its peak intensity for 18 hours and passing within 75 miles of [[Baja California Sur|Baja California]], Flossie weakened over cooler waters and degenerated to a tropical storm on [[August 12]]. The storm continued to weaken, and early on [[August 14]] Flossie dissipated.<ref name="flossietcr">{{cite web|author=Edward Rappaport|year=1995|title=Hurricane Flossie Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-10-21|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1995flossie.html}}</ref>

The government of [[Mexico]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warning]] from [[Punta Tejupan]] to [[Cabo Corrientes]] early in its life, though it was discontinued shortly thereafter. Officials issued a tropical storm watch and later a tropical storm warning for [[Baja California Sur]] south of [[La Paz]], which was later extended from [[Loreto]] on the east coast to [[San Juanico]] on the west coast. The large circulation of Hurricane Flossie produced gusty winds and heavy rainfall along the west coast of Mexico and southern [[Baja California Peninsula|Baja California]]. [[Cabo San Lucas]] reported sustained tropical storm force winds with a gust to 55&nbsp;mph (90&nbsp;km/h), while amateur radio reports in [[San Jose del Cabo]] recorded a gust of 65&nbsp;mph (105&nbsp;km/h). Seven people died in Mexico from the storm, including two that drowned in Cabo San Lucas.<ref name="flossietcr"/> The outer [[rainband|bands]] of the storm dropped more than 3&nbsp;inches (75&nbsp;mm) of rain in [[Tucson, Arizona]], resulting in flash flooding at rush hour. A woman drove through a flooded roadway, and died after being swept into a small canyon. Eleven other motorists were stranded from the flooding.

A [[tropical wave]] moved off the coast of [[Africa]] behind [[Hurricane Luis]] on [[August 31]]. Strong outflow from Luis prevented development of the wave, and it continued westward until crossing into the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] on [[September 12]]. Convection increased as it moved through the [[Gulf of Tehuantepec]], and the cloud pattern organized sufficiently to warrant [[Dvorak technique|Dvorak classifications]] for the system on [[September 15]]. Based on the development of a low-level circulation, it is estimated the system organized into Tropical Depression Eleven-E on [[September 16]] while located around 290&nbsp;miles (465&nbsp;km) south of [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]], [[Mexico]].<ref name="juliettetcr">{{cite web|author=Richard J.

The tropical depression was small in size, with a diameter of central deep convection of 60 to 115&nbsp;miles (95 to 185&nbsp;km). Moving to the west-northwest, the depression intensified into a tropical storm on [[September 17]].<ref name="juliettetcr"/> Juliette quickly organized with a well-defined [[rainband|band]] of convection being drawn into the circulation.<ref name="rappaport5">{{cite web|author=Rappaport|year=1995|title=Tropical Storm Juliette Discussion Five|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-11-20|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1995/juliette/tropdisc/nep1195.005}}</ref> The storm quickly intensified, and subsequent to the development of a small [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] Juliette attained hurricane status on [[September 18]], just 42&nbsp;hours after developing. The eye became better defined as the hurricane moved to the west-northwest, a motion caused by a weak [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to its north, and Juliette attained major hurricane status early on [[September 19]]. Possibly due to increased northeastly [[wind shear]] from an upper-level [[trough (meteorology)|trough]], Juliette stopped its intensification trend on the 19th, though as it turned to the west it again re-organized. On [[September 20]], while located 420&nbsp;miles (680&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Cabo San Lucas]], Juliette attained a peak strength of 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h), the strongest tropical cyclone of the season.<ref name="juliettetcr"/>

After maintaining its peak intensity for less than 12 hours, Juliette began to weaken due to an [[eye (cyclone)#Eyewall replacement cycles|eyewall replacement cycle]]. After turning to the west-northwest, the winds of the hurricane dropped to 100 mph by [[September 22]], and the eyewall expanded to about 80&nbsp;miles (130&nbsp;km) in diameter. The eyewall contracted to about 40&nbsp;miles (65&nbsp;km), and as a result Juliette re-strengthened to attain winds of 105 mph (170&nbsp;km/h). An eastward moving trough of low pressure turned the hurricane to the north-northeast into an area of cooler water temperatures and increased [[wind shear]]. Juliette quickly weakened to a tropical storm late on [[September 24]]. The eastward moving trough moved past the storm, resulting in the motion of Juliette turning to a southeast drift. The convection waned and disappeared on [[September 25]], and on [[September 26]] Juliette dissipated while located 450&nbsp;miles (730&nbsp;km) west of the southern tip of the [[Baja California Peninsula]].<ref name="juliettetcr"/>

When the motion of Juliette turned to the northeast, some computer models predicted it to continue northeastward and strike [[Baja California Sur]]. As a result, the government of [[Mexico]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|Tropical Storm Watch]] as a precautionary measure for portions of the state. When the storm weakened rapidly and turned from the coast, the watch was cancelled. Juliette remained away from land masses for its lifetime, and as a result it caused no damage or deaths.<ref name="juliettetcr"/>

The table on the right shows the [[Accumulated Cyclone Energy]] (ACE) for each storm in the season. The total ACE for the 1995 season was 100.2 x 10<sup>4</sup> kt<sup>2</sup>. The ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the storm multiplied by the length of time it existed for, so hurricanes that lasted a long time have higher ACEs. Because several storms in the season were long-lasting or intense, the ACE of the season was near normal. The 1995 season total was the lowest since [[1981 Pacific hurricane season|1981]], though due to a period of inactivity in the following years it has only been surpassed by four seasons.<ref name="ACE">{{cite web|author=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|publisher=[[NOAA]]|year=2005|accessdate=2006-08-10|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/2005/ann/ace-epac-nov30.png|title=East North Pacific ACE: 1949 — 2005}}</ref>

===Retirement===
{{seealso|List of retired Pacific hurricanes}}
The [[World Meteorological Organization]] retired one name in the spring of 1996: Ismael. It was originally replaced in the [[2001 Pacific hurricane season|2001 season]] by Israel, but for political reasons, due to its connection with [[Israel]] and the coincidence that the first name of 2001 was "Adolph" (later retired for similar reasons), this was changed to Ivo after the season began, but before it reached the "I" storm.
