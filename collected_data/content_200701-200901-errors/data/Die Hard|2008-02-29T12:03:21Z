'''''Die Hard''''' is an American action film released in [[1988 in film|1988]]. It was written by [[Jeb Stuart]] and [[Steven E. de Souza]], stars [[Bruce Willis]], [[Bonnie Bedelia]], [[Alan Rickman]], [[Reginald VelJohnson]] and [[William Atherton]], and was directed by [[John McTiernan]]. A huge critical and commercial success, ''Die Hard'' propelled Willis' film career and established Rickman as a popular portrayer of villains in American film. It started the [[Die Hard series]].

The movie is based on a [[1979 in literature|1979]] novel by [[Roderick Thorp]] titled ''[[Nothing Lasts Forever (1979 novel)|Nothing Lasts Forever]]'', itself a sequel to the book ''[[The Detective]]'', which was previously made into [[The Detective (film)|a 1968 movie]] starring [[Frank Sinatra]].

==Plot==
[[John McClane]] (Willis), a [[detective]] with the [[New York City Police Department]], arrives in [[Los Angeles]] to attempt a [[Christmas]] reunion with his estranged wife Holly. He is taken by [[limousine]] driver Argyle to her workplace, the [[high-rise]] Nakatomi Plaza. While Argyle waits in the building's parking garage, McClane joins the Nakatomi Christmas party where he finds Holly and they immediately get into an argument over her use of her maiden name Gennero. Holly leaves McClane in a small room near the party.

A gang led by the suave German [[terrorist]] Hans Gruber (Rickman) invades and completely locks the building down, under the pretense of gaining the release of various terrorist operatives. The party-goers are subdued and it is revealed that the group are actually thieves; they plan to use the false terrorist crisis to cover their theft of $640 million in [[bearer bond]]s from the building's security vault. Theo, the gang's technical mastermind, begins work on disabling the sequential vault locks, warning Gruber that the final [[electro-magnetic]] based lock will be impossible to bypass.

McClane manages to slip away during the round-up of the party-goers, albeit without his shoes. His attempt to summon help via the building's fire alarm brings him into confrontation with gang member Tony. Tony is killed, prompting the man's vengeful brother, Karl, to lead a hunt for the police officer throughout the building. McClane convinces a [[Los Angeles Police Department]] radio-operator to send a patrol unit to Nakatomi, then secures the attention of responding officer Al Powell by dropping the body of one of his pursuers onto the officer's car. He also takes a collection of [[C4 explosives]] and detonators off the body of another gangmember.

[[Image:Foxplazaupclose.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Nakatomi Plaza (in real life, the [[Fox Plaza (Los Angeles)|Fox Plaza]]).]]

The LAPD responds in force, but this merely accelerates Gruber's timetable. With the police led by the incompetent Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson, Powell quickly proves to be McClane's only useful ally outside the building. A [[SWAT]] team and an armored reconnaissance vehicle are easily and brutally repelled, to which McClane retaliates by bombing two of Gruber's men along with an entire floor of the building with some of the C4.

An incensed Gruber orders Karl to track McClane down and recover the detonators while Gruber goes up to the roof access, where he finds himself in an unexpected face-to-face confrontation with McClane. Gruber attempts to pass himself off as a hostage; the ruse is distraction enough that Karl and his team surprise McClane in an ambush. McClane kills more gang-members but is forced to flee, leaving behind the detonators and severely cutting his feet on shattered glass. As he tends his wounds, Powell tells him via radio how he had recently shot a youth "armed" with a toy gun; his grief has him heading for a career as a desk officer.

Outside, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] arrives on the scene in the form of two swaggering agents, Agent Johnson and Special Agent Johnson. The duo order the building's power be cut, which serves only to de-activate the final lock on the building's vault, just as Gruber had planned. He "negotiates" with the FBI to release the hostages on the rooftop via helicopter. The agents plan to double-cross the "terrorists" with a surprise gunship attack, with little regard to the hostages' welfare, while Gruber in fact is planning his own treachery; using the C4 to destroy the entire upper structure of the building, killing all the hostages and covering the gang's escape.

McClane investigates the roof access, wondering about Gruber's earlier presence in that area. Just as he discovers the primed C4, he is attacked by Karl. After a vicious battle, McClane leaves Karl for dead, hanging by the neck from a heavy chain. Back outside the building, an irresponsible TV reporter named Richard Thornburg accidentally alerts Gruber to the fact that Holly is McClane's wife. He takes her aside as a special hostage while his remaining men raid the vault and Theo goes to the parking garage to prepare the gang's getaway [[ambulance]]. Argyle, who has kept up with events via his limo's radio, rams the vehicle with his limousine and punches Theo unconscious.

McClane storms the roof and drives the hostages back down to safety. The FBI agents mistake McClane for a terrorist and fire at him, while Gruber proceeds with the C4 detonation. McClane escapes the blast by jumping over the side of the building with a [[fire hose]] tied around his waist, and shooting his way in through a window a couple of stories down. The rooftop explosion destroys the FBI helicopter.

A battered McClane confronts Gruber one last time high up in the tower, with Holly being held at gunpoint. McClane tricks Gruber with a faked surrender and shoots him. Gruber falls out the window and grabs onto Holly's watch. McClane runs to his wife and undoes her watch and Gruber falls over thirty stories to his death. As McClane and his wife leave the building, the seemingly-indestructible Karl reappears one last time at the doors, only to be gunned down in a surprising act of bravery by the normally desk-bound Powell. Holly and John are approached by Thornburg, still relentlessly angling for a fresh scoop. Holly punches the reporter and the couple departs the scene in Argyle's battered limo.

==Production==

*''Die Hard'' follows its source material — [[Roderick Thorp]]'s novel ''[[Nothing Lasts Forever (1979 novel)|Nothing Lasts Forever]]'' — closely, much of the film's memorable scenes, characters, and dialogue taken directly from the novel. ''Nothing Lasts Forever'', a sequel to Thorp's earlier novel ''[[The Detective]]'', was written with the intention of being adapted into a film sequel to the film adaptation of ''The Detective'', which starred [[Frank Sinatra]]. When Sinatra turned down the offer to star in the sequel, the story was altered to be a stand-alone film with no connections to ''The Detective''. Other changes included the older hero of the novel becoming younger, the hero's daughter becoming his wife, and the American Klaxon Oil Corporation becoming the Japanese Nakatomi Corporation. The novel's tone is darker and more serious than the film's, and the political fighters of the novel became thieves in the film. Director John McTiernan states on the DVD commentary that these changes were made because he wanted to bring "joy" to the story.

*The Nakatomi building is actually the headquarters for [[Twentieth Century Fox]], and the company charged itself rent for use of the (unfinished) building as if the production were simply another tenant of the building, as well as damages for the destruction of the sidewalk guardrail destroyed by the LAPD armored personnel carrier.<ref name="IMDB">{{cite web|title=Trivia for ''Die Hard''|accessdate=2007-07-04|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0095016/trivia}}</ref>

*In the German [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]], the names and backgrounds of the German-born terrorists were changed into English forms (mostly into their British equivalents): Hans became Jack, Karl became Charlie, Heinrich turned into Henry <ref>{{cite web|title=Schnittberichte - Stirb Langsam|accessdate=2007-10-12|url=http://www.schnittberichte.com/schnittbericht.php?ID=1105}}</ref>. The new background depicts them as Irish terrorists having gone freelance and for profit rather than ideals.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} This was because German terrorism (especially by the [[Rote Armee Fraktion]]) was still considered a sensitive issue by the German government in the 1980s.

*According to commentary from the movie's DVD release, Alan Rickman's surprise when Gruber is dropped from the building is genuine: the director chose to release Rickman a full second before he expected it in order to get genuine surprise, a move which angered Rickman. The text commentary track also reveals that the shooting script did not originally feature the meeting between McClane and Gruber pretending to be a hostage; it was only written in when it was discovered that Rickman could do an American accent.

*Whenever Gruber fires his weapon, the scene cuts away. McTiernan did this to avoid showing Rickman's involuntary habit of flinching when the gun recoiled.<ref name="IMDB"/> There is an exception in the shot where Hans fires his gun and orders the hostages to the roof.

*''Die Hard'' was renamed ''Big Building Fight'' in Thailand. In Spain, it was renamed ''La Jungla de Cristal'' (''The Glass Jungle''). In Latin America it was renamed ''Duro de Matar'' (''Hard to Kill''). In Russia the film was named ''Крепкий Орешек'' (''A Hard Nut to Crack'') (word-for-word — ''Hard Nutlet''). In Poland it was named ''Szklana Pułapka'' (''The Glass Trap''). In Portugal it was named ''Assalto ao Arranha-Céus '' (''Assault to the Skyscraper''). In Norway it was named ''Aksjon Skyskraper'' at first, but was later changed to its original name. In France, it was named ''Piège de Cristal'' (''The Crystal Trap''). In Yugoslavia, the film was named ''Umri Muški'' (''Die like a Man''). In Romania, it was renamed "Greu de ucis" ("Hard To Kill", like the Latin American title). In Finland, the film was named "Vain kuolleen ruumiini yli" ("Only over my dead body"). In Germany, the title was "Stirb langsam" ("Die Slowly"). The Hungarian title was "Drágán add az életed" ("Give your life expensive"). In Estonia, the title was translated to "Visa Hing" ("Sturdy Soul").

==Music==
Though composer [[Michael Kamen]] is credited for scoring the film, the conclusion at the bottom of Nakatomi Plaza where the character Karl reappears with a [[Steyr AUG]] rifle, only to be killed by a very surprised Sergeant Powell, features a cut from the 1986 sci-fi action movie [[Aliens (film)|''Aliens'']] composed by [[James Horner]]. The music can be found on the ''Aliens'' soundtrack titled "Resolution and Hyperspace". Both ''Die Hard'' and ''Aliens'' are released through [[20th Century Fox|Twentieth Century Fox]]. "[[Ode to Joy]]" is featured prominently throughout the film.

==Reception==
When ''Die Hard'' was released, it was considered one of the best action films of its era. This is probably in part due to the fact that there are few ''artificial'' [[plot point]]s in the story. It is noted for including humor as a complement to the action and dramatic elements of the story.  It is said to have reinvented the action genre and set the stage for '90s action/thriller movies such as ''[[Under Siege]],'' ''[[Passenger 57]]'' and ''[[Speed (film)|Speed]]''. "''Die Hard'' on a _____" became a common way to describe the plot of many of the action films that came in its wake. For example, for the 1990s action flick, ''Speed,'' was called "''Die Hard'' on a bus"<ref> http://www.foxhome.com/diehard/trinity/dh1/</ref> The movie was also responsible for creating the "action star" archetype that is a far more fallible and human hero, wearing few pieces of clothing, speaking few words (including "[[one-liners]]") and always having a rough look across their face.<ref>''The Movies of the Eighties'' (1990) by Ron Base and David Haslam.</ref> ''Die Hard'' grossed $80,707,729 at the U.S. Box Office.<ref name="yahoodiehard">[[Yahoo!]] Die Hard Movie Details</ref>

It was highly acclaimed by critics<ref name="rottentomatoes_diehard">[[RottenTomatoes]] Aggregated Film Reviews</ref> and spawned three popular sequels: ''[[Die Hard 2]]'' (1990), ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'' (1995) and ''[[Live Free or Die Hard]]'' (2007), all featuring Willis as McClane.

''Die Hard'' was listed at #39 on the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Thrills]] list of the most thrilling American movies of all time in 2001.

In 2003, Hans Gruber was listed at #46 on the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains]] special.

John McClane's infamous line "Yippee ki yay, motherfucker" was voted as #96 of "The 100 Greatest Movie Lines" by [[Premiere (magazine)|''Premiere'' magazine]] in 2007.

In the [[June 22]] [[2007]] issue of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', it was named the best action movie of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN1448232520070615 |title="Die Hard" tops magazine list of best action films |work=[[Reuters]]}}</ref>

==Box office==
''Die Hard'' had a budget of [[United States dollar|$]]28 million. Released in 1,276 theaters, it grossed $7.1 million in its opening weekend. The film earned $83 million domestically and $138.7 million worldwide.
