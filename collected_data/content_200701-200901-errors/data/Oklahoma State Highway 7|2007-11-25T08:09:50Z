'''State Highway 7''', often abbreviated as '''OK-7''' or '''SH-7''', is a 150-mile<ref name="okhighways">{{okhighways|7|2007-03-24}}</ref> (242 km) highway in southern [[Oklahoma]]. This lengthy highway connects many towns in Oklahoma's "[[Little Dixie (Oklahoma)|Little Dixie]]" area. It runs from [[Interstate 44]] in [[Lawton, Oklahoma|Lawton]] to U.S. [[U.S. Route 69|69]]/[[U.S. Route 75|U.S. 75]] in [[Atoka, Oklahoma|Atoka]].

==Route description==
[[Image:177us ok7.jpg|thumb|right|OK-7 shield in Sulphur.]]
From its western terminus at the interchange with Interstate 44 and Lee Boulevard in [[Lawton, Oklahoma|Lawton]], OK-7 is a multilane highway. It runs due east from Lawton for ten miles before intersecting [[State Highway 65 (Oklahoma)|State Highway 65]] in the unincorporated community of [[Pumpkin Center, Oklahoma|Pumpkin Center]]. It continues due east for 14 more miles on a straight stretch of highway only very slight curves, bypassing the town of [[Central High, Oklahoma|Central High]], before meeting [[U.S. Route 81|U.S. 81]] north of [[Duncan, Oklahoma|Duncan]]. 

OK-7 and U.S. 81 overlap for 6 miles through [[Duncan, Oklahoma|Duncan]], after which the state highway splits off to the east once again, still as a multilane highway, though it falls to a two-lane road after a few miles. Next the highway passes through the town of [[Velma, Oklahoma|Velma]] before meeting [[State Highway 76 (Oklahoma)|State Highway 76]] in [[Ratliff City, Oklahoma|Ratliff City]]. The southern section of [[State Highway 74 (Oklahoma)|OK-74]], which roughly mirrors SH-76's path, has its southern terminus at OK-7 seven miles later, near [[Tatums, Oklahoma|Tatums]]. 

After crossing [[Interstate 35]], OK-7 becomes a multilane highway once again. Three miles later, it meets [[U.S. Route 77|U.S. 77]] near [[Davis, Oklahoma|Davis]]. On the other side of Davis, OK-7 is the northern terminus of [[State Highway 110 (Oklahoma)|OK-110]], a connector route to the town of [[Dougherty, Oklahoma|Dougherty]]. Two miles west of Sulphur, the highway connects to the southern terminus of the [[Chickasaw Turnpike]], a toll highway to [[Ada, Oklahoma|Ada]]. After passing through [[Sulphur, Oklahoma|Sulphur]] (where it has a brief concurrency with [[U.S. Route 177|U.S. 177]]), OK-7 travels six more miles, where it meets [[State Highway 1 (Oklahoma)|Highway 1]].

For ten miles, OK-7 and OK-1 overlap, through the town of [[Mill Creek, Oklahoma|Mill Creek]]. This concurrency ends three miles south of Mill Creek, where it serves the unincorporated community of [[Reagan, Oklahoma|Reagan]] and the Slippery Falls Boy Scout Ranch. It shares a one-mile three-route concurrency with [[U.S. Route 377|U.S. 377]]/[[State Highway 99 (Oklahoma)|OK-99]]. Thirteen miles east of the concurrency, it serves the town of [[Wapanucka, Oklahoma]], where it intersects [[State Highway 48 (Oklahoma)|OK-48]]. Seventeen miles later, it ends at U.S. 75 in [[Atoka]].

==History==
OK-7 is a former border to border east-west state highway across southern Oklahoma whose western terminus was at the [[Texas]] border west of [[Hollis, Oklahoma|Hollis]] and eastern terminus at the [[Arkansas]] border east of [[Broken Bow, Oklahoma|Broken Bow]].<ref name="okhighways"/> OK-7's route was truncated on its eastern and western sections during the 1960s and 1970s as those were concurrent with [[U.S. Route 62|U.S. 62]] between the Texas border and [[Lawton, Oklahoma|Lawton]] and with [[U.S. Route 70|U.S. 70]] between Broken Bow and the Arkansas border.<ref name="roadklahoma">{{cite web|last=McMahon|first=Martin|url=http://roads.tulok.net/t-7.html|title=Terminus: SH-7|work=Roadklahoma|accessdate=2007-03-24}}</ref> The eastern portion of OK-7 that was concurrent with U.S. 70 between Broken Bow and the Arkansas border was truncated in 1963 to its junction with U.S. 70 in Broken Bow.<ref>{{cite map|publisher=Oklahoma Department of Transportation|title=Official State Highway Map|edition=1963}}</ref> The western section of OK-7 concurrent with U.S. 62 from Lawton to the Texas border was truncated in 1970<ref>{{cite map|publisher=Oklahoma Department of Transportation|title=Official State Highway Map|edition=1971}}</ref>, when the highway's western terminus was pushed back to the to the intersection of Cache Road (U.S. 62) and Sheridan Road in Lawton, and a few miles further back in 2003 to its current terminus at Interstate 44 in east Lawton.<ref>{{cite map|publisher=Oklahoma Department of Transportation|title=Official State Highway Map|edition=2003-2004}}</ref>   

Along still-intact sections of OK-7, major route changes through the years include a relocation in [[Duncan, Oklahoma|Duncan]] during the early 1950s{{fact|date=April 2007}}, when the original route along Main Street through the downtown area was moved south of the business district along Bois D'Arc Avenue from U.S. 81 eastward to tie in with the original Main Street route on Duncan's east side, which became OK-7 Alternate and now designated as OK-7 Business. In 1969, the main Bois D'Arc Avenue alignment in Duncan was relocated slightly to the south and the rerouting continued for some 20 miles from the OK-7/OK-7 Business junction to [[Velma, Oklahoma|Velma]] on a new and straighter alignment (including both multi-lane divided highway and two-lane roadway) that bypassed the old OK-7 alignment through the oil fields of eastern Stephens County along with the town of Velma.<ref>{{cite map|publisher=Oklahoma Department of Transportation|title=Official State Highway Map|edition=1970}}</ref> In the 1980s, the new OK-7 was extended east of Velma past the small community of County Line on the Stephens/Carter county line to west of [[Ratliff City, Oklahoma|Ratliff City]] in Carter County.<ref name="odot85">{{cite map|publisher=Oklahoma Department of Transportation|title=Official State Highway Map|edition=1985}}</ref><ref name="odot86">{{cite map|publisher=Oklahoma Department of Transportation|title=Official State Highway Map|edition=1986}}</ref>

By 1985, the eastern terminus of OK-7 was pushed back to its intersection with OK-3 and U.S. 69/75 in [[Atoka, Oklahoma|Atoka]] when OK-7 was again truncated and lost its concurrency with OK-3 from Atoka to Broken Bow.<ref name="odot85"/>

==Spurs==
SH-7 has two spur routes: 

* '''OK-7B''', also signed as '''Business OK-7''', is the original alignment of OK-7 through Duncan. 
* '''OK-7D''' is a 3.5 mile spur to the town of [[Bromide, Oklahoma|Bromide]].
