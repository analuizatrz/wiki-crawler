[[Image:Jackie Chan Fist.JPG|thumb|left|Jackie Chan began his film career as a stuntman in the [[Bruce Lee]] films ''[[Fist of Fury]]'' (1972) and ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' (1973, pictured).]]
Jackie Chan was born in 1954 on [[Victoria Peak]], [[Hong Kong]], as Chan Kong Sang (meaning "born in Hong Kong") to [[Charles and Lee-Lee Chan]], refugees from the [[Chinese Civil War]]. He was nicknamed ''Pao Pao'' ({{zh-c|c=炮炮}}, literally meaning "Cannonball") because he was always rolling around as an infant.<ref>{{cite web

Chan attended the Nah-Hwa Primary School on [[Hong Kong Island]], where he failed his first year, after which his parents withdrew him from the school. In 1960, his father emigrated to [[Canberra]], [[Australia]] to work as head cook for the American embassy, and Chan was sent to the Chinese Drama Academy, a [[Peking Opera School]] run by Master [[Yu Jim Yuen]].<ref name=Tiscali/><ref name=CelebValues>{{cite web

Chan appeared with Li again the following year, in ''[[The Love Eterne]]'' (1963) and had a small role in [[King Hu]]'s 1966 film, ''[[Come Drink with Me]]''. After an appearance as an extra in another King Hu film, ''[[A Touch of Zen]]'', Chan began his adult career in the film industry.

==Film career==

[[Image:DrunkenMaster DVDcover.jpg|thumb|right|The 1978 film ''[[Drunken Master]]'' brought Jackie Chan into the mainstream.]]
===Early exploits: 1976–1980===
In 1976, Jackie Chan received a telegram from Willie Chan, a film producer in the Hong Kong film industry who had been impressed with Jackie's stuntwork. Willie Chan offered him an acting role in a film directed by [[Lo Wei]], who planned to model him after [[Bruce Lee]] with the film ''[[New Fist of Fury]]''. His stage name was changed to Sing Lung (Chinese: 成龍, literally "become the dragon") to emphasise his similarity to Bruce Lee, whose stage name was Lei Siu Lung (Chinese: 李小龍, meaning "Little Dragon"). The film was unsuccessful because Chan was not accustomed to Lee's martial arts style. Despite the film's failure, Lo Wei continued producing films with similar themes, resulting in little improvement at the box office.<ref name="FightingMaster">{{cite web

Chan's first major breakthrough was the 1978 film ''[[Snake in the Eagle's Shadow]]'', shot while he was loaned to Seasonal Film Corporation under a two-picture deal.<ref>{{cite web

Upon Chan's return to Lo Wei's studio, Lo tried to replicate the comedic approach of ''Drunken Master'', producing ''[[Half a Loaf of Kung Fu]]'' and ''[[Spiritual Kung Fu]]''.<ref name="Iamjc" /> He also gave Chan the opportunity to co-direct ''[[Fearless Hyena]]'' with [[Kenneth Tsang]]. When Willie Chan left the company, he advised Jackie to decide for himself whether to or not to stay with Lo Wei. During the shooting of [[Fearless Hyena Part II]], Chan broke his contract and joined [[Golden Harvest]], prompting Lo to blackmail Chan with [[Triad society|triads]], blaming Willie for his star's departure. The dispute was resolved with the help of fellow actor and director [[Jimmy Wang Yu]], allowing Chan to stay with Golden Harvest.<ref name="Jcm">{{cite web

===Success of the action comedy genre: 1980–1987 ===
[[Image:Jcpmall.JPG|thumb|left|The film ''[[Police Story (film)|Police Story]]'', nicknamed "Glass Story" for its stunt work, is set in a modern period.]]
Willie Chan had become Jackie's personal manager and firm friend, and has remained so for over 30 years. He was instrumental in launching Chan's international career, beginning with his first forays into the [[American film industry]] in the 1980s.
His first Hollywood film was ''[[Battle Creek Brawl]]'' in 1980. Chan then played a minor role in the 1981 film ''[[The Cannonball Run (film)|The Cannonball Run]]'', which grossed [[United States dollar|US$]]100 million worldwide. Despite being largely ignored by audiences in favour of established American actors like [[Burt Reynolds]], Chan was impressed by the [[outtakes]] shown at the [[closing credits]], inspiring him to include the same device in his future films. After the commercial failure of ''[[The Protector (1985 film)|The Protector]]'' in 1985, Chan temporarily abandoned his attempts to break into the US market, returning his focus to [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong films]].<ref name=FightingMaster/>

Back in Hong Kong, Chan's films began to reach a larger audience in [[East Asia]], with early successes in the lucrative Japanese market including ''[[The Young Master]]'' (1980) and ''[[Dragon Lord]]'' (1982).
Chan produced a number of action comedy films with his opera school friends Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao. The three co-starred together for the first time in 1983 in ''[[Project A]]'', which won the Best Action Design Award at the third annual [[Hong Kong Film Awards]].<ref>{{cite web

===Acclaimed sequels and Hollywood breakthrough: 1988–1998===
[[Image:Rumble In The Bronx.jpg|thumb|right|Chan in his [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] breakthrough film ''[[Rumble in the Bronx]].'']]
In 1988 Chan starred alongside Hung and Yuen for the last time to date, in the film ''[[Dragons Forever]]''. Hung co-directed with [[Corey Yuen]], and the villain in the film was [[Yuen Wah]], both of whom were fellow graduates of the China Drama Academy.

In the late 1980s and early 90s, Chan starred in a number of successful sequels beginning with ''[[Police Story 2]]'', which won the award for Best Action Choreography at the 1989 [[Hong Kong Film Awards]]. This was followed by ''[[Armour of God II: Operation Condor]]'',  and ''[[Police Story 3]]'', for which Chan won the Best Actor Award at the 1993 [[Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards|Golden Horse Film Festival]]. In 1994, Chan reprised his role as [[Wong Fei Hung]] in ''[[Drunken Master II]]'', which was listed in ''[[Time Magazine|Time Magazine's]]'' All-Time 100 Movies.<ref>{{cite web

Jackie Chan rekindled his [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] ambitions in the 1990s, but refused early offers to play villains in Hollywood films to avoid being [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] in future roles. For example, [[Sylvester Stallone]] offered him the role of [[Simon Phoenix]], a criminal in the futuristic film ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]''.

Chan has been injured numerous times attempting stunts; many of them have been shown as outtakes or [[blooper]]s during the closing credits of his films. He came closest to death filming ''[[Armour of God]]'', when he fell from a tree and fractured his skull, resulting in a permanent hole in his head. Over the years, Chan has dislocated his pelvis and broken his fingers, toes, nose, both cheekbones, hips, sternum, neck and ribs on numerous occasions.<ref>{{cite web

==Filmography and screen persona==
{{see|Jackie Chan filmography}}
Jackie Chan created his screen persona as a response to Bruce Lee, and the [[Bruceploitation|numerous imitators]] who appeared before and after Lee's death. In contrast to Lee's characters, who were typically stern, morally upright heroes, Chan plays well-meaning, slightly foolish regular guys (often at the mercy of their friends, girlfriends or families) who always triumph in the end despite the odds.<ref name=Iamjc /> Despite the success of the ''Rush Hour'' series, Chan has stated that he is not a fan of it since he neither appreciates the action scenes in the movie, nor understands American humour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,298648,00.html|title=Jackie Chan Admits He Is Not a Fan of 'Rush Hour' Films|date=[[2007-09-30]]|accessdate=2007-10-01}}</ref>
