{{Final Fantasy characters}}
The twelfth game of the ''[[Final Fantasy (series)|Final Fantasy]]'' series, [[Square Enix]]'s console role-playing game ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'' revolves on the attempt to liberate the kingdom of Dalmasca from the Archadian Empire. The story is told through the eyes of Vaan, an orphan who wishes to be a sky pirate - high flying tomb raiders. His adventures brought him to a cadre of other characters that shape the course of the story. The characters were designed by [[Akihiko Yoshida]], and it continues the tradition of realistically proportioned characters, as the world of ''Final Fantasy XII'' is rendered to scale relative to the characters in it; instead of a caricature of the character roaming around miniature terrain, as found in previous ''Final Fantasy'' games, every area is represented proportionally. 

There are a total of six main [[playable characters]] in ''Final Fantasy XII''; [[#Vaan|Vaan]], an energetic orphan of Rabanastre who dreams of becoming a sky pirate; [[#Ashelia B'nargin Dalmasca|Ashe]], a determined princess of Dalmasca who lost her husband in the Archadian invasion; [[#Sir Basch fon Ronsenburg|Basch]], a disgraced knight of Dalmasca charged with treason for slaying the king; [[#Balthier|Balthier]], a gentlemanly sky pirate who pilots his airship, the Strahl; [[#Fran|Fran]], Balthier's partner and a viera exile whose knowledge extends to legends and myths; and [[#Penelo|Penelo]], Vaan's childhood friend who accompanies him in journeys to keep an eye over him.<ref name="BRADY6">{{cite book |editor= BradyGAMES |title=Final Fantasy XII Official Strategy Guide |year=2006 |publisher=DKPublishing |isbn=0-7440-0837-9 |pages=6-9 }}</ref> There is also one playable minor character ([[#Reks|Reks]], the older brother of Vaan) and three [[non-player character]]s who become "Guests". These "Guest" characters join in the battles with the main characters in the story, though the duration of their joining is determined by the story's plotline. There are also "Allies" who fight on the player's side only a single battle - typically being for Mark Hunts - and in plotline battles. In ''[[Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings]]'', there are four additional main playable characters; [[#Kytes|Kytes]] and [[#Filo|Filo]], two orphans from Rabanastre; [[#Llyud|Llyud]], a resident of Lemures, and [[#Ba'Gamnan|Ba'Gamnan]], a sinister bounty hunter who has a grudge against Vaan and gang for meddling in his affairs. The characters for ''Revenant Wings''' are designed by Ryoma Itō.

Comments were made about the similarity between character designer [[Akihiko Yoshida]]'s creations and those of [[Tetsuya Nomura]], another Square Enix character designer. Yoshida feels this connection is sparked by the style of color used by both artists, which involves a color consistency between the characters and the environments.<ref name="Q&A1">{{cite web | author=IGN Staff| year=November 20, 2003| title=Final Fantasy XII Q&A (page 1 of 4)| format= | work=IGN.com | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/441/441293p1.html | accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref> The designers stated that non-human characters and races feature a prominent role in the game,<ref name="AkiInterview">{{cite web | author=Aki Sugawara| year=November 20, 2003| title=Feature: A Final Fantasy XII Interview (page 2)| format= | work= | url=http://www.gamepro.com/sony/ps2/games/features/31808.shtml | accessdate=2006-12-14}}</ref> which was influenced by an interest in history among the developers.<ref name="Q&A">{{cite web | author=IGN Staff| year=November 20, 2003| title=Final Fantasy XII Q&A (page 2 of 4)| format= | work=IGN.com | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/441/441293p2.html | accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref> Comparing the non-human races in ''Final Fantasy IX'' with ''Final Fantasy XII'', the former was modeled after humans, while the latter was fundamentally different in terms of biological characteristics.<ref name="GamespotQA">{{cite web | author=Gamespot Staff| year=November 20, 2003| title=Q&A: Final Fantasy XII developers | format= | work=Gamespot.com | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/finalfantasy12/news_6084068.html | accessdate=2007-04-12}}</ref> Bangaas that made its first appearance in ''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance'' was also originally designed for ''Final Fantasy XII'', as well as other races that were featured in the said game.<ref name="GamespotQA" />

Basch was initially meant to be the main character of the story, but the focus was eventually shifted to Vaan and Penelo when the two characters were created later in development. The development team explained that their previous game, ''[[Vagrant Story]]'', which featured a "strong man in his prime" as the protagonist had been unsuccessful and unpopular; the change regarding ''Final Fantasy XII'' from a "big and tough" protagonist to a more effeminate one was thus decided after targeting demographics were considered. With the casting of [[Japanese television drama|dorama]] actor [[:ja:武田航平|Kouhei Takeda]] for the voice acting and motion capture, Vaan nevertheless became a little less feminine and more "active, upbeat bright and positive" than planned.<ref name="Q&A1" /><ref name="FrenchInterview">{{cite web | author=Final Fantasy Ring Staff| year=February 28, 2007| title=Sortie française de ''Final Fantasy XII'' : le Compte rendu | format= | work=ffring.com | url=http://www.ffring.com/articles/divers-sortie-francaise-de-Final-Fantasy-XII.html | language=French | accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref> For Ashe, Akihiko Yoshida stated that her physical features were designed with the intent of making her look vaguely French: "the base of her bone structure is a French person's. We were given orders from the start to not make her look like an Asian. But we modified her a bit to look more like a Japanese for the sake of the Japanese audience, and also since a character that looks completely French makes some of the CG expressions difficult."<ref name="GamespotQA" />  The geography of the fictional land of Ivalice, particularly Dalmasca, had an influence in the character's initial designs. When asked about Ashe's rather revealing clothing, Yoshida commented that "Dalmasca is supposed to have a hot climate", and that the idea of the characters revealing skin was his.<ref name="GamespotQA" />

The Plague took them both. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> His only brother, Reks, died two years prior to the start of the game, during the Archadian Invasion of Dalmasca. He makes a living as Migelo's assistant, running various errands for him, while at the same time pickpocketing from Archadian soldiers while claiming to take back what is Dalmasca's. <ref>'''Penelo''': I thought that this money was the people of Dalmasca’s property. The Imperials stole it from us, so it’s only fair that we take it back. It’s our duty as Dalmascans. Well, wasn’t that what you said? {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> He is a cheerful and energetic boy, and among his friends he is considered their leader.

During the events of ''Revenant Wings'', Vaan becomes captain of the Airship Galbana and uses it to travel to Lemures, meeting old friends while making new ones. The fact he was given the title of the "leading man" by Balthier, suggests a teacher/student relationship between them by the others. Vaan also gains the Godblade Anastasia from the Yahri. In the aftermath, Vaan and Penelo take their leave from Rabanastre to have their own adventure.

Vaan also made appearances in other video games.

Ashe or {{nihongo|Ashelia B'nargin Dalmasca|アーシェ・バナルガン・ダルマスカ|Āshe Banarugan Darumasuka}} is a 19 year-old Hume princess and main female protagonist of the game, fighting to liberate her kingdom, Dalmasca, from the Archadian Empire. The only living child of King Raminas and the sole heir to the throne,<ref>Square Enix Co.: ''Final Fantasy XII Australiasia instruction manual'' (2006). Square Enix Co., 12.</ref> she married [[Characters of Final Fantasy XII#Rasler Heios Nabradia|Rasler Heios Nabradia]] shortly before Archadia's invasion of Dalmasca. Her husband died in the battle to protect Nalbina Fortress directly following their marriage, (on the border of fellow Nabradia, Rasler's home state), making Ashe a young [[widow]]. Though their people believed that their marriage was political, they actually loved each other, evident as she still grieves for him and still wears her wedding ring two years after his death.<ref>'''Rasler''': A marriage of convenience. A symbol of the alliance between Nabradia and Dalmasca. This is how they see our match. / '''Ashe''': They do, do they? / '''Rasler''': These roles we play. I must admit I find it... wearying. / '''Ashe''': I will play mine. / '''Rasler''': I would have no other. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2|language=English}}</ref> She was thought to have committed [[suicide]], but took on the alias, {{nihongo|Amalia|アマリア|Amaria}}, to serve as the leader of the Resistance before joining the group.<ref>'''Basch''': A leader of the Resistance has fallen into Imperial hands. A woman by the name of Amalia. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> Her intention on getting revenge on Archadia, for the horrors its militant forces had committed on her people, was manipulated by the Occuria to reinforce their rule over Ivalice. Along the course of the story, the Occuria created an image of the late Rasler to lead Ashe wherever they needed her to go. In their encounter, the Occuria offered her Nethicite to rule as another Dynast-King, and conquer Ivalice at their stead.<ref>'''Gerun''': The Nethicite is ours to give, to chosen bearer or to none. The heretic trespassed and set the rose of knowledge in Man's hand. With imitations they profane, it is anathema to us. We give you now the Stone and task. Administer judgment: destroy them all! / '''Ashe''': Judgment? Destroy them all? The Empire? {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> At the final moment, however, Ashe rejects the Occuria's offer and declined to use the Nethicite.<ref>'''"Rasler"''': You are our saint, Ashelia B’nargin. You must use the Nethicite You must be the one to straighten history's weave! / '''Ashe''': I am no false saint for you to use! {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> Ashe acknowledges Larsa's intention to stop the war between the two empires, and finally makes her way to Vayne in the Sky Fortress ''Bahamut'' to end it.<ref>'''Ashe''': We need not fight all the Empire to win. If we can get to Vayne, we can put an end to this war. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref>

A year after the Bahamut's crash, Ashe is crowned Queen of Dalmasca and eventually rejoins her friends in protecting the peace they had ensured from the mysterious Judge of Wings on Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings. Her main weapon eventually becomes hand-bombs instead of being a sword wielding warrior.

Despite having been created for ''Final Fantasy XII'', Ashe was first introduced in the 2004 crossover board game ''[[Itadaki Street#Itadaki Street Special|Itadaki Street Special]]''. She also appears in ''[[Itadaki Street Portable]]''.

{{nihongo|Basch fon Ronsenburg|バッシュ・フォン・ローゼンバーグ|Basshu fon Rōzenbāgu}} is a 36 year-old Captain in the Order of Knights of Dalmasca. He was born in the Republic of Landis, along with his [[twin]] brother Noah. After the Archadian Empire conquered their homeland, Basch fled to Dalmasca, becoming a prominent and beloved member of the Kingdom. When Archadia attacked Nalbina Fortress, Basch led the defense. He, along with Lord Rasler Heios Nabradia, valiantly defended the fortress against the invading armies of Archadia.<ref>'''Raminas''': Secure Nalbina with all haste. / '''Basch''': I will go. / '''Rasler''': And I will go at his side.{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> However, the Archadian forces proved too much for them to handle. Basch was the one responsible for carrying Lord Rasler from the field of battle after he was mortally wounded by an arrow to the chest (despite Basch's efforts to stop the assailant). After the Archadian occupation, he and Captain Azelas led an assault on Nalbina Fortress in an attempt to save the king, only to be captured by Imperial forces. As part of Vayne's plot to frame Basch, Noah, now Gabranth, posed as his brother and slew the Dalmascan king and later Vaan's older brother, Reks, who witnessed the crime. As a result, Basch is regarded by the Dalmascans as a traitor, and was stated to have been executed by Marquis Ondore.<ref>'''Ondore''': Know also that Capt. Basch fon Ronsenburg, for Incitement of Sedition and the Assassination of H.R.M. King Raminas, has been found Guilty of High Treason and put to his Death. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> In reality, Basch was imprisoned alive in the Nalbina Dungeons by Vayne as a means of ensuring Ondore remains loyal to the Empire - if Ondore betrayed the Empire, all Vayne would have to do would be to announce Basch's continued survival to destroy the Marquis' credibility.<ref>'''Ondore''': So you are the sword he’s strung above my head. Vayne has left not a thing to chance. And? {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref>

He was eventually freed by Vaan, Balthier, and Fran who were trying to escape Nalbina dungeons. Though all three were initially suspicious of him, Vaan in particular, the party did catch a look at Gabranth's face, lending credibility to Basch's story that he had been framed.<ref>'''Balthier''': A twin brother? Fancy that. Hmm. But still, the pieces fit. I’ll give
you that much. And he did look like you. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> After the escape, he vowed to protect Ashe and help the resistance, in spite of his past failures. He remained loyal as well, even through such events as Vossler's betrayal.<ref>'''Basch''': After Vayne’s ruse I had abandoned hope for honor... Yet never did I forget my knightly vows. If I could protect but one person from war’s horror... then I would bear any shame. I would bear it proudly. I could not defend my home. What is shame to me? {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref>It was Basch's devotion to honor despite everything else that most puzzled his twin, Gabranth, and was the source of the division between them.<ref>'''Gabranth''': You confound me, brother! You failed Landis, you failed Dalmasca... all you were to protect. Yet you still hold on to your honor. How? / '''Basch''': I had someone more important to defend. And defend her I have. How is it that you have survived? Is it not because you defend Lord Larsa? {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> Eventually coming to respect Basch's viewpoint more than his own, Gabranth sought to redeem himself and remained true to his own devotion to Larsa Solidor, helping his brother and Ashe defeat Vayne on the ''Bahamut''.<ref>'''Vayne''': The hound strays. Treason bears a price. / '''Gabranth''': One I gladly pay! {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> After the battle, as Noah was dying, he asked his brother to protect Larsa in his place to ensure peace.<ref>'''Gabranth''': Basch. Look after Larsa, will you? If house Solidor should crumble, the Empire would fail, and civil war would take us all. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> Because common belief of Captain Ronsenberg being dead, Basch easily took over his brother's stead as "Judge Magister Gabranth" to be the protector of the new Emperor Larsa Solidor. 

In the sequel ''Revenant Wings'', though a Judge on false pretenses, Basch intends to protect the peace he and the others obtained when he journeyed as Larsa's representative to deal with the Judge of Wings. Basch's presence affects Kytes, who wishes to be like him someday. He also appears in ''[[Itadaki Street Portable]]''.

Balthier, known as {{nihongo|Balflear|バルフレア|Barufurea}} in the original [[Japanese language]] version, is a twenty-two year-old Hume sky pirate who pilots the ''Strahl'', a small [[airship (video game)|airship]], around the skies of Ivalice. He and his companion, Fran, prefer to remain outside of the war between the kingdoms of Ivalice.<ref>'''Balthier''': Mmm. I try to steer clear of such things. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2|language=English}}</ref>  However, their attempt to steal the Goddess's Magicite, later revealed to be the Dusk Shard, from the Dalmascan Royal Palace went bad; Vaan stole it first, and, caught in the fray of a rebel assault against the Imperial Palace, Balthier and Fran find themselves going against Archadia.

Born {{nihongo|Ffamran Mid Bunansa|ファムラン・ミド・ブナンザ|Famuran Mido Bunanza}}, he is the son of Dr. [[Cid (Final Fantasy)|Cid]] (Cidolfus Demen Bunansa), though he grew weary of his father's madness and obsession with Nethicite. Although Cid had made him an Imperial Judge, Ffamran eventually decided to cut his ties with his father and his role as a judge, becoming a sky pirate under a new name.<ref>'''Balthier''': I left the Judges... and him. Cidolfus Demen Bunansa. Draklor Laboratory’s very own Doctor Cid. That’s when he lost his heart to Nethicite, lost himself. And I suppose that’s when I lost my father. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2|language=English}}</ref> With this new career change, Balthier amounted a sizable bounty on his head, attracting the attention of bounty hunters such as Ba'Gamnan. Unfortunately for Balthier, it took him a while to realize he'd been following his father in pursuing Nethicite while he served in the resistance.<ref>'''Balthier''': Funny I went for the Dusk Shard. How could I have known that it was Nethicite? And then, of course, I met you. All that running, and I got nowhere. It’s time to end this—cut my ties to the past. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2|language=English}}</ref> Though he made peace with his father prior to his death, Balthier went with the group to destroy the Sky Fortress ''Bahamut'' as penance for his father's deeds.

Balthier claims to be the "leading man" of the story many times throughout the game, and insists that this status makes him invincible.<ref>'''Balthier''': And what did they say about the leading man? He never dies. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2|language=English}}</ref> This viewpoint draws credibility from his near-death experience when the Bahamut crashed near Rabanastre. Though presumed dead, he and Fran apparently retrieved the ''Strahl'' back from Vaan and Penelo a year later, leaving a note for the new Queen Ashe indicating that they are still alive.<ref>'''Balthier''': Give this to our Queen for me, would you? {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2|language=English}}</ref> Both he and Fran intend on finding the Cache of Glabados, which is resolved in the game's sequel, ''Revenant Wings'' when it turned out to tied to Eternal. Balthier was at first intent to take Lemures' treasure, the Auracite, but knew the truth behind it and attempted to destroy the Auralith, eventually rejoining Vaan's group to fight the Judge of Wings, letting Vaan be the "leading man" while he himself leaves the limelight.

Balthier made a crossover appearance in ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions]]''. He also appears in ''[[Itadaki Street Portable]]''.

Fran's hometown is Eruyt Village, a small enclave in Golmore Jungle where the viera dwell. She left Eruyt Village and cast aside the Green Word fifty years prior to the events occurring in the game, believing that although her kind begin with the forest, they do not necessarily have to be bound to its end.<ref>'''Fran''': The viera may begin as part of the Wood, but it is not the only end that

Bur-Omisace, which lay past Golmore; unfortunately, the paths are sealed by Jote, Fran's older sister.

Fran, like all viera, is exceptionally susceptible to the Mist that permeates Ivalice; with the burning of mist within Nethicite affect her from entering a feral rage, when Judge Ghis heated the Dawn Shard in his airship's engine, to being severely overwhelmed like with the Sun Cryst. Likewise, she could tell that the Mist was cooled in the Giruvegan. Of all the characters, she seems to be the wisest - fitting, as she is far older than the rest of the cast, despite her youthful appearance.<ref>'''Fran''': Do not worry. I will behave myself.

==Other major characters==
===Vayne Carudas Solidor===
{| class="wikitable"

|-
|[[Elijah Alexander (actor)|Elijah Alexander]]
|[[Nobuo Tobita]]
|}

{{nihongo|Vayne Carudas Solidor|ヴェイン・カルダス・ソリドール|Vein Karudasu Soridōru}} Vayne is the third son of Emperor Gramis and Larsa's older brother, as well as the primary antagonist of the game. He is the twenty-seven year-old Consul-Governor of Archadian-occupied Dalmasca, Commandant of the Archadian Empire's Western Armada and a member of House Solidor, whose members had led the Empire for four generations. This in effect makes him a "Prince", though as he states, the democratic nature of the Empire makes him no more eligible for the throne than anyone. He often laughs off those who attempt to give him the respect his title would command and makes efforts to reach out to the conquered Dalmascans who make up his jurisdiction.

However, while he honestly cares for the welfare of the people and of his family, particularly his younger brother Larsa, Vayne is Machiavellian in his methods, willing to use any means necessary to maintain order.  He ensures the complete subjugation of Nabradia and Dalmasca, even exterminating their royal families, in order to acquire their deifacted nethicite.  He confronts Dalmasca's resistance movement with absolute ruthlessness, accepting no surrender.  He even goes so far as to murder his own ailing father and frame the Imperial senators, to put an end to their scheming against himself and Larsa.  Vayne's ultimate goal is to free humanity from the control of the Occurians, a race of god-like beings that have, for centuries; secretly meddled with the course of human history. In doing so, he undertakes his noblest goal - freeing humanity from the slavery of the gods - and commits his ultimate act of villainy - toppling kingdoms, building massive warships, and leveling entire cities in nethecite testing experiments - in order to achieve his goal. 

During the Battle over Rabanastre, Vayne commanded the Sky Fortress Bahamut, and when confronted by the team, used the Nethicite to become '''Vayne Novus''' before being mortally wounded by Vaan. But Venat awards Vayne for helping it by sacrficing itself to give him the power of an Occurian, causing Vayne to become the monstrous '''Undying''', grafting pieces of the Bahamut's superstructure onto his body. Despite this monstrosity's incredible destructive power, a furious battle with the team eventually forced his mechanical body to break apart, and in the resulting explosion caused Vayne to be blasted into oblivion.

===Larsa Ferrinas Solidor===
{| class="wikitable"

|[[Johnny McKeown]]
|[[Yuka Imai]]

{{nihongo|'''Larsa Ferrinas Solidor'''|ラーサー・ファルナス・ソリドール|Rāsā Farunasu Soridōru}} is the fourth son to Emperor Gramis, and brother to Vayne. He is by far and quite obviously the Emperor's favorite, and Gramis works tirelessly to ensure that Larsa remains pure and free from the stain of politics and war. Though only twelve years old, Larsa is very idealistic (and equally naive) and believes that the strife within Ivalice can be quelled without war. Larsa possesses a great deal of respect for House Solidor and the men of his family, especially his older brother, whom he more or less adores. The Senate, however, fears Vayne's growing power and the perceived threat to their own, and thus plot from the beginning of the game to place Larsa on the throne with the hopes of easily manipulating him from behind the scenes. 

Luckily, Larsa is more than capable of taking up the sword of House Solidor. He travels with Vaan and company, under the alias "Lamont" during their trip to the Lhusu Mines to rescue Penelo. However, his knowledge of Nethicite exposes him. Larsa helps Vaan and company escape from the ''Leviathan'' and later joins the party again at Jahara, urging Ashe to use her influence on the Resistance to prevent an aggravation between the warring countries. He leaves the party at Mt. Bur-Omisace, after learning from Al-Cid Margrace that his father had been murdered, attempting to reason with Vayne. However, seeing Vayne wouldn't listen to reason, Larsa aided Vaan and company in battling Vayne. After his brother is defeated, Larsa takes his place in the Archadian throne and settles into peace agreements with Basch as his protector.

In ''Revenant Wings'', Larsa arrives to the Dalmacian Easternsand with Basch, joining the Galbana's crew with intent to stop the Judge of Wings who is creating Anti-Archadian propaganda with her actions. Though he was fearful that Kytes and Filo may not like him and may still bare grudges against the Empire, he was relieved that was not the case.

===Archadian Judges===
The Archadian Judges are a special order of knights under the Imperial Archadian Ministry of Law. With the spread of Archadian influence came a rise in crime and regional conflicts. To reduce the amount of time required by judicial process, a military court was established, this being the origin of the Order of Judges. They are the supreme enforcers of Archadian law in the world of Ivalice. Each wields extraordinary legal power in his or her own right over lower-ranked Archadian officers. The higher ranked Judge Magisters, in addition to functioning as chief arbiters and enforcers of Archadian law, are also the elite guard of House Solidor which effectively makes them the commanders of the Imperial Army.

====Judge Magister Gabranth====

|}
{{nihongo|Gabranth|ガブラス|Gaburasu}}, born {{nihongo|Noah fon Ronsenburg|ノア・フォン・ローゼンバーグ|Noa fon Rōzenbāgu}}, is the Judge Magister of the 9th Bureau. The 9th Bureau, led by Gabranth, is primarily concerned with the gathering and dissemination of information. As a result, many of the bureau’s activities are shrouded in secrecy. Gabranth, and his power, are respected by the other Judge Magisters, and Emperor Gramis himself places great faith in this younger Judge. He is also Basch's twin brother, the man truly responsible for the deaths of Reks and King Raminas. Unlike Basch, he wholeheartedly supports Archadia. After the fall of Landis, Basch left for another country leaving Noah and their mother, who was suffering from an illness at the time, behind. But Noah couldn't leave their mother in her condition, and moved with her to her home country of Archadia. In an effort to distance himself from Landis, he took on his mother's surname, Gabranth. Noticed by Emperor Gramis, Gabranth joins the Archadian Judges with the Emperor's backing and rises to become a Judge Magister. Eventually his mother succumbs to her illness and dies, and Gabranth's feelings towards his brother finally change to hatred for what he sees as him abandoning his homeland and family. At the Emperor's behest, he acted as an informant on the dealings of Lord Vayne and became Larsa's protector. Despite these facts, Gabranth loathes himself for the framing of his brother and the horrible tasks Vayne and the Empire have commanded him to do, such as killing Drace to prove his loyalty as Archadia's "Hound". He accompanies Bergan and Zargabaath to Mt. Bur-Omisace where Larsa agrees to return with him, to avoid any trouble. Gabranth later was sent to Pharos to "test" Ashe if she would take revenge, attacking the group in personal rage when they refused to extact vengeance for the wrongs against them as he had. Towards the end of the game, after realizing why his brother remains with a positive outlook despite his life ruined, Gabranth decides to make up for his wrongs by protecting Larsa and helping the Resistance kill Vayne for the good of the Empire. He is fatally injured by Vayne in the process, before Larsa arrived to his defense. After the battle, from aboard the Strahl, Basch poses as Gabranth to announce, along with Larsa and Ashe, the surrender of the Imperial fleet. At the same time, Gabranth lies in the back of the Strahl, mortally wounded. He dies after requesting that Basch takes up his mantle to serve and protect the new Emperor Larsa. In the aftermath of the game, Basch takes up his brother's request, serving as the next "Gabranth" and Larsa's protector.

====Judge Magister Ghis==== 
{| class="wikitable"

|-
|[[Mark Wing-Davey]]
|[[Ryūsuke Ōbayashi]]

{{nihongo|Ghis|ギース|Gīsu}} is the officiant of the 13th Bureau and commander of the Dreadnought ''Leviathan'', the flagship of the 8th Fleet of the Western Armada, led by Lord Vayne. In addition to official duties as Judge Magister, he also worked in secret, carrying out tasks assigned him by Vayne personally, though he had no love for his master. Ghis was the one responsible for guarding and supervising the young Lord Larsa during his visit to Bhujerba and fought Vaan when he and the others freed Ashe from the ''Leviathan''. He was later ordered by Vayne to seek out the Dawn Shard, the last of the ancient relics left by King Raithwall. Ghis' ''Leviathan'', leading the 8th Fleet, travelled over the Jagd Yensa to Raithwall's tomb to retrieve the stone, once again capturing Vaan and company in the process. Onboard, Ghis revealed to Lady Ashe that Captain Azelas had made a deal with the Empire, that in return for the Dawn Shard the Kingdom of Dalmasca would be restored. To determine whether or not the Dawn Shard was truly deifacted nethicite or not Ghis had his science staff test it. Due to the ship's lack of proper testing facilities the science staff chose to use the ''Leviathan's'' drive as a test bed. Pleased with the test results, Ghis planned to use the stone to further his own ambitions, possibly using it to stage a [[coup]] in order to place himself into power, or to assassinate Vayne, whom he detested. However, the immense power of the Dawn Shard quickly overloaded the ship's drive and resulted in a cascade failure causing the ship to implode. Ghis died for his hubris on the ''Leviathan's'' bridge, taking it, and the rest of the 8th Fleet of the Archadian Imperial Army, with him.

====Judge Magister Bergan==== 
{| class="wikitable"

|-
|[[Gary Martin (actor)|Gary Martin]]
|[[Yōsuke Akimoto]]

{{nihongo|Bergan|ベルガ|Beruga}} is the Judge Magister of the Archadian Imperial Army and director of the 2nd Bureau. A warrior by training, he had a personal affinity for weapons and combat. His experience with warfare positioned him as the Empire’s preeminent Judge overseeing invasion and military envoys. The most autocratic of all the Judges in both word and deed, as well as the strongest due to his use of manufactured nethicite. A staunch supporter of Lord Vayne (also a believer in administration by force), he dedicated his life to ensuring that Vayne’s aspirations came to fruition. Bergan, along with Judges Zargabaath and Gabranth, travelled to Mt. Bur-Omisace to retrieve Larsa. The Imperial forces, commanded by Bergan, cut a bloody swath through the Kiltias during their merciless onslaught, sparing no one. Though Larsa agreed to return with them to avoid trouble, Bergan had other ideas. Bergan, in a fit of rage, attacked Al-Cid. When Vaan and company arrived at the Hall of the Light, to their dismay, they found Bergan hovering over His Grace Anastasis' lifeless body. Bergan, wielding two unique-looking swords, both heavy in appearance, demanded that Lady Ashe relinquish the Sword of Kings to him, ranting about how Ivalice hails her true Dynast-King, Vayne Solidor. He engaged Ashe and the others. Having set his very bones about with manufacted nethicite, his strength had been increased exponentially and he had been possessed by Venat as well in the process, which drove him into an insane frenzy. The nethicite however, already possessing too much power for Bergan's frail Hume body to handle, violently killed him in the midst of the battle.

====Judge Magister Drace==== 
{| class="wikitable"
!English Cast!! Japanese Cast
|-
|[[Julia Fletcher]]
|[[Yoko Soumi]]
|}
{{nihongo|Drace|ドレイス|Doreisu}} is Larsa's guardian and surrogate mother, being the only female Judge Magister. Drace acted as advisor to Larsa and was charged with overseeing his education and up bringing. She was a staunch supporter of Lord Larsa and was confident that, as Emperor, he'd be much more than a mere puppet for the Senate to control. Knowing all too well that once the Senate realized Larsa's true capabilities that they would present a danger to him, she, along with her comrade Judge Gabranth, agreed to protect the young Lord from harm. Drace also harbored much ill will toward Lord Vayne, believing him to be ruthless beyond contempt, taking the lives of two of his own brothers. Drace had suspected foul play on Vayne's part when Emperor Gramis was poisoned and the Senate, who had been charged with the Emperor's assassination, were stripped of all authority and Vayne was granted "temporary" powers of autocracy until order could be restored. She loudly voiced her opinion despite Judge Zargabaath's warning of caution. She attempted to place Vayne under arrest after he lamented on the fact that House Solidor had been reduced, with the murder of their father, to himself and his "dear brother" Larsa. However, she herself, was placed in check (at sword point) by Judge Bergan who noted that because it was the Archadian Ministry of Law that granted Vayne autocratic authority, she, as Judge Magister, betrayed the very law which she herself served by bearing her sword at Vayne. Out of spite, Drace attempted to assault Bergan, who, with inhuman strength, easily overpowered her. Convicted and found "guilty", Vayne ordered Gabranth to perform his duties as Judge Magister and execute Drace, despite Zargabaath's plea of mercy, as proof of his loyalty to his new "master". No longer caring to live, Drace tells a hesitant Gabranth to go ahead and do his duty saying 'pray be quick', but not before telling Gabranth to live and protect the young Lord Larsa. Gabranth, regretfully, ends Drace's life with her own sword.

====Judge Magister Zargabaath====

|[[Simon Templeman]]

{{nihongo|Zargabaath|ザルガバース|Zarugabāsu}} is Captain of the ''Alexander'', flagship of the 12th Dalmascan Fleet of the Archadian Army. A strictly military man who was absolutely loyal to the Empire. He was ordered by Vayne himself to take the airship ''Alexander'' and retrieve the young Lord Larsa. Though loyal to the Empire, he was an honorable man whose conscience was sometimes at odds with his loyalties. He pleaded with Vayne when he sentenced Judge Drace to death and he later took little comfort in Judge Bergan's merciless onslaught upon the Kiltias at Mt. Bur-Omisace, lamenting on how "the Empire's debts grow legion". During the final confrontation between the Empire and the Resistance, Zargabaath, from the ''Alexander'', served as second-in-command of the Imperial Fleet in conjunction with Vayne and the ''Bahamut''. He thought very ill of the Resistance forces, arrogantly exclaiming to himself "is this their worst". However, the Resistance forces managed to hold their own and even gain the upper hand. After Vayne was defeated and the ''Bahamut'' fell the Imperial forces had essentially been defeated and at the behest of Larsa, who assumed command of the Imperial Fleet after his brother's death, the Imperial forces ceased fire. When the derelict ''Bahamut'' began its fall toward Rabanastre, Zargabaath honorably offered to use the ''Alexander'' in a suicide mission to ram the sky fortress away from Rabanastre before it fell upon the city. However, before he could enact his plan, Balthier and Fran's actions onboard the plummeting sky fortress prevented it from being necessary. Zargabaath was the only one of the college of known Judge Magisters to survive the events of the game.

{{nihongo|Gramis Gana Solidor|グラミス・ガンナ・ソリドール|Guramisu Ganna Soridōru}} is the father of Vayne and Larsa and the fourth Emperor of Archadia.  However, even he is not immune to the scheming of the Senate who suggested that Larsa be his successor. Gramis was filled with regret for the deaths of his two oldest sons, whom he gave Vayne the order to kill. After refusing to dethrone the Senate as wished by Vayne, whom he feared would be a danger to their empire, he is eventually assassinated at Vayne's hand. With the Emperor murdered, the blame for it was focused on Chairman Gregoroth and other members of the Senate, resulting into their disbandment by the newly crowned Vayne.

{{nihongo|The Senate|元老院|Genrōin}} is a council of elderly Archadian Senators, headed by {{nihongo|Chairman Gregoroth|グレゴロス議長|Guregorosu Gichō}}, who meets to discuss the course of Archadia's future in the Senate Chambers. The Senate is influential over the Emperor's decision, particularly the suggestion to remove Vayne and rein in Larsa as future heir to the Empire. Gregoroth was found to have poisoned the Emperor and commit suicide, though this is doubted even amongst the Judge Magisters. The Senate was disbanded soon after, effectively making Vayne the unquestioned ruler of Archadia.

{{nihongo|Cidolfus Demen Bunansa|シドルファス・デム・ブナンザ|Shidorufasu Demu Bunanza}}, also referred to as Dr. Cid, is a fifty-eight year old Archadian scientist who is close friends with Vayne, despite age differences, and currently engaged in studying Nethicite. He is the man responsible for discovering the technology behind all of Archadia's airships. He is revealed to be [[List of Final Fantasy XII characters#Balthier|Balthier]]'s father, whose ambitions drove Balthier away from the father he used to know. 

This incident was the result of Cid going to Giruvegan to study more of the Nethicite, only to return as a maniacal shell of his former self. Dr. Cid became so obsessed with his research on Nethicite that it eventually warped his mind, making him slightly mad. Doctor Cid seems to talk to himself quite a bit but, in reality, he is speaking to Venat. Under Venat's guidance, Cid helped Vayne encourage the war to gain shards of the Sun-Cryst in order to help him create Manufacted, or artificial, Nethicite. Cid is confronted by Balthier and company at the Draklor Laboratory in Archades, which results in a fight after the doctor tried to kill them with two guns powered by Nethicite. Cid survives the encounter and flees. Cid go to the Pharos to envoke the Sun-Cryst's full power, revealing himself once Gabranth is defeated, scolding the Judge for his failing his mission as Larsa's protector any more and tells him that he is no longer needed. Enraged, Gabranth tries to attack Cid, who teleports out of the way as Venat throws the judge against a wall. Cid fights his son and the rest of the party once again, this time with help from the Esper, Famfrit. Cid dies after the battle, dissolving into energy absorbed by the Sun-Cryst before it is destroyed and fully activates his final airship, the ''Bahamut''. This is the first ''Final Fantasy'' game to feature a [[Cid (Final Fantasy)|Cid]] character as a villain.

{{nihongo|Ba'Gamnan|バッガモナン|Baggamonan}} is a green-skinned Bangaa mercenary who is after the bounty on [[List of Final Fantasy XII characters#Balthier|Balthier]] by any means with the aid of his equally cruel henchmen: Rinok, Gijuk and Bwagi, who refer to him as "big brother" and follow him out of fear. Though he acts as an arrogant free agent, he was secretly working for Gabranth whom he fears to an extent. Ba'Gamnan's weapon of choice is a type of chainsaw-staff called the Bangangsaw, making him an extremely dangerous opponent in battle. Even though he is a bounty hunter most foul, his notoriety is due to his illegal methods, like kidnapping Penelo and later attacking the hunters from Clan Centurio to lure out Balthier. This later strategy involved the killing the hunters, to ensure no one would be the wiser. But rumors spread and Montblanc set up the "Belito" Elite Mark Hunt to lure Ba'Gamnan and his crew out into the Nam-Yensa Sandsea with aid from fellow Clan hunter Monid, Vaan and company. Ba'Gamnan and group were eventually defeated, with their leader falling into the Sandsea. 

Though Ba'Gamnan survived, he ironically marked with his own bounty by the Empire under Larsa's rule, thus seeing Vaan and his friends to blame for his recent misfortunes, bent on revenge. By around ''Revenant Wings'', when attempting to take inactive Galbana as their own to hunt down Balthier, Ba'Gamnan and his group managed to corner Vaan, Kytes and Filo until they used the Auracite to beat him and drive his posse anyway. Soon after, Ba'Gamnan was tied up until Tomaj outfited the Bangaa with a shock muzzle, referred as "Ba'Gamnan's Bane", to keep him in line as a part of their group. But, over time, he eventually overcame the shock muzzle and he kidnapped Filo. It took the entire gang with aid from Rikken's group to beat the Bangaa bounty hunter, with Rikken's group taking him for the bounty. However, Ba'Gamnan escaped them and forcefully recruited his siblings back into his gang to settle things with Balthier and Vaan's gang in vain. Ba'Gamnan would later make a final attempt of revenge in the game after the Judge of Wings was defeated, escaping to fight another day.

Rasler goes into a coma from the wound and eventually dies from it, widowing Ashe. He seems to appear to Ashe in the game as a ghost figure, and sometimes to Vaan, but this apparition was actually an Occurian illusion designed to lead Ashe on the path they wanted.

{{nihongo|Vossler York Azelas|ヴォースラ・ヨーク・アズラス|Vōsura Yōku Azurasu}} is a former Dalmascan Knight and a close colleague of Basch.  Vossler fought alongside Basch, during the counter-attack at Nalbina Fortress. Like Reks, he too was tricked into thinking Basch was responsible for killing King Raminas. After the battle, he fled underground, and joined the Resistance, alongside Princess Ashe. For the next two years, he protected the Princess, as well as trying to restore their lost Kingdom.

During the events of ''Final Fantasy XII'', he reunites with Basch, after the captain escaped Nalbina Dungeon with Vaan. Skeptical of the traitor, Vossler eventually learns to trust his friend once again. They meet up on the Leviathan, when they are on their way to rescue Ashe. Vossler dons an Archadian judge armor to fool the guards and enable them to rescue the Princess, and escape to Bhujerba where they plan to keep the Princess safe.

However, the Princess decides to take matters in her own hands and travel to the Tomb of Raithwall to obtain the treasure of the Dynast-King. Vossler catches up, after being left behind, at the Ogir-Yensa Sandsea, while on their way to the Tomb. He offers to protect Princess Ashe once again, despite objecting to Balthier and Fran's invading the royal tomb. However, once the party gets the treasure; the Dawn Shard, from the tomb, they are taken aboard the Leviathan once again. Here, Vossler reveals that he, embittered by their "profitless battle", has made a deal with the Archadian Empire so that Dalmasca's sovereignty could be restored. However, Vossler dies soon after on the Shiva, where he and his men are attacked by Fran in a mist rage. While the ship sinks, Vossler tells Basch that it's up to him to protect the Princess now. As Ashe and the others escape in an airship, the nethicite explosion from the Leviathan annihilates the fleet, and Vossler with it.

Ondore is also Ashe's uncle, serving as the preacher to her wedding and Rasler's funeral soon after. Ondore was rumored to have connections with the Dalmascan Liberation Army, even though he appears to have yielded to an Archadian rule. It is due to the fact that Ondore, in his attempt to keep peace with the Archadian Empire, announced the fake execution of Basch, who was actually being kept prisoner in the Nalbina Dungeons. That act in turn made Ondore nothing but a "puppet ruler" blackmailed by Vayne if he should cross him. Once the Archadian 8th Fleet was destroyed, Ondore withdrew from his position and began to gather all rebel forces and enlisted Rozarria's aid for a grand assault against the Archadian Empire. Ondore plays a sort of "Narrator" character in the story, as his memoirs are read during certain points of the game.

{{nihongo|Al-Cid Margrace|アルシド・マルガラス|Arushido Marugarasu}} is a member of the Rozarrian ruling family, the House of Margrace.<ref>'''Larsa''': (to Ashe) This is the man I wanted you to meet. Believe it or not, he is a member of the noble House Margrace, rulers of the Rozarrian Empire. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy XII |developer=Square Enix |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2|language=English}}</ref> He is usually accompanied by his lady assistants he refers to as his 'birds' who hold his sunglasses for him when he is not using them, being a gentleman in personality with respect for all women and has no forgiveness for any who dares to harm them. A master of espionage, intelligence networking, and political tricks, Al-Cid not only kept excellent track of the movements of the Archadian Empire, but also kept the military forces of his own country at bay. He attempted to aid [[List of Final Fantasy XII characters#Larsa Solidor|Larsa]] with a plan to stop the potential war in a non-violent fashion, but Gramis's death and the eventual dictatorship of Vayne reduced that chance to nearly nothing. Al-Cid was forced to return to his homeland to persuade his people not to take action in vain. Despite his efforts in removing the hard-line generals in Rozarria, however, Al-Cid could only delay the military might of Rozarria from mobilizing in their "assistance" of the Resistance.

Al-Cid was initially given only a small role in the original storyline, but Norio Wakamoto, his voice actor, had "voiced Al-Cid in such an interesting way" that the developers decided to expand on Al-Cid's role.

Al-Cid Margarce will make an appearance in ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift]]''.

|[[Takayuki Sugo]]

{{nihongo|Reddas|レダス|Redasu}} is a sky pirate from Balfonheim whose crew is composed of Rikken, Raz and Elza. In truth, he was originally the missing Judge Magister {{nihongo|Foris Zecht|フォーリス・ゼクト|Fōrisu Zekuto}} of Archadia. In the war with Nabradia, he was responsible for the Midlight Shard destroying the kingdom under orders from Cid without being told what the effect would be. Filled with guilt, he abandoned his post and took on the name "Reddas", arriving in Balfonheim where he cleaned up the town and became a patron to pirates. He was eventually approached by Ondore who asked that he retrieve Deifacted Nethicite from Doctor Cid. Later, he accompanied Ashe to the Pharos at Ridorana to find the Sun-Cryst. When Cid activated the Sun-Cryst, Reddas sacrificed himself by using the Sword of Kings to destroy the crystal, unleashing an explosion which vaporized him and most of the upper Pharos.

===Occuria===
The {{nihongo|[[Ivalice#Mythology|Occuria]]|オキューリア|Okyūria}} are immortal beings, often called (by both themselves and others) {{nihongo|"the Undying"|不滅なる神|Fumetsunaru Kami}}. Referred to as gods by some, but unknown to the major religions in Ivalice, the Occuria race played a vital role in the history of Ivalice such as the creation of the Espers and granting power to King Raithwall to conquer the countries of Ivalice, granting him the Dawn, Dusk, and Midlight shards. Due to this, they are directly responsible for the formation of the Galtean Alliance and the golden days of Ivalice that followed.

====Venat====

|[[Narumi Tsunoda]]

{{nihongo|'''Venat'''|ヴェーネス|Vēnesu}} an Occuria who defied Gerun and the other Occuria due to being  puppet-masters of Ivalice's fate, Venat was labeled a "heretic" as a result of Venat's goal for a future not controlled by its race. It taught Doctor Cid and Vayne the secrets of Nethicite to allow them to manufacture it themselves by using Magicite from Lhusu Mines and other mines. This influence led to Cid's madness and Vayne's quest for power as they sought out the Nethicite shards originally cut by Raithwall for study. In response, Gerun and the other Occurians attempted to regain their power by manipulating Ashe with an apparition of Lord Rasler. Venat is also seen controlling Fran's little sister Mjrn on an experiment on what Manufacted Nethicite's effect on viera with Dr. Cid in Henne Mines, also Controlled Judge Bergan in Mt. Bur-Omisace and made Bergan kill most of the people of Mt. Bur-Omisace to test the Manufacted Nethicite's true power. Venat's ambitions were ultimately fulfilled when Ashe resisted the Occurians' plans and Reddas destroyed the Sun-Cryst. When Vayne was weak and dying aboard the ''Bahamut'' following his defeat, he thought he failed Venat. Venat told him their goals were fulfilled beyond his knowing and the "Age of Stones" was over, dissolving into whisps of energy that infused Vayne with its power, turning him into the Undying as a result, so that the two might "walk the path" of death together.

{{nihongo|Gerun|ゲルン|Gerun}} is the leader of the Occuria who wanted to control history and the future of Ivalice. It and the other Occuria sealed Feolthanos and people on Lemurés long ago when Feolthanos refused to follow them. During the events of ''Final Fantasy XII'', to counter Venat helping Archadia develop artificial Nethicite to overthrow their control, Gerun used the image of Rasler to spure Ashe's lust for revenge on Archadia before allowing Ashe to see it and the other Occuria as they give her the Treaty Blade to take the Nethicite shards from the Sun-Cryst and conquer the world as Raithwall did, preserving their hold on the world as a result. Ashe resisted and refused to carry out the deed, ending Occurian control over Ivalice.

Against the rules of his people, Llyud aided Vaan and Penelo in protecting Lemurés, branded a heretic as a result. At first, Llyud was like the rest of his kind: socially withdrawn, seemingly emotionless, and rarely interacts with anyone outside his race. But as his time with Vaan and company, along with Auraliths being destroyed, allowed Llyud to develop relationships with others and show moments of genuine emotion. But when Feolthanos departs, Llyud succeeds him as the leader of the Aegyl, promising to see his friends again after he and his people find their place in Ivalice.

In battle, he uses a spear and starts with the abilities Jump and Revive.

===Cu Sith===
{{nihongo|Cu Sith|クーシー|Kūshī}} is a "Master Artificer", a [[Ivalice#Mythology|Yarhi]] alchemist working in the Galbana under Tomaj as his apprentice, though he tends to refer her as "it" or by her kind's name.

===Velis===
{{nihongo|Velis|ウィリス|Wirisu}} was a Nalbinan soldier who somehow ended up on Lemurés. Found Vaan and company, the Velis that Penelo developed feelings for was revealed as an illusion of the real Velius created by the Judge of Wings in an attempt to resurrect him.

===Mydia===
{{nihongo|Mydia|ミディア|Midia}} is a "Feol viera", a halfbreed descendant of the Aegyl Feolthanos and a viera. From a young age, Mydia learned of her descend to the Aegyl leader from her mother before leaving to the outside world to understand more. At Rabanastre, she met and fell in love with Velis, whose death caused her to turn to Feolthanos for a means to revive Velis. However, she instead was given armor and was later referred as the {{nihongo|Judge of Wings|翼のジャッジ|Tsubasa no Jajji}} by the Sky Pirates gathering Auracite for her. When she used the Auracite in a vain attempt to resurrect Velis, she relinquished her soul and was fully possessed by her ancestor, becoming his acting force as a threat to the land of Ivalice. But though she regain some of her anima, Mydia slaughtered her people out of preversed mercy before dying in battle, using her anima to open the way for Vaan's group to Feolthanos' keep.

===Feolthanos===
{{nihongo|Feolthanos|フォルサノス|Forusanosu}} is formerly an aegyl chief who took a viera wife and started the lineage of the Feol viera. He later refused to obey the Occuria, and took his people to Lemurés, using the three Auraliths to create a barrier to protect themselves from the Occurians' wrath, trapping themselves as a result. The aegyl then began to turn the anger they held against the Occuria on their own race, starting many feuds and wars. Fearing for his race, Feolthanos encased himself in an Aurilith, becoming the "Eternal", and used the power of the Auriliths and Auricite to drain his people of their Anima, rendering them emotionless and without souls. Due to his absorbing of Anima and countless years of confinement, he developed a hatred for the Occuria and other races that were under their control, losing his own anima as a result of his immortality. Centuries later, thanks to the Mist released by the SunCryst's destruction, the barrier around Lemurés faded, giving Feolthanos the chance to seek revenge. Once free, he converted his descendant Mydia into the incarnation of his rage against Ivalice while having her gathering more auracite for him use those who hunger for power to become stronger. Vaan and his friends fight Feolthanos' summoned monsters in his floating palace but he absorbed too much souls before the party defeated the monsters, then they fight him as ''Feolthanus Exultant'' and then fight him in his throne room, with Vaan narrowly escaping him until the others can pitch in to defeat the deluded aegyl, restoring his anima as he willingly departed into death.

===Clan Centurio===
A resident clan based in Rabanastre, {{nihongo|Clan Centurio|クラン「セントリオ」|Kuran "Sentorio"}} was founded by the young moogle Montblanc.  The clan's charge is to fell dangerous beasts called Marks that pose a threat to the populace of Ivalice, although its true hidden purpose is to cultivate hunters strong enough to defeat the most powerful monster to ever set foot on Ivalice, Yiazmat, the Wyrm God.  Yiazmat had killed Montblanc's master several years ago, and ever since he has searched for a way to exact his revenge.

Clans are special groups in the world of Ivalice, formed by small alliances of hunters, that are aimed at hunting the most dangerous monsters, or Marks, that are posted as threats to the lives of the individuals of Ivalice. This is not done just out of a sense of honor- there's also considerable money to be had. It can be thought of as specialized [[bounty hunting]]. This is the ordinary business of clans, but they also sometimes hunt special Marks called Elite Marks, more powerful beasts-with correspondingly larger bounties. 

Initially, there were only two major Clans in Ivalice; Clan Centurio is slowly progressing in the ranks, gaining popularity across Ivalice, and is the only real competitor with either of the larger two Clans. Clan Centurio is the only clan the player interacts with, and is the clan Vaan joins at the start of the game. Some of the notable members names could be found in ''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance'', albeit with different spelling.

Notable members:

====Montblanc====
{{nihongo|Montblanc|モンブラン|Monburan}} is the leader of Clan Centurio, who is responsible for supervising Vaan's clan hunt progress. Appeared in ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]'' as a playable character. He also seems to have a wide affiliation with other guilds and organizations around Ivalice, such as his sister Gurdy, who runs the Chocobo stables of the world. It is his desire to not only see Clan Centurio as the most prestigious of all clans, but to avenge his master's death at the hands of Yiazmat. He is one of the six Moogle siblings, the others being Nono, Gurdy, Hurdy, Horne, and Sorbet.

Montblanc will also make an appearance in ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift]]''.

====Monid====
Monid, known as {{nihongo|Mōni|モーニ|}} in the Japanese version, is a Bangaa clan member of high rank. He is initially dismissive of Vaan, who he views as a weak hunter. Cantankerous at first, this clashes oddly with his habit of talking to a small Hume child in the clan hall. It is revealed that the child is the son of Monid's hunter friends, killed by the "Trickster" Mark, to whom their deaths he promises to avenge. Monid is also responsible for helping Montblanc set the hunter stalker bait by using the "Belito" Mark. After these two Mark hunts were pulled off successfully with Vaan's aid, Monid came to respect him as one of the best hunters in the clan.

====Krjn====
{{nihongo|Krjn|カロリーヌ|Karorīnu}} is a viera who is also one of the founding members. Aided Vaan's clan hunt for the "Carrot" Mark. She is the sister of Ktjn, a viera who can be aided in various ways in the city of Rabanastre. Her sister regards her as cold, and strong, though Krjn herself makes no note of this.

====Bansat====
{{nihongo|Bansat|バンサト|Bansato}} is a Seeq member who aided Vaan's clan hunt for the "Gil Snapper" Mark in the Tracks of the Beast area in Giza Plains. A jolly fellow, he readily recognizes Vaan as "tougher than me!" when Vaan reaches a high enough Clan Rank.

====Ma'kenroh====
{{nihongo|Ma'kenroh|マッケンロー|Makkenrō}} is a Nu Mou who is also one of the founding members. He offers advice on hunts, but unlike other members, he does not participate in battle; other clan members mention this, stating that he uses other talents to aid Montblanc. He and Montblanc are old friends, explaining his presence in the Clan Hall. Incidentally, he is the only Nu Mou in all of Rabanastre.

==Cultural impact==
===Merchandise===
In conjunction with the game's release, Square Enix has produced a lineup of merchandise including jewelry, action figures and other goods related to the characters. Most of the merchandise are released in Japan. Such jewelry include Vaan's necklace and Ashe's wedding ring, among other Judge Magister-themed items. A [[plush doll]] of Nono and four full-colored action figures of Ashe, Balthier, Vaan and Judge Gabranth have also been displayed in the Square Enix Japan merchandise page.

===Reception and criticism===
The characters in ''Final Fantasy XII'' have received a mixture of praise and criticism from reviewers. Praises were given by PSX Extreme, stating that the characters are "classy and well thought out, an ensemble cast whose players rarely descend into needless melodrama or writhing angst". The supposed main character's role was changed to become an observer, "a different outlook than in the previous installments".<ref>{{cite web | author=Smith, Cavin | year=November 27, 2006| title=Final Fantasy XII | format= | work=GameRankings.com | url=http://www.gamerankings.com/itemrankings/launchreview.asp?reviewid=746286 | accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref> 1up.com applauded the character dialogues as being "intelligent, subtle and sharp", and the relationships between characters were lauded as well.  Balthier and Fran's relationship was compared to Han Solo and Chewbacca of [[Star Wars]] fame, being "far more interesting than anything Square's put out in the modern FF era".<ref>{{cite web | author=Pfister, Andrew | year=October 27, 2006| title=Final Fantasy XII PS2 Review | format= | work=1up.com | url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3154731 | accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref>

Other reviewers have criticized the character development. The [[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]] found the game's cast "a tad mundane" compared to characters from previous installments. Moreover, they found both Vaan and Ashe uninteresting, making the story lack "the emotional punch".  They also criticized the voice acting as uneven and rife with mispronunciations. <ref>{{cite web | author=Bettenhausen, Shane | year=October 30, 2006| title=Reviews: Final Fantasy XII | format= | work=Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine | url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3154753&sec=REVIEWS | accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref>
