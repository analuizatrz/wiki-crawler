The '''France national rugby union team''' is a national sporting side, representing [[France]] in [[rugby union]]. Rugby union is a popular sport in France, and the national team are one of the best in the world. France compete annually with [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] in the [[Six Nations Championship]]. They have won the competition outright on 14 occasions, shared in another eight wins and completed eight [[Grand_Slam_%28Rugby_Union%29#Six_Nations_Championship|grand slams]]. As of [[March 15]], 2007, they are the [[IRB World Rankings|second-ranked team]] in the world, behind only the [[All Blacks]].<ref name=WorldRank>{{cite web | publisher=irb.com|title=IRB World Rankings |url=http://www.irb.com/EN/World+Rankings/  |accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref> France have competed at every [[Rugby World Cup]] and been runners-up twice. Six former French players have been inducted into the [[International Rugby Hall of Fame]].

France traditionally play in [[blue]] shirts with [[white]] shorts and [[red]] socks, and are commonly referred to as the ''les tricolors'' and ''les bleus''. Their alternative strip is mainly white. French internationals are played at a variety of venues throughout the country, though it is [[Stade de France]] in the [[Paris]] suburb of [[Saint-Denis]] that is used for their games during the Six Nations. France are the host nation of the upcoming [[2007 Rugby World Cup]].

==History==
:''See main'': [[History of the French national rugby union team]]

Rugby was introduced to France in 1872 by the British and on [[New Year's Day]], [[1906]] the national side played its first [[Test match]] against the All Blacks in Paris. France played irregularly against the [[Home Nations]] until they joined them to form a Five Nations tournament (today, the Six Nations Championship) in 1910. France also competed in early [[Summer Olympics]] games winning one gold and two silver medals. In 1932 the French were ejected from the Five Nations mainly due to accusations of professionalism in the French leagues, and did not rejoin until 1939. During this period the team created a winning streak which still stands today. France came of age during the 1950s and 1960s, winning their first of many Five Nations as well as completing a successful tour of South Africa. They won their first [[Grand Slam (rugby union)#Six Nations Championship|Grand Slam]] in 1968, and won numerous titles in the following years. The [[1987 Rugby World Cup|first Rugby World Cup]] was held in 1987 and France became runners-up, losing to the All Blacks in the final. They would repeat their best result again in [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999]], losing to [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] in the final.

==Strip==
[[Image:Logo XV de france.JPG|250px|thumb|Uniform of the French team]]
Until 1912, the uniform of the French team was not blue and did not have a rooster on it, but was white with two rings, one red and one blue. The rings were chosen by France  as its symbol for the Olympic games, there were only two rings because only two continents, America and Europe, participated in the Olympic games at that time.<ref name="logo1">{{fr icon}}{{cite web | url=http://www.sncf.com/actu/rugby/LSDT-premier-maillot-Equipe-France.html| title=Le premier maillot de l'Equipe de France | publisher=Sncf.com | accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref>

After the first game won by France, against Scotland in 1911, Marcel Communeau who was then captain of the French team, asked that the team adopt the ''coq'' (rooster) as its symbol.<ref name="logo2">{{fr icon}}{{cite web | url=http://rugby-nomades.qc.ca/info-nomades/histoire_1911.php| title=2 janvier 1911 : la naissance d’une Nation | publisher=Rugby-nomades.qc.ca | accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref> The rooster was probably chosen because it is considered as a proud and combative animal, that can be sometimes aggressive. The rooster was used previously as a symbol by a French team, a former soccer player, Jean Rigal, wore a uniform with this emblem as early as May 1910.<ref name="logo3">{{fr icon}}{{cite web | url=http://crdp.ac-bordeaux.fr/rugby/arts/5-01-02.pdf| title=Le coq dans le sport  | publisher=Crdp.ac-bordeaux.fr | accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref>

The badge was initially white and red, it was embroidered and multicoloured after 1945, and later golden since 1970.<ref name="logo4">{{fr icon}}{{cite web | url=http://crdp.ac-bordeaux.fr/rugby/arts/5-01-01.pdf| title=Le coq sportif | publisher=Crdp.ac-bordeaux.fr | accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref> The representation of the rooster was first realistic and detailed, later the outline was simplified, it is now abstract and stylized.

The symbol used by the French rugby team had a great success , it was later adopted by the French delegation at the Olympic games of 1920, the rooster is then perched on five Olympic rings.<ref name="logo5">{{fr icon}}{{cite web | url=http://www.museedusport.fr/histoire_objet.php| title=Ecusson en forme de coq, devenu emblème national | publisher=Musee du Sport | accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref> The rooster is well known as the symbol of French teams, French players are sometimes called ''les coqs'' and some French supporters used to bring and release a rooster on the playing field before a game starts.

The French team traditionaly played in Blue shirts whites shorts and red socks, as as such they were nicknamed ''les tricolors''. In the new Nike strip The French team currently plays in a mostly blue uniform, which had lead to the team being relered to as ''les Beus'' (The Blue). When necessary (home games in Scotland and Italy), French players wear white colours, the reason for the home side changing strip is due to the age old rugby tradition of the home side changing strips in the event of a colour clash.

==Grounds==
[[Image:France All Blacks 16-11-2002.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Stade de France during a France-All Blacks fixture.]]
France plays internationals at a number of grounds throughout the country. Home matches during the Six Nations are played at Stade de France. During the 2005 and 2006 seasons, France played home internationals at venues such as [[Stade de France]], [[Saint Denis]]; [[Stade Gerland]], [[Lyon]]; [[Stade Vélodrome]], [[Marseille]]; [[Stade de la Beaujoire]], [[Nantes]] and [[Stadium Municipal|Stadium de Toulouse]], [[Toulouse]].

At the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], there are ten venues being used for matches throughout the country (Cardiff, Wales and Edinburgh, Scotland will also host some games). The French cities hosting matches at the World Cup are [[Stade Félix Bollaert]], [[Lens]]; Stade de France, Saint-Denis; [[Parc des Princes]], [[Paris]]; Stade de la Beaujoire, Nantes; [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]], [[Bordeaux]], Stade Gerland, Lyon; [[Stade Geoffroy-Guichard]], [[Saint-Étienne]], [[Stade de la Mosson]], [[Montpellier]]; Stadium de Toulouse, Toulouse and Stade Vélodrome, Marseille. The final of the World Cup will be played at Stade de France.

Though 2007 is the first Rugby World Cup hosted by France, there have been multiple games played in France earlier during the [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]] and [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999]] tournaments (primarily hosted by England and Wales respectively). In 1991, all Pool D matches (France's pool) were held around France, along with two quarter finals (England v France at Parc des Princes and New Zealand v Canada at [[Stadium Lille-Metropole]]). In 1999, similar to 1991, all Pool C (France's pool) matches were held around France along with one second round play-off and quarter final (at Stade de France).

During the early years France played internationals at venues such as Parc des Princes in Paris and the [[Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir|Stade Olympique de Colombes]] (also in Paris). The Stade Olympique de Colombes, or the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir, was the main venue at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]], where rugby was also a sport. The largest stadium that France currently plays at is Stade de France, which is where the [[Top 14]] final is also held. It has a capacity of around 80,000.

==Record==
===Six Nations===
Frances' only annual tournament is the [[Six Nations Championship]], which is played against five other European Nations; England, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. France first contested the tournament in 1910 when the Home Nations became the Five Nations (Italy would later join in 2000). Not playing during the 1932–1939 seasons, they would join again in 1947. They first won in 1954, sharing the championship with both England and Wales. France shared with Wales again the next season, but won it alone for the first time in 1959. France's longest wait for a championship spanned 37 tournaments (1910 to 1954).

{{Six Nations wins}}

===World Cup===
France have competed at every [[Rugby World Cup]] since the competitions inception in 1987. They have also made it to at least the quarter final stages of every tournament. France have figured in the semi-finals and have twice been overall runners-up. They featured in the inaugural final against the All Blacks, which they lost 29-9. France were knocked out by England in the quarter-finals of the 1991 competition - where some games were also held around France with the final in London.

In 1995 France finished third overall, defeating England 19-9 in the third/fourth place play-off. [[Thierry Lacroix]] was also the tournaments top point scorer. Like 1991, for the 1999 competition, some games were played in France, and the team made it to the final but were defeated by Australia. In 2003 they finished fourth; losing the third/fourth place game to the All Blacks. [[Frédéric Michalak]] was the tournaments second highest point scorer and [[Christophe Dominici]] was in the top ten try scorers.

===Overall===
Their Test match record against all nations, updated to [[29 March]] 2007, is as follows:<ref name="RugbyDataOverall">{{cite web| url=http://www.rugbydata.com/france/teamsplayed |title=International Teams > France > Teams Played |publisher=rugbydata.com |accessdate=2007-03-29 |date=[[2007-03-17]]}}</ref>
