'''John Henry Cound Brunt''' (VC, [[Military Cross|MC]]) ([[6 December]] [[1922]]-[[10 December]] [[1944]]) was an [[England|English]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces.

==Details==

He was 22 years old, and a Temporary [[Captain]] in the [[The Sherwood Foresters (The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment)]], [[British Army]], attached to  6th Battalion, The [[Lincolnshire Regiment]] during the [[Second World War]] when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On [[9 December]] [[1944]] near [[Faenza]], [[Italy]], the house around which Captain Brunt's platoon was dug in, was destroyed by intense mortar fire. The captain, rallying his remaining men and moving to an alternative position, continued to hold the enemy although heavily outnumbered. Personally firing a [[Bren]] gun he killed about 14 and then, his ammunition exhausted, he fired a [[PIAT]] and [[2-inch mortar]] left by casualties. This aggressive defence enabled him to re-occupy his previous position and to get his wounded away. Later he showed similar aggressive and inspiring leadership which caused the final withdrawal of the enemy.

He was killed in action, near [[Faenza]], [[Italy]], on [[10 December]] [[1944]].

After the war, the Kent Arms public house in [[Paddock Wood]], Kent, was named the John Brunt, VC in his honour. The New Inn at Fowle Hall then took the name of the Kent Arms.
