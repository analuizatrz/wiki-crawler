The '''Exiles''' are a group of [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]]es created by writer [[Judd Winick]] and artist Mike McKone. The team consists of characters from different dimensions, or realities, which have been removed from time and space in order to correct problems (often called “hiccups") in various alternate worlds and divergent timelines in the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]]. The team usually is made up of six members and each time a member is killed or returned to his or her home reality, a new member is introduced and joins the team. The Exiles were originally given missions by the [[Timebroker]], through a wrist-worn communication device called the Tallus.

== Plot ==
The original Exiles team consists of [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] (Clarice Ferguson, from the [[Age of Apocalypse]] continuity), [[Mimic (comics)#Exiles|Mimic]] (Calvin Rankin), [[Magnus (comics)|Magnus]] (son of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]), [[Thunderbird (comics)#Exiles|Thunderbird]] (John Proudstar), [[Nocturne (comics)|Nocturne]] (Talia Josephine "T.J." Wagner, daughter of [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Scarlet Witch]]) and [[Morph (comics)|Morph]].

[[IMAGE:XMEN 05252005 0024.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Exiles #1. Art by Mike McKone.]]

When Magnus dies (''Exiles'' #2), he is replaced by [[Sunfire (Exiles)|Sunfire]] (Mariko Yashida). [[Heather Hudson (Exiles)|Sasquatch]] (Heather Hudson) arrives when Thunderbird becomes comatose during a battle with the world-eating [[Galactus]] (''Exiles'' #10).

In ''Exiles'' #12, the Exiles discover there is a second team conscripted by the [[Timebroker]], [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]], whose missions typically involve killing or maiming innocents and heroes. The two teams join forces to rescue a group of children from a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] prison camp. However, the teams are told the second stage of the mission is to kill one of the children - David Richards (son of [[Rachel Summers]] and [[Franklin Richards]]) - who will apparently grow up to become a powerful supervillain. Weapon X are willing to kill him, but the Exiles are not and the two teams fight until the Timebroker intervenes. Sabretooth (of the Weapon X team) agrees to stay behind and raise David Richards himself.

The [[Timebroker]] sends Blink home after a visit to a world plagued by a variant of the [[Legacy Virus]], since the team had repaired her personal broken chain in time (''Exiles'' #22) and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] (Illyana Rasputin) takes her place. Mimic then replaces Blink as leader, gaining the Tallus.

During ''Exiles'' #28-30, the Exiles arrive in the main Marvel Universe timeline, Earth-616, where they meet the [[X-Men]] after [[Havok]]'s cancelled wedding in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #425-426. The Exiles team up with the X-Men against an evil Havok from the ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' universe, who shares a body with the good Havok. After Havok is subdued, the Timebroker arrives to personally eliminate the ''Mutant X'' Havok's consciousness.

After [[Sunfire (Exiles)|Sunfire]] is killed by a [[Brood (comics)|Brood]]-infected [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] (''Exiles'' #37), she is replaced by the Exiles' former teammate [[Blink (comics)|Blink]]. During the next mission (''Exiles'' #43), the Exiles and Weapon X are forced to battle each other until only six remain alive. [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] is killed by Hyperion when she attempts to switch sides and betray the Exiles. Hyperion is eventually defeated by Blink, who teleports his own [[heat vision]] into his back, paralysing him. [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] (of Weapon X) is allowed to deliver the killing blow against Hyperion with Magik's sword, which actually kills them both, leaving five Exiles alive and their mission complete.

The Exiles visit the main Marvel Universe, [[Earth-616]], for a second time in ''Exiles'' #46-48. They are joined by [[Namora]], who replaces Magik, and are instructed to "leave their possessions and earn their wings". Reed Richards deduces this means they are to leave [[Nocturne (comics)|Nocturne]] behind (whose power involves [[possession]]) and have [[Beak (comics)|Beak]] join the Exiles, which is confirmed by the [[Timebroker]].

In ''Exiles'' #53, the team are told by [[Celestial (comics)|The Celestials]] to "beware the Timebreaker, he is not what he seems". After this, the Timebroker's behaviour becomes increasingly strange. [[Heather Hudson (Exiles)|Heather Hudson]] is removed from the team (''Exiles'' #59) without explanation and replaced with former [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]] member [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]. The tallus orders the Exiles to kill [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] and despite their refusal, they are allowed to move onto a new mission (normally a mission ''must'' be completed for the Exiles to move on). Next, the Timebroker replaces Beak with [[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]] (''Exiles'' #60), which they are informed is a punishment for disobeying previous orders.

Eventually, the Exiles break free of the Timebroker and stage a raid on [[Panoptichron]] (also known as the "Crystal Palace"), home of the Timebroker and a location from which many parallel universes can be monitored. Here they discover that the Timebreakers are an alien race of bug-like beings who found the Panoptichron and accidentally broke a series of timelines. Lacking the power to repair the timelines, they concocted this scheme of recruiting heroes from various worlds to do their work for them.  Not only that, all previously "returned" heroes are actually in Panoptichron, frozen in blocks, along with the killed heroes. As a final twist, the evil Hyperion has broken free of his prison and has taken over Panoptichron. The Exiles defeat Hyperion, but at the cost of Namora and Holocaust's lives. Beak returns from stasis and saved the day by calling on two good versions of Hyperion for help, fulfilling his destiny as an Exile. Only Blink, Mimic, Morph, Sabretooth, Beak, and Heather Hudson remain to pick up the pieces.

The Exiles then return to Earth-616 to take Beak home. Unfortunately, Earth-616 is dominated by the [[House of M]]. During their stay, the Exiles run afoul of the body-hopping serial killer [[Proteus (comics)|Proteus]], who steals data from Panoptichron and escapes from reality to reality after the House of M ends, leaving Beak [[Decimation (comics)|depowered]] and back home. The Exiles chase Proteus through several realities, including [[New Universe]], [[2099 (comics)|2099]], [[Squadron Supreme]], [[Hulk (comics)|Future Imperfect]], and [[Heroes Reborn]], before finally bringing Proteus down by trapping him in Morph’s body, which does not decay, unlike all of Proteus’ other host bodies. During the “World Tour” of hunting down Proteus, Mimic is possessed by Proteus and dies, the Exiles create divergent timelines in 2099 and the New Universe, and pick up new members [[Longshot]], [[Spider-Man 2099]], and [[Power Princess]].

The Exiles begin cleaning out the stasis gallery of former Exiles and Weapon X members and send them back home. Iron Man, Daredevil, and Angel are sent back to their respective realities alive, while every other Earth with a missing superhuman holds a funeral. Blink, at the suggestion of Power Princess, takes Mimic home to be buried with his X-Men instead of burying him in Panoptichron. Spider-Man, Sabretooth, and Heather Hudson all decided to visit their home realities. Unfortunately, the Timebreakers ditch the Exiles when the Timebreakers believe that they are not saving realities as they should be. However, after using several squads of Wolverines to complete the next mission and failing, Logan (from [[Days of Future Past]]) and young James Howlett convince the Timebreakers that the Exiles are needed. The Exiles finally resume their reality-saving missions for the first time since they discovered Panoptichron when they save a world being destroyed by the [[Silver Surfer]]. 

Then, Heather discovers an Earth inhabited by a disturbingly close approximation of the original Exiles team, complete with their own Timebroker. After the "classic Exiles" fight "the all-new Exiles" (as Morph put it), it is later revealed that the whole thing was a scheme orchestrated by the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]], who seeks revenge on the Exiles for freeing Professor X on their first mission and ruining a bet. The Exiles, past and present, join forces with the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]] of that Earth to defeat the Grandmaster. The current team then leaves the Earth in the hands of the approximation Exiles. The Exiles then take three weeks to save a chain of cracked realities, injuring Blink, Morph, and Spider-Man 2099. They also discover that Proteus is possibly immune to metal while in Morph’s body. Meanwhile, former Exile, Thunderbird, is in the stasis gallery, dreaming of what might have been had he not become comatose. 

In Exiles #90, [[Power Princess]] quit the Exiles to return to the Squadron Supreme. The Exiles begin to train, and an unknown force is driving the Timebreakers into hiding. Blink, Spider-Man 2099, Longshot, and Sabretooth go to a world about to collapse. Only Sabretooth makes it back, with the others prisoners. At Sabretooth's request, Heather unhinges [[Psylocke]] from Earth-616 to join the Exiles in [[Power Princess]]' place as she might be their only chance if Proteus ever resurfaces. However, upon arrival, she clashes with Sabretooth, thinking him to be the 616 Sabretooth that nearly killed her twice.

==Future==
{{spoiler-solicitation}}
''All information below is based off of images and teasers from [http://www.marvel.com]'s online catalog previews.''
*In ''Exiles'' #91, [[Psylocke]] engages in mortal combat with Sabretooth.
*In ''Exiles'' #92, Psylocke has to free the mind-controlled Exiles from [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and the [[Invisible Woman]] in a Universe ruled over by the Hydra organization.
*In ''Exiles'' #93, [[Psylocke]] goes head-to-head with [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] to kill him while [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] battles [[Slaymaster]].

==Tallus==
The Tallus is a communications device, which is worn by the leader of the group, that was formerly used by the Timebroker to assign each mission. Blink wears the Tallus in the beginning, but it is later transferred to Sabretooth when Blink rebels against the Timebroker (later revealed to be Hyperion). Mimic also wears the Tallus for a time in Blink's absence. It is now used as a means of communication between Heather Hudson and Sabretooth on various missions.

==Trivia==
* Morph is the only member to stay consistent throughout the series, and as of #88, is the only character on the team ''not'' from a previously introduced reality.
* The longest running roster is Mimic, Morph, Nocturne, Sasquatch, Sunfire, and Magik, from Exiles #22 (after Blink's departure) to Exiles #37 (Sunfire's death and Blink's return) - 15 issues.
* Hyperion, Beak, Daredevil, Angel, Iron Man, The Hulk (Jennifer Walters of Weapon X) , and young James Howlett are the only people drafted by the Timebreakers who actually returned home alive.
* Spider-Man 2099 was the first person to voluntarily join the Exiles.
* Power Princess was the first person to voluntarily quit the Exiles.
* Sunfire was the first non-original Exile to die.
* Three people associated with the "main" X-Men have been on the team: Beak, Longshot, and Psylocke.
* The Exiles have only had ten one-issue stories (#7, 11, 16, 17, 49, 58, 59, 83, 84, 89). Everything else is a multi-part story arc.
* The Exiles' visit to the Age of Apocalypse marks the first time the Exiles visit an artificially created divergent timeline, rather than a simple alternate universe.
* Six of the Exiles have died so far: Magnus, Sunfire, Magik, Holocaust, Namora, and Mimic.
* Only four former Exiles are still alive: Thunderbird, Nocturne, Beak, and Power Princess.
* The Exiles' World Tour creates divergent timelines in both the New Universe and 2099.
* Characters who appear to be the X-Men from the ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' series can be seen in a screen in the Panoptichron's control room when Hyperion is explaining (in issue #63) how he survived Weapon X's demise (in issue #45). The appearance of the [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] from [[Marvel Zombies]] in #85 appears to confirm that the [[Earth-616|616]] and [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] universes are located in the same [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]].
* The Earths the members come from are either revealed in Handbooks (characters from previously introduced Earths; Power Princess, Blink, Sabretooth, Holocaust, Beak, and Spider-Man 2099) or in Exiles #83-84.
* The series is notable for the number of characters who not only die but stay dead, in contrast to the [[Comic book death|frequent resurrections]] that occur in the main Marvel and DC continuities. This is presumably because of the possibilities allowed by alternate versions of characters, whose fates are entirely separate to their mainstream counterparts.

==World Tour==
When the Exiles go on a "World Tour" to catch Proteus, they travel to several realities already seen in Marvel history:
*[[House of M]] #69-71
*[[New Universe|New Universe approximation]] #72-74
*[[Marvel 2099|2099 approximation]] #75-76
*[[Squadron Supreme]] #77-78
*[[Hulk (comics)|Future Imperfect]] #79-80
*[[Heroes Reborn]] #81-82

==Weapon X==
First seen in ''Exiles'' #5 as a version of the Exiles that did more ruthless missions. This team had various members and its roster changed more than the Exiles. Weapon X was originally composed of Sabretooth, Kane, Mesmero, Wolverine, Maverick, and Deadpool. The team was destroyed during the "A Blink in time" arc, when the Timebroker wanted to downsize both teams in hopes of killing off the insane Hyperion, who abandoned missions to rule worlds.

==Current Exiles roster==
Whenever one of the Exiles dies, is sent home, or something happens to them, they are replaced by someone else, and thus the roster changes. The first occurrence is when Magnus dies in Exiles #2, and Sunfire comes on board to replace him. The current Exiles roster is:

*[[Blink (comics)|Blink]]
*[[Morph (comics)|Morph]]
*[[Sabretooth (comics)#Age of Apocalypse and the Exiles|Sabretooth]]
*[[Longshot]]
*[[Spider-Man 2099]]
*[[Psylocke]]

||
||Exiles #85
||An android built to destroy Wolverine, Elsie Dee's acolyte.  Killed in the blast when Logan attacked Brother Mutant.

|-
||[[Elsie-Dee|Elsie Dee]] (Earth-50211)

|-
||[[Wolverine (comics)|Weapon X]] (Earth-520)
||James "Logan" Howlett
||Exiles #85

||He has just discovered his powers and thusly has assumed neither Logan's nor Wolverine's identity.  The only Wolverine Exile to return home alive from the team introduced in Exiles #85.

||James "Logan" Howlett
||Uncanny X-Men #141/Exiles #85 (as an Exiles)
||He apparently survived his desmise at the hand of the Sentinels thanks to his healing Factor. He, Marvel Girl III, Hyperstorm and Kate Pryde are the only known survivors from the X-Men in this timeline.  Killed by an energy blast as he nearly killed Brother Mutant.  His death echoes the one featured in the Days of Future Past timeline (although a Sentinel, not another mutant, killed him in that timeline). It is not clear if  this Storyline takes place  before or after events in the Earth X universe. Thus this character may come from a diverent reality.

|-
</TABLE>

The mission of these Wolverine Teams was to eliminate the Brother Mutant, but he(?) captured and hypnotized them. Finally, the last Wolverine Team manages to kill the Brother Mutant, with the help of the First Exiles Team. In the end, 17 Wolverines perished during the fight. James Howlett was the only member sent home.

===Recurring characters===
In ''Exiles'' there has been a number of special heroes, villains and others. Some of them are even significant in more than one reality and/or story.
