<!--Please do not insert titles or descriptions other than his name here.-->'''Sheikh Mujibur Rahman''' ({{lang-bn|শেখ মুজিবুর রহমান}} [[Romanization of Bengali|''Shekh Mujibur Rôhman'']]) (March 17, 1920 – August 15, 1975) was a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] politician and the founding leader of [[Bangladesh]], considered the [[Pater Patriae|father of the nation]]. He headed the [[Awami League]], served as the first [[President of Bangladesh]] and later became its [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh|Prime Minister]]. He is popularly referred to as '''Sheikh Mujib''', and with the honorary title of '''Bangabandhu''' (বঙ্গবন্ধু ''Bôngobondhu'', "Friend of Bengal"). His eldest daughter [[Sheikh Hasina Wajed]] is the present leader of the Awami League and a former prime minister of Bangladesh.

A student political leader, Mujib rose in East Pakistani politics and within the ranks of the Awami League as a charismatic and forceful orator. An advocate of [[socialism]], Mujib became popular for his leadership against the ethnic and institutional discrimination of Bengalis. He demanded increased provincial autonomy, and became a fierce opponent of the military rule of [[Ayub Khan]]. At the heightening of sectional tensions, Mujib outlined a [[six point movement|6-point autonomy plan]], which was seen as separatism in [[West Pakistan]]. He was tried in 1968 for allegedly conspiring with the [[Government of India|Indian government]] but was not found guilty. Despite leading his party to a major victory in the 1970 elections, Mujib was not invited to form the government.

After talks broke down with President [[Yahya Khan]] and West Pakistani politician [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], Mujib was arrested and a [[Bangladesh Liberation War|guerrilla war]] erupted between government forces and Bengali nationalists aided by India. An all out war between the Pakistan Army and Bangladesh-India Joint Forces led to the establishment of Bangladesh, and after his release Mujib assumed office as a provisional president, and later prime minister. Even as a constitution was adopted, proclaiming socialism and a secular democracy, Mujib struggled to address the challenges of intense poverty and unemployment, coupled with rampant corruption. Amidst rising popular agitation, he banned other political parties and declared himself president for life in 1975. After only seven months, Mujib was [[Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman|assassinated]] along with his family by a group of army officers.

==Early life==

Mujib was educated at the Gopalganj Public School and later transferred to the Gopalganj Missionary School, from where he completed his [[matriculation]]. However, Mujib was withdrawn from school in 1934 to undergo eye surgery, and returned to school only after four years, owing to the severity of the surgery and slow recovery. At the age of eighteen, Mujib married Begum Fazilatnnesa. She gave birth to their two daughters — [[Sheikh Hasina]] and Sheikh Rehana — and three sons — [[Sheikh Kamal]], Sheikh Jamal and Sheikh Russel.<ref name="BAL">{{cite web

Mujib became politically active when he joined the [[All India Muslim Students Federation]] in 1940. He enrolled at the [[Maulana Azad College|Islamia College]] (now Maulana Azad College), a well-respected college affiliated to the [[University of Calcutta]] in [[Kolkata]] to study law and entered student politics there. He joined the [[All India Muslim League|Bengal Muslim League]] in 1943 and grew close to the faction led by [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]], a leading Bengali Muslim leader. During this period, Mujib worked actively for the League's cause of a separate [[Islam|Muslim]] state of [[Pakistan]] and in 1946 he was elected general secretary of the Islamia College Students Union. After obtaining his degree in 1947, Mujib was one of the Muslim politicians working under [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy|Suhrawardy]] during the communal violence that broke out in Calcutta, in 1946, just before the [[partition of India]].<ref name="BAL" />

On his return to [[East Bengal]], he enrolled in the [[University of Dhaka]] to study law and founded the [[East Pakistan Muslim Students' League]] and became one of the most prominent student political leaders in the province. During these years, Mujib developed an affinity for [[socialism]] as the ideal solution to mass poverty, unemployment and poor living conditions. On January 26, 1949 the government announced that [[Urdu]] would officially be the [[official language|state language]] of Pakistan. Though still in jail, Mujib encouraged fellow activist groups to launch strikes and protests and undertook a [[hunger strike]] for 13 days. Following the declaration of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] and the province chief minister [[Khwaja Nazimuddin]] in 1948 that the people of [[East Pakistan]], mainly Bengalis, would have to adopt Urdu as the state language, agitation broke out amongst the population. Mujib led the Muslim Students League in organising strikes and protests, and was arrested along with his colleagues by police on March 11.<ref name="BAL" /> The outcry of students and political activists led to the immediate release of Mujib and the others. Mujib was expelled from the university and arrested again in 1949 for attempting to organize the menial and clerical staff in an agitation over workers' rights.<ref name="REF" />

==Early political career==
{{seealso|Bengali Language Movement}}
[[Image:P217.gif|thumb|150px|right|Sheikh Mujib, 1950]]
Mujib launched his political career, leaving the Muslim League to join Suhrawardy and [[Maulana Bhashani]] in the formation of the [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami Muslim League]], the predecessor of the [[Awami League]]. He was elected joint secretary of its East Pakistan unit in 1949. While Suhrawardy worked to build a larger coalition of East Pakistani and socialist parties, Mujib focused on expanding the grassroots organisation. In 1951, Mujib began organising protests and rallies in response to the killings by police of students who had been protesting against the declaration of Urdu as the sole national language. This period of turmoil, later to be known as the [[Bengali Language Movement]], saw Mujib and many other Bengali politicians arrested. In 1953, he was made the party's general secretary, and elected to the [[East Bengal Legislative Assembly]] on a [[United Front (East Pakistan)|United Front]] coalition ticket in 1954. Serving briefly as the minister for [[agriculture]], Mujib was briefly arrested for organizing a protest of the central government's decision to dismiss the United Front ministry. He was elected to the second [[Constituent Assembly of Pakistan]] and served from 1955 to 1958.<ref name="REF" /> During a speech in the assembly on the proposed plan to dissolve the [[Historical regions of Pakistan|provinces]] in favour of an amalgamated West Pakistan and East Pakistan with a powerful central government, Mujib demanded that the Bengali people's ethnic identity be respected and that a popular verdict should decide the question:

<blockquote>"Sir [President of the Constituent Assembly], you will see that they want to place the word "East Pakistan" instead of "East Bengal." We had demanded so many times that you should use Bengal instead of Pakistan. The word "Bengal" has a history, has a tradition of its own. You can change it only after the people have been consulted. So far as the question of one unit is concerned it can come in the constitution. Why do you want it to be taken up just now? What about the state language, [[Bengali language|Bengali]]? We will be prepared to consider one-unit with all these things. So I appeal to my friends on that side to allow the people to give their verdict in any way, in the form of [[referendum]] or in the form of [[plebiscite]]."<ref name="BAL" /></blockquote>

In 1956, Mujib entered a second coalition government as minister of industries, commerce, labour, anti-corruption and village aid, but resigned in 1957 to work full-time for the party organization. When General [[Ayub Khan]] suspended the [[Constitution of Pakistan|constitution]] and imposed [[martial law]] in 1958, Mujib was arrested for organising resistance and imprisoned till 1961.<ref name="REF" /> After his release from prison, Mujib started organising an underground political body called the [[Swadhin Bangal Biplobi Parishad]] (''Free Bangla Revolutionary Council''), comprising student leaders in order to oppose the regime of Ayub Khan and to work for increased political power for Bengalis and the independence of East Pakistan. He was briefly arrested again in 1962 for organising protests.<ref name="BAL" />

Following Suhrawardy's death in 1963, Mujib came to head the Awami League, which became one of the largest political parties in Pakistan.<ref name = "POLY"/> The party had dropped the word "Muslim" from its name in a shift towards [[secularism]] and a broader appeal to non-Muslim communities. Mujib was one of the key leaders to rally opposition to President Ayub Khan's ''Basic Democracies'' plan, the imposition of martial law and the one-unit scheme, which centralized power and merged the provinces.<ref name="JSTOR2">{{cite web

Unrest over continuing denial of democracy spread across Pakistan and Mujib intensified his opposition to the disbandment of provinces. In 1966, Mujib proclaimed a 6-point plan titled ''Our Charter of Survival'' at a national conference of opposition political parties at [[Lahore]],<ref name="REF" /> in which he demanded self-government and considerable political, economic and defence autonomy for East Pakistan in a Pakistani [[federation]] with a weak central government.<ref name="JSTOR2" /> According to his plan: 
<blockquote>
#The constitution should provide for a Federation of Pakistan in its true sense on the [[Lahore Resolution]] and the parliamentary form of government with supremacy of a legislature directly elected on the basis of universal adult franchise.
#The federal government should deal with only two subjects: [[defense (military)|defence]] and [[Foreign relations of Pakistan|foreign affairs]], and all other residuary subjects shall be vested in the federating states.
#Two separate, but freely convertible [[Paisa|currencies]] for two wings should be introduced; or if this is not feasible, there should be one currency for the whole country, but effective constitutional provisions should be introduced to stop the flight of capital from East to West Pakistan. Furthermore, a separate [[bank reserves|banking reserve]] should be established and separate [[fiscal policy|fiscal]] and [[monetary policy]] be adopted for East Pakistan.
#The power of [[tax]]ation and revenue collection shall be vested in the federating units and the federal centre will have no such power. The federation will be entitled to a share in the state taxes to meet its expenditures.
#There should be two separate accounts for the [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] earnings of the two wings; the foreign exchange requirements of the federal government should be met by the two wings equally or in a ratio to be fixed; indigenous products should move free of [[duty (economics)|duty]] between the two wings, and the constitution should empower the units to establish trade links with foreign countries.
#East Pakistan should have a separate militia or paramilitary forces.</blockquote>

[[Image:Mujib54.gif|thumb|right|200px|Mujib in 1954]]

Mujib's points catalysed public support across East Pakistan, launching what some historians have termed the ''[[six point movement|6 point movement]]'' — recognized as the definitive gambit for autonomy and rights of Bengalis in Pakistan. Mujib obtained the broad support of Bengalis, including the [[Hinduism in Pakistan|Hindu]] and other religious communities in East Pakistan. However, his demands were considered radical in West Pakistan and interpreted as thinly-veiled [[separatism]]. The proposals alienated West Pakistani people and politicians, as well as non-Bengalis and Muslim fundamentalists in East Pakistan.

Mujib was arrested by the army and after two years in jail, an official sedition trial in a military court opened. Widely known as the [[Agartala Conspiracy Case]], Mujib and 34 Bengali military officers were accused by the government of colluding with Indian government agents in a scheme to divide Pakistan and threaten its unity, order and national security. The plot was alleged to have been planned in the city of [[Agartala]], in the Indian state of [[Tripura]].<ref name="REF" /> The outcry and unrest over Mujib's arrest and the charge of sedition against him destabilised East Pakistan amidst large protests and strikes. Various Bengali political and student groups added demands to address the issues of students, workers and the poor, forming a larger "11-point plan." The government caved to the mounting pressure, dropped the charged and unconditionally released Mujib. He returned to East Pakistan as a public hero.

Joining an all-parties conference convened by Ayub Khan in 1969, Mujib demanded the acceptance of his six points and the demands of other political parties and walked out following its rejection. On December 5, 1969 Mujib made a declaration at a public meeting held to observe the death anniversary of Suhrawardy that henceforth East Pakistan would be called "Bangladesh":

<blockquote>"There was a time when all efforts were made to erase the word "Bangla" from this land and its map. The existence of the word "Bangla" was found nowhere except in the term [[Bay of Bengal]]. I on behalf of Pakistan announce today that this land will be called "Bangladesh" instead of East Pakistan."<ref name="BAL" /></blockquote>

Mujib's declaration heightened tensions across the country. The West Pakistani politicians and the military began to see him as a separatist leader. His assertion of Bengali cultural and ethnic identity also re-defined the debate over regional autonomy. Many scholars and observers believed the Bengali agitation emphasized the rejection of the ''[[Two-Nation Theory]]'' — the case upon which Pakistan had been created — by asserting the ethno-cultural identity of Bengalis as a nation.<ref name="GPSA">{{cite web

It was following his 6-point plan that Mujib was increasingly referred to by his supporters as "Bangabandhu" (literally meaning ''"Friend of Bengal"'' in [[Bengali language|Bengali]]).

==1970 elections and independence==
[[Image:P015.gif|200px|thumb|right|Sheikh Mujib with [[Maulana Bhashani]] in a protest march]]
A [[1970 Bhola cyclone|major coastal cyclone]] struck East Pakistan in 1970, leaving hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced. The subsequent period exposed extreme outrage and unrest over the perceived weak and ineffective response of the central government. Public opinion and political parties in East Pakistan blamed the governing authorities as intentionally negligent. The West Pakistani politicians attacked the Awami League for allegedly using the crisis for political gain. The dissatisfaction led to divisions within the civil services, police and military of Pakistan. In the [[Pakistani general election, 1970|elections held]] in December 1970, the Awami League under Mujib's leadership won a massive majority in the provincial legislature, and all but 2 of East Pakistan's quota of seats in the new [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]], thus forming a clear majority.<ref name="REF" />

The election result revealed a polarisation between the two wings of Pakistan, with the largest and most successful party in the West being the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] of [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], who was completely opposed to Mujib's demand for greater autonomy. Bhutto threatened to boycott the assembly and oppose the government if Mujib was invited by [[Yahya Khan]] (then president of Pakistan) to form the next government, demanding his party's inclusion. There was also widespread opposition in the Pakistani military and the Islamic political parties to Mujib becoming Pakistan's prime minister. And even though neither Mujib nor the League had explicitly advocated political independence for East Pakistan, smaller nationalist groups were demanding independence for ''Bangladesh''.

Following political deadlock, Yahya Khan delayed the convening of the assembly — a move seen by Bengalis as a plan to deny Mujib's party, which formed a majority, from taking charge.<ref name="POLY">{{cite web

<blockquote>"The struggle now is the struggle for our emancipation; the struggle now is the struggle for our independence. Joy Bangla!..Since we have given blood, we will give more blood. God-willing, the people of this country will be liberated...Turn every house into a fort. Face (the enemy) with whatever you have."</blockquote>

Following a last ditch attempt to foster agreement, Yahya Khan declared martial law, banned the Awami League and ordered the army to arrest Mujib and other Bengali leaders and activists. The army launched [[Operation Searchlight]] to curb the political and civil unrest, fighting the nationalist militias that were believed to have received training in India. Speaking on radio even as the army began its crackdown, Mujib declared Bangladesh's independence at midnight on March 26, 1971:<ref name="TIME-1971-04-05">{{cite news

Mujib was arrested and moved to West Pakistan and kept under heavy guard in a jail near [[Faisalabad]] (then Lyallpur).

==Governing Bangladesh==
[[Image:Mujib7March.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Historic speech of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on March 7, 1971]]
Mujibur Rahman briefly assumed the provisional presidency and later took office as the prime minister, heading all organs of government and decision-making. In doing so, he dismissed Tajuddin Ahmad following a controversial intra-party power struggle that had occurred during Mujib's incarceration. The politicians elected in 1970 formed the provisional [[Jatiyo Sangshad|parliament]] of the new state. The Mukti Bahini and other militias amalgamated to form a new [[Bangladesh Army|Bangladeshi army]] to which Indian forces transferred control on March 17.<ref name="BAL" /> Mujib described the fallout of the war as the "biggest human disaster in the world," claiming the deaths of as many as 3 million people and the [[rape]] of more than 200,000 women. The government faced serious challenges, which including the rehabilitation of millions of people displaced in 1971, organising the supply of food, health aids and other necessities. The effects of the 1970 cyclone had not worn off, and the state's [[Economy of Bangladesh|economy]] had immensely deteriorated by the conflict. There was also violence against non-Bengalis and groups who were believed to have assisted the Pakistani forces. By the end of the year, thousands of Bengalis arrived from Pakistan, and thousands of non-Bengalis migrated to Pakistan; and yet many thousands remained in [[refugee camp]]s.

After Bangladesh achieved recognition from major countries, Mujib helped Bangladesh enter into the [[United Nations]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. He travelled to the United States, the United Kingdom and other European nations to obtain humanitarian and developmental assistance for the nation.<ref name="BAL" /> He signed a treaty of friendship with India, which pledged extensive economic and humanitarian assistance and began training Bangladesh's security forces and government personnel.<ref>{{cite book

Mujib's government soon began encountering increased dissatisfaction and unrest. His programmes of nationalisation and industrial socialism suffered from lack of trained personnel, inefficiency, rampant corruption and poor leadership.<ref name="UDDIN" /> Mujib focused almost entirely on national issues and thus neglected local issues and government. The party and central government exercised full control and democracy was weakened, with virtually no elections organised at the grass roots or local levels.<ref name="PAPER">{{cite web

Mujib was criticized for [[nepotism]] in appointing family members to important positions.<ref name = "KF"/> A famine in 1974 further intensified the food crisis, and devastated agriculture — the mainstay of the economy.<ref name="REF" /> Intense criticism of Mujib arose over lack of political leadership, a flawed pricing policy, and rising [[inflation]] amidst heavy losses suffered by the nationalised industries. Mujib's ambitious social programmes performed poorly, owing to scarcity of resources, funds and personnel, and caused unrest amongst the masses.<ref name="UDDIN" />

Political unrest gave rise to increasing violence, and in response, Mujib began increasing his powers. On January 25, 1975 Mujib declared a [[state of emergency]] and his political supporters approved a constitutional amendment banning all opposition political parties. Mujib was declared "president for life," and given extraordinary powers.<ref name="JSTOR">Maniruzzaman, Talukder, "Bangladesh in 1975: The Fall of the Mujib Regime and Its Aftermath," Asian Survey, 16, No. 2, February 1976,  119–29. </ref><ref name = "KF"/> His political supporters amalgamated to form the only legalised political party, the [[BAKSAL|Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League]], commonly known by its initials — BAKSAL.<ref name="REF" /> The party identified itself with the rural masses, farmers and labourers and took control of government machinery. It also launched major socialist programmes. Using government forces and a militia of supporters called the [[Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini]], Mujib oversaw the arrest of opposition activists and strict control of political activities across the country.<ref name="JSTOR" /><ref name="US">{{cite web

While retaining support from many segments of the population, Mujib evoked anger amongst veterans of the liberation war for what was seen as a betrayal of the causes of democracy and [[civil rights]].<ref name = "KF"/> The underground opposition to Mujib's political regime intensified under the clout of dissatisfaction and the government's inability to deal with national challenges and the dissatisfaction within the Bangladeshi army.

==Assassination==

[[Image:P193.gif|thumb|100px|right|Mujib was assassinated on August 15, 1975.]]
On August 15, 1975, a group of junior army officers invaded the presidential residence with [[tank]]s and killed Mujib, his family and the personal staff.<ref name="REF" /><ref name = "KF"/> Only his daughters [[Sheikh Hasina Wajed]] and Sheikh Rehana, who were on a visit to [[West Germany]], were left alive.

Mujib's death plunged the nation into many years of political turmoil. The ''coup'' leaders were soon overthrown and a series of counter-''coups'' and political assassinations paralysed the country.<ref name="JSTOR" /> Order was largely restored after a ''coup'' in 1977 gave control to the army chief [[Ziaur Rahman]]. Declaring himself President in 1978, Ziaur Rahman signed the [[Indemnity Act|Indemnity Ordinance]], giving immunity from prosecution to the men who plotted Mujib's assassination and overthrow. Ziaur Rahman and [[Hossain Mohammad Ershad]] reversed the state's commitment to secularism and socialism, as well as most of Mujibur Rahman's signature policies.

In exile, Sheikh Hasina became the leader of the Awami League. She returned to Bangladesh on May 17, 1981 and led popular opposition to the military regime of President Ershad. In the elections following the restoration of democracy in 1991, Sheikh Hasina became the leader of the opposition and in 1996, she won the elections to become Bangladesh's prime minister. Revoking the Indemnity Ordinance, an official murder case was lodged and an investigation launched. One of the main ''coup'' leaders, Colonel [[Syed Faruque Rahman]] was arrested along with 14 other army officers, while others fled abroad.<ref name="REF" /><ref name = "Trial"/> Sheikh Hasina lost power in the [[Bangladeshi parliamentary election, 2001|2001 elections]], but remained the opposition leader and one of the most important politicians in Bangladesh.

==Criticism and legacy==
[[Image:Bangabandhu Square Monument.A.M.R.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Bangabandhu Square Monument]]
The Pakistani leadership in 1971 was considered by some observers and governments to be fighting to keep the country united in face of violent secessionist activities led by Mujib. Indian support for the Mukti Bahini dented the credibility of Mujib and the League in the community of nations.<ref name="BNS">{{cite web

Several historians regard Mujib as a rabble-rousing, charismatic leader who galvanised the nationalist struggle but proved inept in governing the country.<ref name="JSTOR" /> During his tenure as Bangladesh's leader, Muslim religious leaders and politicians intensely criticized Mujib's adoption of state secularism. He alienated some segments of nationalists and the military, who feared Bangladesh would come to depend upon India and become a [[satellite state]] by taking extensive aid from the Indian government and allying Bangladesh with India on many foreign and regional affairs.<ref name="JSTOR3">{{cite web

Following his death, succeeding governments offered low-key commemorations of Mujib, and his public image was restored only with the election of an Awami League government led by his daughter Sheikh Hasina in 1996. August 15 is commemorated as "National Mourning Day," mainly by Awami League supporters.<ref name="BAL" /> He remains the paramount icon of the Awami League, which continues to profess Mujib's ideals of socialism. Mujib is widely admired by scholars and in Bengali communities in India and across the world for denouncing the military rule and ethnic discrimination that existed in Pakistan, and for leading the Bengali struggle for rights and liberty.<ref name="Trial">{{cite web

In a 2004 poll conducted on the worldwide listeners of [[BBC]]'s Bengali radio service, Mujib was voted the "Greatest Bengali of All Time" beating out [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and others.<ref>Listeners name 'greatest Bengali'.
