'''Aphids''', also known as '''plant lice''',<ref>Not to be confused with "[[Jumping plant louse|jumping plant lice]]"</ref> are small plant-eating [[insect]]s, and members of the [[Taxonomic rank|superfamily]] '''Aphidoidea'''.<ref>Aphids are also sometimes known as blackflies and greenflies (page 86 of ''Bugs of the World'', George C. McGavin, [http://factsonfile.com Facts on File], 1993)</ref>  Aphids are among the most destructive insect pests on [[Earth]].<ref name=mcgavin>''Bugs of the World'', George C. McGavin, [http://factsonfile.com Facts on File], 1993, ISBN 0816027374</ref>

About 4,400 species of 10 families are known. Historically, many fewer families were recognized, as most species were included in the family [[Aphididae]]. Around 250 species are serious pests for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] as well as an annoyance for [[gardener]]s. They vary in length from one to ten [[millimetre]]s. 

Natural enemies include predatory [[Coccinellidae|lady beetles]] ([[Coleoptera]]: [[Coccinellidae]]), [[flower-fly|hoverfly larvae]] ([[Diptera]]: [[Syrphidae]]), [[parasitic wasp]]s, [[Aphidoletes aphidimyza|aphid midge larvae]], [[aphid lion]]s,  [[crab spiders]]<ref>[http://www.eeb.cornell.edu/agrawal/slide%20presentations/diversity/pages/milkweed%20spider%20aphid.html Photo] of [[crab spider]] eating Aphis asclepiadis aphids on common [[milkweed]], Anurag Agrawal, Phytophagy Laboratory, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Department of Entomology at [[Cornell University]].</ref>  lacewings ([[Neuroptera]]: [[Chrysopidae]]), and [[entomopathogenic fungus|entomopathogenic fungi]] like ''Lecanicillium lecanii'' and the [[Entomophthorales]]. 

Aphids are distributed worldwide, but are most common in [[temperate zone]]s. Also, in contrast to many taxa, species diversity is much lower in the tropics than in the temperate zones. They can migrate great distances, mainly through passive dispersal by riding on winds. For example, the [[currant lettuce]] aphid (''Nasonovia ribisnigri Mosley'') is believed to have spread from [[New Zealand]] to [[Tasmania]] in this way.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2005/s1493620.htm ''Scientist battles lettuce aphid''], Pip Courtney, Landline, [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], October 30, 2005, ''Retrieved 1 January 2007''</ref>    Aphids have also been spread by human transportation of infested plant materials.

== Taxonomy ==
Aphids are in the [[superfamily]] Aphidoidea in the homopterous division of the order [[Hemiptera]]. Recent classification within Hemiptera has reduced the old taxon "Homoptera" to two suborders: [[Sternorrhyncha]] (e.g., aphids, [[Whitefly|whiteflies]], [[scale insect|scales]], [[Psylloidea|psyllids]], etc.) and [[Auchenorrhyncha]] (e.g., [[cicadas]], [[leafhoppers]], [[treehopper]]s, [[planthopper]]s, etc.) with the suborder [[Heteroptera]] containing a large group of insects known as the [[true bugs]]. More recent reclassifications have substantially rearranged the families within Aphidoidea: some old families were reduced to subfamily rank (e.g., [[Eriosomatidae]]), and many old subfamilies elevated to family rank. Furthermore, [[woolly conifer aphids]] like the pine aphid, the spruce aphid and the balsam woolly aphid are not aphids, but [[adelgid]]s.

=== Relation to phylloxera and adelgids ===
Aphids, [[adelgid]]s, and [[phylloxera|phylloxerids]] are very closely related, and are either placed in the insect super family ''Aphidoidea'' (Blackman and Eastop, 1994) or into two super families (''Phylloxeroidea'' and  ''Aphidoidea'') within the order ''[[Homoptera]]'', the plant-sucking bugs.<ref name=Dixon>''Aphid Ecology - An optimization approach, Second Edition'',  A.F.G. Dixon, Springer; 2nd ed. edition (1997),  ISBN 0412741806</ref>  

Like aphids, phylloxera feed on the roots, leaves and shoots of grape plants, but unlike aphids do not produce [[honeydew]] or [[cornicle]] secretions.<ref>[http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ento.46.1.387?journalCode=ento ''Biology and Management of Grape Phylloxera''], Jeffrey Granett, M. Andrew Walker,­Laszlo Kocsis, and Amir D. Omer, Annual Review of Entomology, Vol. 46: 387-412, January 2001, doi 10.1146/annurev.ento.46.1.387</ref> Phylloxera (''Daktulosphaira vitifoliae''), are insects which caused the [[Great French Wine Blight]] and a plague that devastated European [[viticulture]] in the 19th century. 

Similarly, adelgids also feed on plant phloem. Adelgids are sometimes described as aphids, but more properly as classified as aphid-like insects, because they have no [[cauda (disambiguation)|cauda]] or [[cornicle]]s.<ref name=mcgavin/>

== Anatomy ==
[[Image:Snodgrass Aphis pomi.jpg|thumb|The life stages of the green apple aphid (''Aphis pomi'')]]

Most aphids have soft, green bodies, but other colors are common, such as black, brown, and pink. Aphids have antennas with as many as six segments.<ref name=mcgavin/> Aphids feed themselves through sucking mouthparts called [[stylet]]s, enclosed in a sheath called a [[Rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]], which is formed from modifications of the [[mandible]] and [[maxilla]].<ref name=Stroyan>''Aphid'', Henry G. Stroyan, [[McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology]], 8th Edition, 1997, ISBN 0-07-911504-7</ref> They have long, thin legs and two-jointed, two-clawed [[Arthropod leg|tarsi]].

Most aphids have a pair of [[cornicle]]s (or "siphunculi"), abdominal tubes through which they exude droplets of a quick-hardening defensive fluid<ref name=Stroyan/> containing [[triacylglycerol]]s, called ''cornicle wax''. Other defensive compounds can also be produced by some types of aphids.<ref name=mcgavin/>

Aphids have a tail-like protrustion called a "[[Cauda (disambiguation)|cauda]]" above their rectal apertures. They have two [[compound eye]]s, and an ocular tubercle behind and above each eye, made up of three lenses (called triommatidia).<ref>[http://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/bitstream/2097/154/1/NavdeepMutti2006.pdf ''Molecular Studies of the Salivary Glands of the Pea Aphid, Acyrthosiphon Pisum (Harris)''], Navdeep S. Mutti, PhD Thesis, [[Kansas State University]], 2006.</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=3GHhGJC9z9EC&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=triommatidium+aphid&source=web&ots=iqPFzZ5Chc&sig=T0rPmpGCuFVf8EdXJzV_w1UEhS8&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=2&ct=result#PPP8,M1 ''Aphid Ecology''], A. F. G. Dixon, Chapman and Hall, 1998, ISBN 0412741806</ref> 

When host plant quality becomes poor or conditions become crowded, some aphid species produce winged offspring, "[[alate]]s", that can disperse to other food sources. The mouthparts or eyes are smaller or missing in some species and forms.<ref name=mcgavin/>

== Diet ==

Many aphid species are monophagous (that is, they feed on only one plant species). Others, like the green peach aphid (''Myzus persicae''), feed on hundreds of plant species across many families.

Aphids passively feed on [[sap]] of [[phloem]] vessels in plants, as do many of their fellow members of Hemiptera such as [[scale insect]]s and [[cicada]]s. Once a phloem vessel is punctured, the sap, which is under high pressure, is forced into the aphid's food canal. As they feed, aphids often transmit [[plant viruses]] to the plants, such as to [[potato]]es, [[cereal]]s, [[sugarbeet]]s and [[citrus|citrus plants]].<ref name=Stroyan/> These viruses can sometimes kill the plants.

Plants contain low densities of the [[nitrogen]] compounds needed for building [[protein]]s.  This requires aphids to consume an excess of sap to satisfy their nutritional requirements. The excess is expelled as "[[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]]", out of the [[anus|recta]] of aphids, in such large volumes that in sometimes it can "fall like rain".<ref name=mcgavin/> Aphid honeydew is rich in [[carbohydrate]]s, like the phloem it derives from.

== Symbioses ==

[[Image:Ant cultivating aphids.jpg|left|thumb|Ant tending aphids]]
Some species of [[ant]]s "farm" aphids, protecting them on the plants they eat, and eating the honeydew that the aphids release from the [[Rectum|terminations]] of their [[Gastrointestinal tract|alimentary canals]]. This is a "[[mutualism|mutualistic relationship]]".  

These "dairying ants" "milk" the aphids by stroking them with their [[antenna (biology)|antennae]].<ref>There are also dairying ants that "milk" [[mealybug]]s and other insects.</ref><ref name=Hooper>''Ant'', Linda M. Hooper-Bui, [[World Book Encyclopedia]], 2008, ISBN 978-0-7166-0108-1</ref> Therefore, sometimes aphids are called "ant cows". 

Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly-hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying  ants (such as the European [[yellow meadow ant]], ''Lasius flavus'')<ref name=wootton>''Insects of the World'', Anthony Wootton, Blandford, Cassell Plc, 1984, reprinted 1999, ISBN 0713723661</ref> manage large "herds" of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens that are leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators.<ref name=Hooper/>

An interesting variation in ant-aphid relationships involves [[Lycaenid butterflies]] (such as the Sievers blue butterfly and the Japanese copper butterfly) and the [[Myrmica]] ants. For example, ''Niphanda fusca'' butterflies lay eggs on plants where ants tend herds of aphids. The eggs hatch as [[caterpillar]]s which feed on the aphids. The ants do not defend the aphids from the caterpillars, but carry the caterpillars to their nest. In the nest, the ants feed the caterpillars, which produce honeydew for the ants. When the caterpillars reach full size, they crawl to the colony entrance and form [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]]s. After two weeks, butterflies emerge and take flight.<ref>pages 78 and 79 of ''Insects and Spiders'', Time-Life Books, ISBN 0809496879</ref>

Some [[bee]]s in [[coniferous forest]]s also collect aphid honeydew to make "[[Honey#Honeydew_honey|forest honey]]".<ref name=Stroyan/>

Many aphids are host to [[endosymbiont]] [[bacteria]], ''[[Buchnera (proteobacteria)|Buchnera]]'', inside specialized cells called [[bacteriocyte]]s. These bacteria synthesize some essential [[amino acid]]s that are absent from the phloem that the aphids eat.<ref>{{cite journal | last =Douglas | first =A E | title =Nutritional interactions in insect-microbial symbioses: Aphids and their symbiotic bacteria ''Buchnera'' | journal =Annual Review of Entomology | volume =43 | pages =17[][]8 | date =1998 | id =ISSN 00664170 | accessdate =2007-05-16 | doi =10.1146/annurev.ento.43.1.17}}</ref>

== Reproduction ==
[[Image:Aphid-giving-birth.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Aphid giving birth to live young]]

Some aphid species have unusual and complex reproductive adaptations, while others have fairly simple reproduction. Adaptations include having both [[Sexual reproduction|sexual]] and [[asexual reproduction]], creation of [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s or live [[Nymph (biology)|nymph]]s and switches between [[Woody plant|woody]] and [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] types of host plant at different times of the year.<ref name=mcgavin/><ref>About 10% of aphid species produce generations that alternate between [[Woody plant|woody]] and [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] plants (page 87 of ''Bugs of the World'', George C. McGavin, [http://factsonfile.com Facts on File], 1993).</ref>

Many aphids undergo [[cyclical parthenogenesis]].  In the spring and summer, mostly or only females are present in the population. The overwintering eggs that hatch in the spring result in females, called ''[[fundatrices]]''.  Reproduction is typically [[parthenogenetic]] and [[viviparous]].  Females undergo a modified [[meiosis]] that results in eggs that are genetically identical to their mother (parthenogenetic).  The embryos develop within the mothers' [[ovarioles]], which then give live birth to first [[instar]] female [[nymph]]s (viviparous). The offspring resemble their parent in every way except size, and are called ''[[virginoparae]]''.

This process iterates throughout the summer, producing multiple generations that typically live 20 to 40 days. Thus one female hatched in spring may produce many billions of descendants. For example, some species of cabbage aphids (like ''[[Brevicoryne brassicae]]'') can produce up to 41 generations of females, or more than 1.5 x 10<sup>27</sup> offspring if they all live.

In [[autumn]], aphids undergo sexual, oviparous reproduction. A change in [[photoperiod]] and [[temperature]], or perhaps a lower food quantity or quality, causes females to parthenogenetically produce sexual females and males.  The males are genetically identical to their mothers except that they have one less [[sex chromosome]]. These sexual aphids may lack wings or even mouthparts.<ref name=mcgavin/> Sexual females and males mate, and females lay eggs that develop outside the mother. The eggs endure the winter and emerge as winged or wingless females the following spring.  This is, for example, the life cycle of the rose aphid (''[[Aphis rosae]]''), which may be considered typical of the family. However in warm environments, such as a in the [[tropic]]s or in a [[glasshouse]] or [[greenhouse]], aphids may go on reproducing asexually for many years.<ref name=Stroyan/>

Some species produce winged females in the summer, sometimes in response to low food quality or quantity.  The winged females migrate to start new colonies on a new plant, often of quite a different kind. For example, the [[apple aphid]] (''Aphis mali''), after producing many generations of [[apterous]] females on its typical food-plant, gives rise to winged forms which fly away and settle on grass or corn-stalks.

Some aphids have [[telescoping generations]]. That is, the parthenogenetic, viviparous female has a daughter within her, who is already parthenogenetically producing her own daughter. Thus a female's diet can affect the body size and birth rate of more than one generation (daughters and granddaughters).<ref>Effect of nitrogen fertilization on ''Aphis gossypii'' (Homoptera: Aphididae): variation in size, color, and reproduction, E. Nevo and M. Coll, J. Econ.

== Evolution ==
Aphids probably appeared around 280 million years ago, in the early [[Permian]] period. They probably fed on plants like [[Cordaitales]] or [[Cycadophyta]]. The oldest known aphid [[fossil]] is of the species ''[[Triassoaphis cubitus Evans]]'' from the [[Triassic]].<ref>[http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~herbers/Johnson/PDF%20Pubs/Johnson_etal_Novitates_2001.pdf ''Acropyga and Azteca Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) with Scale Insects (Sternorrhyncha: Coccoidea): 20 Million Years of Intimate Symbiosis''], Christine Johnson, Dant Agosti, Jacques H. Delabie, Klaus Dumpert, D.J. Williams, Michael von Tschirnhaus and Ulrich Maschwitz, American Museum Novitates, June 22, 2001.</ref> The number of species was small, but increased considerably with the appearance of [[angiosperm]]s 160 million years ago. Angiosperms allowed aphids to specialize. Organs like the [[cornicle]]s did not appear until the [[Cretaceous]] period.

== Threats ==
Aphids are soft-bodied, and have a wide variety of insect predators. Aphids also are often infected by [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es and [[fungus|fungi]]. Aphids are affected by the weather, such as [[precipitation]],<ref name=brust/> [[temperature]]<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/1933502  ''Some Effects of Fluctuating Temperatures on Metabolism, Development, and Rate of Population Growth in the Cabbage Aphid, Brevicoryne Brassicae''], K.

[[Image:Aphid-attack.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Lady beetle]] [[larva]] consuming an aphid]]

Insects that attack aphids include predatory [[Coccinellidae|lady beetles]] ([[Coleoptera]]: [[Coccinellidae]]), [[flower-fly|hoverfly larvae]] ([[Diptera]]: [[Syrphidae]]), [[parasitic wasp]]s, [[Aphidoletes aphidimyza|aphid midge larvae]], [[aphid lion]]s, [[crab spiders]]<ref>[http://www.eeb.cornell.edu/agrawal/slide%20presentations/diversity/pages/milkweed%20spider%20aphid.html Photo] of [[crab spider]] eating Aphis asclepiadis aphids on common [[milkweed]], Anurag Agrawal, Phytophagy Laboratory, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Department of Entomology at [[Cornell University]].</ref> and lacewings ([[Neuroptera]]: [[Chrysopidae]]).

Fungi that attack aphids include ''[[Neozygites fresenii]]'', ''[[Entomophthora]]'', ''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'', ''[[Metarhizium anisopliae]]'' and [[entomopathogenic fungus|entomopathogenic fungi]] like ''[[Lecanicillium lecanii]]''.  Aphids brush against the spores, which are typically about 1/4 inch long. These spores stick to the aphid, germinate and penetrate the aphid's skin. The fungus grows in the aphid [[hemolymph]] (i.e., the counterpart of [[blood]] for aphids). After about 3 days, the aphid dies and the fungus releases more spores into the air. Infected aphids are covered with a woolly mass that progressively grows thicker until the aphid is obscured. Often the visible fungus is not the type of fungus that killed the aphid, but a secondary fungus.<ref name=brust/>

Aphids can be easily killed by unfavorable weather, such as late [[Spring (season)|spring]] freezes.<ref>[http://extension.entm.purdue.edu/pestcrop/2007/issue7/index.html ''Soybean Aphid, A New Beginning for 2007''], Christian Krupke, John Obermeyer, and Robert O[][]eil, Pest and Crop, May 11, 2007 - Issue 7, [[Purdue University|Purdue]] Extension Service.</ref> Excessive heat kills the [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] [[bacteria]] that some aphids depend on, which makes the aphids infertile.<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070419172046.htm ''Why Some Aphids Can't Stand The Heat''], [[Science Daily]], April 23, 2007.</ref> Rain prevents winged aphids from dispersing, and knocks aphids off plants and thus kills them from the impact or by starvation.<ref name=brust>[http://www.agnr.umd.edu/news/article.cfm?id=fc71009b80085a8f0183e98449204c95 ''Early Season Aphid and Thrips Populations''], Gerald E.

== Defenses ==

[[Image:P-14 lady beetle.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A "P-14" [[lady beetle]] consuming an aphid<ref>The fourteen-spotted lady beetles are also known as "P-14 lady beetles", or  ''propylea quatuordecimpunctata''.</ref>]]
[[Image:Aphid-sap2.jpg|right|thumb|150px| Aphid excreting defensive fluid from the [[cornicle]]s.]]

Aphids are soft-bodied, and have little protection from predators and diseases. Some species of aphid interact with plant tissues forming a [[gall]], an abnormal swelling of plant tissue. Aphids can live inside the gall, which provides protection from predators and the elements. A number of galling aphid species are known to produce specialised "soldier" forms, sterile nymphs with defensive features which defend the gall from invasion.<ref>Aoki, S. (1977) Colophina clematis (Homoptera, Pemphigidae), an aphid species with soldiers. Kontyu 45, 276[][]82</ref><ref name=Stroyan/> For example, Alexander's horned aphids are a type of soldier aphid that has a hard [[exoskeleton]] and [[pincer]]-like mouthparts.<ref>page 144 of ''Insects and Spiders'', Time-Life Books, ISBN 0809496879</ref> Infestation of a variety of Chinese trees by Chinese sumac aphids  (''Melaphis chinensis Bell'') can create a "Chinese gall" which is valued as a commercial product. As "Galla Chinensis", Chinese galls are used as a medication used in [[Chinese medicine]] to treat [[cough]]s, [[diarrhea]], night sweats, [[dysentry]] and to stop intestinal and uterine bleeding.  Chinese galls are also an important source of [[tannin]]s.<ref name=Stroyan/>

Some species of aphid, known as "woolly aphids" (''[[Eriosomatinae]]''), excrete a "fluffy wax coating" for protection.<ref name=Stroyan/> 

The cabbage aphid (''[[Brevicoryne brassicae]]'') stores and releases chemicals that produce a violent [[chemical reaction]] and strong [[mustard oil]] smell to repel predators. 

It was common at one time to suggest that the cornicles were the source of the honeydew, and this was even included in the ''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]''<ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v211/n5044/abs/211073a0.html ''Defence by Smear: Supercooling in the Cornicle Wax of Aphids''], John S.

== Effects on plants ==
Plants exhibiting aphid damage can have a variety of symptoms, such as decreased growth rates, mottled leaves, yellowing, stunted growth, curled leaves, browning, wilting, low yields and death. The removal of sap creates a lack of vigour in the plant, and aphid saliva is toxic to plants. Aphids frequently transmit disease-causing organisms like [[plant virus]]es to their hosts.  The green peach aphid (''Myzus persicae'') is a vector for more than 110 plant viruses. Cotton aphids (''Aphis gossypii'') often infect [[sugarcane]], [[papaya]] and [[groundnut]]s with viruses.<ref name=mcgavin/> Aphids contributed to the spread of [[late blight]] (''Phytophthora infestans'') among [[potato]]es in the [[Great Irish Potato Famine]] of the 1840s.<ref>page 61 of ''The Most Extreme Bugs'', Catherine Nichols, Forward by Kevin Mohs and Ian McGee, Jossey-Bass, [[John Wiley and Sons]], 2007, ISBN 9780787986636</ref> 

The coating of plants with honeydew can contribute to the spread of fungi which can damage plants.<ref>[http://creatures.ifas.ufl.edu/field/bugs/Y_sugarcane_aphid_01.htm Sooty mold fungus growing on honeydew deposited on lower sugarcane leaves by yellow sugarcane aphids, Sipha flava (Forbes)''], University of Florida</ref><ref>[http://www.umassgreeninfo.org/fact_sheets/diseases/sooty_mold.pdf ''Sooty mold''], Daniel H.

A hypothesis that insect feeding may improve plant fitness was floated in the mid-1970s by Owen and Wiegert. It was felt that the excess honeydew would nourish soil micro-organisms, including nitrogen fixers. In a nitrogen poor environment, this could provide an advantage to an infested plant over a noninfested plant. However, this does not appear to be supported by the observational evidence.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/3565718 ''Aphid Honeydew: A re-appraisal of the hypothesis of Owen and Wiegert''], Dhurpad Choudhury, Oikos, Vol. 45, No. 2 (Oct., 1985), pp. 287-290</ref>     

The damage of plants, and in particular commercial crops, has resulted in large amounts of resources and efforts being spent attempting to control the activities of aphids.<ref name=mcgavin/>

== In popular culture ==

In the movie ''[[Antz]]'',  Weaver says to Zee "Don't you want your aphid beer?" Zee replies "I can't help it. I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature. Call me crazy." 

In the movie ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', the [[List_of_A_Bug's_Life_characters#The_Queen|Ant Queen]] has a pet aphid named [[List_of_A_Bug's_Life_characters#Aphie|Aphie]].<ref>[http://pixar.wikia.com/wiki/Aphie Wikia article on Aphie]</ref>

In the book ''[[A Scanner Darkly]]'', Jerry Fabin is tormented by [[hallucination]]s of aphids crawling all over his body. In the film ''Freck'' is the one tormented by the aphids.
