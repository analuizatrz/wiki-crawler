'''New York State Route 11B''' is a [[state highway]] in northern [[New York]], [[USA]]. NY 11B acts as a link between [[Franklin County, New York|Franklin County]] in the east and [[St. Lawrence County, New York|St. Lawrence County]] in the west. 

NY 11B provides a parallel east-west route to [[U.S. Route 11 (New York)|U.S. Route 11]], but follows a more southerly path between [[Potsdam (village), New York|Potsdam]] and [[Malone (village), New York|Malone]]. The western terminus is at a junction with US 11 in the village of Potsdam. The eastern terminus is at a junction with US 11, [[New York State Route 30|NY 30]], and [[New York State Route 37|NY 37]] in the village of Malone.

==History==
The segment of modern NY 11B from [[Potsdam (village), New York|Potsdam]] to the [[Lawrence, St. Lawrence County, New York|Lawrence]] hamlet of Nicholville was originally designated as '''New York State Route 2A''' in the mid-1920s.<ref>{{cite news|title=New York's Main Highways Designated by Numbers|work=[[New York Times]]|date=[[1924-12-21]]|page=XX9}}</ref><ref name=1926map>{{cite map|url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midatlantic/NewYork/unitedstates1926ra_009.html|title=Rand McNally Auto Road Atlas (eastern New York)|publisher=[[Rand McNally]]|year=1926|accessdate=2008-03-28}}</ref> When [[New York State Route 2 (1924)|NY 2]] was redesignated as [[U.S. Route 11 (New York)|U.S. Route 11]] in 1927, NY 2A was replaced with a rerouted [[New York State Route 56 (1920s)|NY 56]].<ref>''Automobile Blue Book'', (Automobile Blue Books Inc., Chicago, 1927), Vol. 1</ref> The portion of NY 56 east of Potsdam was renumbered to [[New York State Route 72|NY 72]] as part of the [[1930 renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering]]. At the same time, NY 11B was assigned to the pre-1927 routing of NY 56 between NY 72 in Nicholville and [[U.S. Route 11 (New York)|U.S. Route 11]] in Lawrenceville.<ref name=renum>{{cite news|author=Leon A. Dickinson|title=New Signs for State Highways|work=[[New York Times]]|date=[[1930-01-12]]|page=136}}</ref><ref name=1926map /> By 1935, NY 11B was extended westward to Potsdam, creating a lengthy [[overlap (road)|overlap]] with NY 72, while a connector between NY 11B in Nicholville and US 11 in [[Malone (village), New York|Malone]] was designated '''New York State Route 187'''.<ref>{{cite map |title=Road Map & Historical Guide - New York |publisher=[[Sun Oil Company]] |year=1935 |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]]}}</ref> Within three years, NY 11B was rerouted again to follow the length of NY 187 to Malone.<ref name=1938gb>''Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book'', 1938/39 edition, (W.A. Thibodeau, 1938).</ref>

Between 1938 and 1947, NY 72 was rerouted west of the [[Hopkinton, New York|Hopkinton]] hamlet of the same name to follow its current alignment south of NY 11B, eliminating all but {{convert|2|mi|km}} of the overlap.<ref name=1938gb /><ref>{{cite map |title=Official Highway Map of New York State |publisher=[[State of New York Department of Public Works]] |edition=1947-48 |cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}</ref> It was removed entirely in the early 1970s when NY 72 was truncated to its current eastern terminus.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York Thruway |publisher=[[New York State Thruway Authority]] |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]] |year=1971}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |title=New York and New Jersey Tourgide<!--sic--> Map |publisher=[[Gulf Oil|Gulf]] |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]] |year=1974}}</ref> On [[April 1]], [[1980]], ownership and maintenance of NY 11B between Wellington Street and [[New York State Route 30|NY 30]] was transferred from the village of Malone to [[New York State]] as part of a highway maintenance swap between the state and [[Franklin County, New York|Franklin County]].<ref>{{cite web|author=[[New York State Legislature]]|url=http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS|title=Highway Law, Article 12, Section 341|accessdate=2008-03-28}}</ref>
