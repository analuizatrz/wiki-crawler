==Early life==
Born in [[Shoreditch]], [[London]] in 1937<ref>GRO Register of Births: SEP 1937 1a 176 STEPNEY - Barbara A. Deeks, mmn = Ellis</ref>, Windsor was the only child of a [[costermonger]] and [[dressmaker]], John and Rose Deeks. She passed the [[Eleven plus|11 plus]] exam with high marks, and her mother paid for her to have elocution lessons. Her first film appearance was in ''[[The Belles of St Trinian's]]'' in 1954. She joined [[Joan Littlewood]]'s [[Theatre Workshop]], coming to prominence in their stage and film production of ''[[Sparrows Can't Sing]]'' in 1963, achieving a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] nomination for Best British Film Actress. She also appeared in the 1964 film comedy ''[[Crooks in Cloisters]]'' and in the sitcoms ''[[The Rag Trade]]'' and ''[[Wild, Wild Women]]''.

==''Carry On'' films==
However, Windsor came to real prominence with her portrayals of a good time girl in nine [[Carry On films|''Carry On'' films]] and several TV specials between 1964 and 1977. Her first Carry On film was ''[[Carry On Spying]]'' and the last one ''[[Carry On Dick]]''. She refused to take part in any more ''"because she thought they had gone beyond the innocent sauciness which initially drew her to the series"''. Her most famous piece was in ''[[Carry On Camping]]'' in a scene during which she was doing outdoor aerobic exercises and her bikini top flew off. Her 10 Carry On films were: ''[[Carry On Spying]]'', ''[[Carry On Doctor]]'', ''[[Carry On Camping]]'', ''[[Carry On Again Doctor]]'', ''[[Carry On Henry]]'', ''[[Carry On Matron]]'', ''[[Carry on Abroad]]'', ''[[Carry On Girls]]'', ''[[Carry On Dick]]'', and ''That's Carry On''. 

She also starred on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the Theatre Workshop's ''[[Oh! What a Lovely War]]'' and received a 1965 [[Tony Award]] nomination for [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical|Best Featured Actress in a Musical]].

Barbara Windsor was the recipient of the inaugural [[Rear of the Year]] title in 1976.

==''EastEnders''==
After a gradual fall from the top, which also saw her first husband, [[Ronnie Knight]], flee to [[Spain]] on bank robbery charges, she considered quitting acting. Windsor once claimed that her biggest professional regret was that they only wanted unknown faces in TV's ''[[EastEnders]]''.<ref>Hibbin, Sally and Nina Hibbin. ''What a Carry On: The Official Story of the Carry On Film series'', Hamlyn, 1988. ISBN 0-600-55819-3 p 43</ref> However, in 1994, Windsor was offered the role of [[Peggy Mitchell]] in the series. For this role she was rewarded in 1999 with ''Best Actress'' from the [[British Soap Awards]].

==Recent years==
In 1999, she released her debut self titled album which featured a duet with [[Mike Reid (entertainer)|Mike Reid]] called ''[[The More I See You]]''. This reached #44 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]s.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} In 2000, she was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] ''(Member of the Order of the British Empire)'' in the 2000 Queen's New Year's Honours List.
After a debilitating case of the [[Epstein-Barr virus]] saw her take a two year long absence from ''EastEnders'' from 2003 to 2005, with just a brief return for two episodes in 2004, she rejoined the cast on a full-time basis in the summer of 2005 and signed a one year contract. She appeared briefly in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[Army of Ghosts]]" as Peggy Mitchell in a fictional episode of ''EastEnders''.

Windsor examined her family tree in the first episode of the third series of the documentary series ''[[Who Do You Think You Are?]]'', which aired on [[6 September]] [[2006]], in which she traced her family tree back eleven generations to John Golding, the great-great-grandfather of the famous painter [[John Constable]], making him Windsor's fourth cousin six times removed.

==Marriages==
Barbara Windsor has married three times:
#[[Ronnie Knight]] (married [[2 March]] [[1964]]<ref>GRO Register of Marriages: MAR 1964 5e 828 EDMONTON - Ronald J. Knight = Barbara A. Deeks</ref>, divorced January 1985)

#Scott Mitchell (married [[8 April]] [[2000]]<ref>GRO Register of Marriages: APR 2000 258 284 WESTMINSTER - Scott Mitchell = Barbara A Windsor</ref>)
During her first marriage, she had an affair with her ''Carry On'' co-star, [[Sid James]]. She was also romantically linked to the gangster [[Kray twins|Reggie Kray]] in the 1960s. In her autobiography, ''All of Me'', Windsor openly talks about her five [[abortion]]s, the first three of which took place before the age of 21, and the last occurring when she was 42. She was a real life landlady when she ran a pub at [[Winchmore Hill, Buckinghamshire]] with second husband Stephen Hollings.<ref name="digitalspy" />
