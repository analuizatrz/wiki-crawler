"'''Lisa the Skeptic'''" is the eighth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 9)|ninth season]], first aired on [[November 23]], [[1997]].  On an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] dig with her class, Lisa discovers a skeleton that resembles an angel.  All of the townspeople believe that the skeleton actually came from an angel, but [[skepticism|skeptical]] Lisa attempts to persuade them that there must be a [[rational skepticism|rational scientific]] explanation.  The skeleton is later revealed to be a [[publicity stunt]] for a new mall going up in Springfield, and the townspeople forget their concerns about the skeleton to go shopping.  

Writer [[David S. Cohen]] had the inspiration for the episode after visiting the [[American Museum of Natural History]], and decided to loosely parallel themes from the [[Scopes Trial|Scopes Monkey Trial]].  The episode has been discussed in the context of concepts involving [[virtual reality]], [[ontology]], [[existentialism]], and skepticism.  The episode received mixed reviews, but has since been used in Christian religious education classes to form a discussion around angels, skepticism, and the balance between science and faith.

== Plot == 
As [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] attempts to get a [[motorboat]], a new [[shopping mall]] in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] is being built on an area where a large number of [[fossil]]s were found. [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] condemns and protests the building of the mall. Thanks to her protest, it prompts the school to conduct an archaeological dig. During the excavations, Lisa finds a human skeleton with wings. Springfield's residents are convinced it is an [[angel]], and Homer cashes in by moving the skeleton into the family's garage. Lisa remains skeptical and&mdash;believing it may not actually be an angel&mdash;has [[Stephen Jay Gould]] test a sample. When Dr. Gould appears at the Simpson house the next day to tell Lisa that the tests were inconclusive, Lisa goes on television to compare the belief in angels to the belief in [[unicorn]]s and [[leprechaun]]s. In response, Springfield's religious zealots go on a rampage to destroy all scientific institutions (including, in a side joke, the destruction of a [[Christian Science]] library). Appalled by the violence, Lisa goes into the garage to destroy the skeleton, only to find that it has disappeared. The mob soon converges on the Simpson household, and Lisa is promptly arrested and put on trial for stealing the skeleton.  However, before the trial can proceed, the courtroom's attention is diverted when the skeleton appears outside.

When the skeleton reappears, it carries a foreboding message that "[[Apocalypse|The End]]" will come at sundown. Meanwhile, Judge Snyder issues a [[injunction|restraining order]] to keep science and religion 500&nbsp;yards apart at all times. Sundown approaches, and Springfield's citizens are frightened, but nothing catastrophic occurs. Lisa gets prepared to tell off everyone and when she begins, the skeleton suddenly yells "Prepare for the end... the end of high prices!" and is hoisted over to the entrance of a new discount shopping mall. Lisa realizes that the "end is near" saga was actually a [[publicity stunt]] for the mall as a way to exploit the deepest beliefs of people, and calls for a [[boycott]] of the mall. She fails, and the bargain-hunting public go shopping anyway. Dr. Gould subsequently confesses that he did not actually do any testing. In the end Marge points out to Lisa that, despite all her skepticism, for a few seconds while the Angel was rising Lisa really did believe the Angel was real. Lisa denies this, but thanks her mother for her support in her moment of weakness.<ref name="officialsite" /><ref name="parvin">{{cite book  | last = Parvin | first = Samuel F. | coauthors = Mark I.

"Lisa the Skeptic" was written by [[David X. Cohen|David S.

In an early draft of the script, the skeleton was made of baked pasty dough, baked by the mall's window dresser.<ref name="Cohen" />  Cohen had initially written Steven Jay Gould's part as being a generic scientist or [[paleontologist]], not knowing that they would eventually get Gould. He had taken Gould's Introduction to Paleontology class at [[Harvard University]].<ref name="Cohen" />  The only phrase Gould had objected to in the script was a line that introduced him as the "world's most brilliant paleontologist."<ref name="Scully">{{cite video | people=Scully, Mike |year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 9 DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa the Skeptic"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>  His original final line was "I didn't do the test. I had more important work to do" but was cut because the writers felt it would be better to give him a short final line. Also, some thought it was too mean.<ref name="Cohen" />  In an earlier version of the episode, Marge would have ended up apologizing to Lisa for not supporting her, letting the ending be more of a nod to Lisa's correct assumptions all along.<ref name="Cohen" />

Author Joley Wood compared "Lisa the Skeptic" to an [[alternate reality game]], in analyzing the effects of watching the television program ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' on contemporary culture and our own perceptions of reality.<ref>{{cite book | last =Wood | first =Joley | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Living Lost: Why We're All Stuck on the Island | publisher =Garrett County Press | date =2006 | location = | pages =12 | url = | doi = | id =   | isbn = 1891053027}}</ref>  Dan O'Brien cited the episode in a discussion of [[ontology]], skepticism and religious faith, in his book ''An Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge''.<ref name="obrien">{{cite book | last =O'Brien | first =Dan | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =An Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge | publisher =Polity | date =2006 | location = | pages =189 | url = | doi = | id =  | isbn = 0745633161}}</ref>  O'Brien leaves it up to the reader to decide whether or not Lisa was justified in her skepticism.<ref name="obrien" />  In ''The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer'', "Lisa the Skeptic" is cited as a prime example of why Lisa is seen as the epitome of a [[nerd]].<ref name="irwin" />  The book also cited the episode in noting that Lisa is not infallible, for when the Angel appeared to speak at the end of the episode she became as frightened as everyone else.<ref name="irwin" />  Lisa's frustration with the marketing gimmick used by the mall developers is seen by Turner's ''Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Defined a Generation'' as yet another example of her conflict with [[corporation]]s throughout the series.<ref name="turner" />  Like O'Brien, Turner also analyzed the episode in the context of Lisa's questions about [[existentialism]], self-absorption and [[consumption]].<ref name="turner" />  In ''[[The Psychology of The Simpsons|The Psychology of the Simpsons: D'oh!]]'', the authors discuss Lisa's level of anger displayed in the episode, noting that in this particular case her anger gave her the wherewithal to both confront [[social injustice]], and keep her mind clear for [[critical thought|critical thinking]].<ref name="brown" />   Mark Demming of ''[[All Movie Guide]]'' noted that Lisa symbolically stood for the side of reason, while her mother Marge symbolized belief and spirituality in the episode.<ref>{{cite news

Parvin's ''The Gospel According to the Simpsons: Leader's Guide for Group Study'' is a group study guide companion to Pinsky's ''The Gospel According to the Simpsons.''<ref name="parvin" />  In the section pertaining to "Lisa the Skeptic," a skeptic is defined as: "a person who doubts, questions or suspends judgment on ideas generally accepted by others.<ref name="parvin" />  The group study group is asked to debate the episode in the context of skepticism as related to other unexplained phenomena, including [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]], the [[Loch Ness Monster]], the [[Abominable Snowman]], the [[Bermuda Triangle]], [[Atlantis]], [[near-death experiences]], [[reincarnation]], [[Mediumship]], [[psychic]]s, and [[fortune telling]].<ref name="parvin" />  In Pinsky's book itself, he noted that Lisa faced the difficult task of confronting [[zealotry|religious hysteria]] and [[faith|blind faith]], and also attempted to reconcile science within her own belief system.<ref name="pinsky" />  He also wrote that when Lisa asks Stephen Jay Gould to estimate the age of the skeleton, the issue is never raised of why angels or other spiritual entities would even leave skeletons behind in the first place.<ref name="pinsky" />

== Cultural references ==
The scene in Judge Snyder's courtroom where Lisa is put on trial for stealing the skeleton is seen as a reference to the 1920s [[Scopes Trial|Scopes Monkey Trial]] in [[Dayton, Tennessee]], which dealt with issues of [[separation of church and state]] and the debate between [[creationism]] and [[evolutionism]].<ref name="pinsky">{{cite book | last =Pinsky | first =Mark I. | authorlink = | coauthors =Tony Campolo | title =The Gospel According to the Simpsons: The Spiritual Life of the World's Most Animated Family | publisher =Westminster John Knox Press | date =2001 | location = | pages =43, 133, 182 | url = | doi = | id =   | isbn =0664224199 }}</ref>  The publicity stunt created by the mall developers in the episode has been compared to scientific [[hoax]]es such as the [[Cardiff Giant]] and the [[Piltdown Man]].<ref name="pinsky" />  When Lisa asks if the townspeople are outraged at the end of the episode for being fooled by a publicity stunt, [[Clancy Wiggum|Police chief Wiggum]] is about to answer her but is distracted when he catches sight of a [[Pottery Barn]] in the new Heavenly Hills mall.<ref name="turner" />

== Reception ==
Donald Liebenson wrote for the ''[[Amazon.com]]'' movie review that "[[Bart Sells His Soul]]" and "Lisa the Skeptic" were not among the best episodes of ''The Simpsons'', however he also noted that: "Without being preachy (or particularly funny), this episode is pretty potent stuff," citing its theme of [[Apocalypse]] towards the end of the episode.<ref>{{cite news  | last =Liebenson | first =Donald  | coauthors = | title =The Simpsons Trick Or Treehouse: Vol. 3 Heaven & Hell (vhs): Amazon.com movie review | work =[[Amazon.com]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = | url =http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096697/amazon | accessdate =  2007-10-29}}</ref>  "Lisa the Skeptic" was utilized in a [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] [[Episcopal Church]] [[Sunday school]] class in 2003, to stimulate a discussion among fourteen-year olds about belief in angels, and the juxtaposition of science and faith.<ref name="jarvik">{{cite news  | last =Jarvik | first =Elaine | coauthors = | title =Sun-Doh!
