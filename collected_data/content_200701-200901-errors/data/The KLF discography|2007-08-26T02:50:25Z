In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[The KLF]] and their incarnations released six albums and a wide array of diverse 12&nbsp;" singles on their own [[independent record label]] '''KLF Communications''' during its five-year existence. In other territories their material was typically issued under licence by local labels. Despite being a [[DIY ethic|DIY]] release, the 1988 single "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]" sold over one million copies,<ref name="select92">Shaw, William, "Who Killed The KLF?", ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'', July 1992 [http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=315 link]</ref> and The KLF became the best-selling British singles act in the world during 1991.<ref name="AMG">Bush, John, KLF biography, ''[[All Music Guide]]'' ([http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:2tkku3y5anok~T1 link])</ref><ref name="TimeGents">"Timelords gentlemen, please!", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', [[16 May]] [[1992]] ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=309 link])</ref>

From their very earliest releases as [[The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu]] until their [[The KLF#Retirement|retirement]] in 1992, the music of Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty was [[independent record label|independently released]] in their home country (the [[United Kingdom|UK]])<ref name="discogs">KLF Communications profile at [[Discogs.com]] ([http://www.discogs.com/label/KLF+Communications link])</ref>. Their debut releases - the single "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs)|All You Need Is Love]]" and the album ''[[1987 (album)|1987]]'' - were released under the label name "The Sound Of Mu(sic)". However, by the end of 1987 Drummond and Cauty had renamed their label to "KLF Communications" and, in October 1987, the first of many "information sheets" (self written missives from The KLF to fans and the media) was sent out by the label.<ref>Drummond, B. (1987), ''KLF Info Sheet Oct 1987'' ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=500 link]). The KLF Communications Info Sheets are all archived at [http://www.libraryofmu.org/browse-type.php?tid=1 The Library of Mu]</ref>

KLF Communications releases were [[record distributor|distributed]] by [[Rough Trade Distribution]] (a spinoff of [[Rough Trade Records]]) in the South East of England, and across the wider UK by [[The Cartel]]. As Drummond and Cauty explained, "The Cartel is, as the name implies, a group of independent distributors across the country who work in conjunction with each other providing a solid network of distribution without stepping on each other's toes. We are distributed by the Cartel."<ref name="the-manual">Drummond, B. & Cauty, J. (1989) [[The Manual|The Manual (How To Have a Number One The Easy Way)]], KLF Publications (KLF 009B), UK. ISBN 0-86359-616-9. ([http://www.kasino.co.uk/klf.txt Link to full text])</ref> When Rough Trade Distribution distribution collapsed in 1991 it was reported that they owed KLF Communications Â£500,000.<ref>"KLF chase money ... and McCulloch", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 29 February 1992 ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=295 link])</ref> (In the same feature it was reported that Drummond wished to sign [[Ian McCulloch (singer)|Ian McCulloch]] to the label, but this never happened). Plugging (the promotion to TV and radio) was handled by long time associate [[Scott Piering]]<ref name="the-manual"/>.

Outside the UK, KLF releases were issued under licence by local labels. In the [[USA]], the licensees were [[Wax Trax]] (the ''[[Chill Out (album)|Chill Out]]'' album<ref>''[[All Music Guide]]'' review of ''Chill Out'' ([http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:lif6zf0hehak link])</ref>), [[TVT]] (early releases including ''[[The History of The JAMs a.k.a. The Timelords]]''<ref>''[[All Music Guide]]'' review of ''The History of The JAMs a.k.a. The Timelords'' ([http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:7jdsa9tgb23f link])</ref>), and [[Arista Records]] (''[[The White Room]]'' and singles<ref>''[[All Music Guide]]'' review of ''The White Room/Justified & Ancient'' ([http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:iv09ke9tjq70 link])</ref><ref>Bill Drummond explained the licensing situation - and inducements made by Arista - in an interview by Ernie Longmire, X Magazine, July 1991 ([http://cardhouse.com/x07/klf.html link])</ref>).

Drummond and Cauty also published a book under the imprint "KLF Publications" - ''[[The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)]]'' (ISBN 0-86359-616-9).
