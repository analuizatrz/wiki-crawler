== Background ==
{{main|Israel-Lebanon conflict}}
The [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) had engaged in cross-border attacks from [[southern Lebanon]] into Israel as far back as 1968, and the area became a significant base following the arrival of the PLO leadership and its [[Fatah]] brigade after their 1971 [[Black September in Jordan|expulsion from Jordan]]. [[Demographics of Lebanon|Demographic tensions]] were running high over the Lebanese [[National Pact]], which divided governmental powers among religious groups, leading in part to the [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975-1990). Concurrently, Syria began a [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon|29 year military occupation]]. Israel's [[Operation Litani|1978 invasion of Lebanon]] failed to stem the Palestinian attacks, but [[1982 Lebanon War|Israel invaded Lebanon]] again in 1982 and forcibly expelled the PLO.<ref name="Encarta: PLO">{{cite web

Combat with Hezbollah weakened Israeli resolve and led to a collapse of the SLA and an early Israeli withdrawal in 2000 to their side of the [[Blue Line (Lebanon)|UN designated border]]. Citing Israeli control of the disputed [[Shebaa farms]] region and the incarceration of [[Lebanese prisoners in Israel]], Hezbollah continued cross border attacks, and used the tactic of seizing soldiers from Israel as leverage for a [[Israeli MIA prisoner exchanges|prisoner exchange]] in 2004,<ref name="Institute for Palestinian Studies">{{cite web

On [[July 16]], the [[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli Cabinet]] released a communique explaining that, although Israel had engaged in military operations ''within'' Lebanon, its war was not against the Lebanese government.

When asked in August about the proportionality of the response, Prime Minister Olmert stated that the "war started not only by killing eight Israeli soldiers and abducting two but by shooting Katyusha and other rockets on the northern cities of Israel on that same morning. Indiscriminately." He added "no country in Europe would have responded in such a restrained manner as Israel did."<ref>{{cite web

The UN observer reportedly wrote that previous Israeli bombing near the post had not been deliberate targeting, but rather due to "tactical necessity," military jargon which retired Canadian Major General [[Lewis MacKenzie]] later interpreted as indicating that Israeli strikes were aimed at Hezbollah targets extremely close to the post.

Terms for a ceasefire had been drawn and revised several times over the course of the conflict, yet successful agreement between the two sides took several weeks.

On [[11 August]] [[2006]] the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved [[UN Security Council Resolution 1701]], in an effort to end the hostilities. It was accepted by the Lebanese government and Hezbollah on [[12 August]] [[2006]], and by the Israeli government on [[13 August]] [[2006]].

On [[21 August]], a group of demobilized Israel reserve soldiers and parents of soldiers killed in the fighting started [[2006 Israeli reserve soldiers' protest|a movement]] calling for the resignation of Ehud Olmert and the establishment of a state commission of [[Public inquiry|inquiry]]. They set up a protest tent opposite the Knesset and grew to over 2,000 supporters by [[25 August]],<ref name="Yoman">[http://switch3.castup.net/cunet/gm.asp?ai=31&ar=yoman "Yoman"], ''[[Israel Broadcasting Authority]]'', [[25 August]] [[2006]] {{he icon}}</ref> including the influential [[Movement for Quality Government in Israel|Movement for Quality Government]].<ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3295083,00.html "Hundreds support protesting reservists"], ''[[Ynetnews]]'', [[24 August]] [[2006]]</ref><ref name="Yoman"/> On [[28 August]], Olmert [[2006 Israeli reserve soldiers' protest#Prospects for a state commission|announced]] that there would be no independent state or governmental commission of inquiry, but two internal inspection probes, one to investigate the political echelon and one to examine IDF, and likely a third commission to examine the Home Front, to be announced at a later date. These would have a more limited mandate and less authority than a single inquiry commission headed by a retired judge.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/755787.html "Olmert: An inquiry commission will not be formed, we do not have the luxury to submerge in investigating the past"], ''[[Haaretz]]'', [[28 August]] [[2006]] {{he icon}}</ref> The political and military committees were to be headed by former director of [[Mossad]] [[Nahum Admoni]] and former [[Ramatkal|Chief of Staff]] [[Amnon Lipkin-Shahak]], respectively. Critics argued that these committees amount to a [[whitewash]], due to their limited authority, limited investigatory scope, their self-appointed basis, and that neither would be headed by a retired judge.<ref>[http://switch3.castup.net/cunet/gm.asp?ai=31&ar=mabat "Mabat"], ''[[Israel Broadcasting Authority]]'', [[28 August]] [[2006]] {{he icon}}</ref>

Due to these pressures, on [[11 October]], Admoni was replaced by retired justice [[Eliyahu Winograd]] as chair of the political probe, and the probe itself was elevated to the status of governmental commission with near-state commission mandate: the [[Winograd Commission]]. On [[12 September]], former defense minister [[Moshe Arens]] spoke of "the defeat of Israel" in calling for a state committee of inquiry.

Several media commentators and journalists have alleged an intentionally distorted coverage of the events, in favour of Hezbollah, by means of [[photo manipulation]], staging by Hezbollah or by journalists, and false or misleading captioning.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YjVlMmRjNDllNzhkZmE1OWM3NmE1OGQ4OGQxMDA1YjQ= |title=Media Missiles: Working for the enemy|author=Tom Gross|publisher=[[National Review]]|date=[[August 2]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-04-30}}</ref>

On [[18 July]] [[2006]] Hezbollah Press Officer Hussein Nabulsi took CNN's [[Nic Robertson]] on an exclusive tour of southern Beirut. Robertson noted that despite his minder's anxiety about explosions in the area, it was clear that Hezbollah had sophisticated media relations and were in control of the situation. Hezbollah designated the places that they went to, and the journalists "certainly didn't have time to go into the houses or lift up the rubble to see what was underneath." According to his reports, there was no doubt that the bombs were hitting Hezbollah facilities, and while there appeared to be "a lot of civilian damage, a lot of civilian properties," he reiterated that he couldn't verify the civilian nature of the destroyed buildings.<ref name="reliable">{{cite news|title=CNN RELIABLE SOURCES, Coverage of Mideast Conflict|url= http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0607/23/rs.01.html |publisher=[[CNN]]|date=[[2006-07-23]]}}</ref>

[[CNN]]'s Charlie Moore described a Hezbollah press tour of a bombed-out area in southern Beirut on [[23 July]] [[2006]] as a "dog-and-pony show" due to perceived staging, misrepresentation of the nature of the destroyed areas, and strict directives about when and with whom interviews could take place.<ref>{{cite news|title=Our very strange day with Hezbollah|url= http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/anderson.cooper.360/blog/archives/2006_07_23_ac360_archive.html |publisher=[[CNN]]|date=[[2006-07-23]]}}</ref>

In the same interview aired on [[23 July]] [[2006]], CNN's [[John Roberts (television reporter)|John Roberts]], who was reporting from an Israeli artillery battery on the Lebanese border, stated that he had to take everything he was told — either by the IDF or Hezbollah — "with a grain of salt," citing mutual recriminations of civilian targeting which he was unable to verify independently.<ref name="reliable"/>

[[Reuters]] withdrew over 900 photographs by [[Adnan Hajj photographs controversy|Adnan Hajj]], a Lebanese freelance photographer, after he admitted to digitally adding and darkening smoke spirals in photographs of an attack on Beirut.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalphotopro.com/dppthisweek/2006/08/08/reuters-withdraws-all-photos-by-lebanese-freelance |title=Reuters withdraws all photos by Lebanese freelance||publisher=[[Reuters]] via [[Werner Publishing Corporation|Digital Photo Pro]]|date=[[August 7]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-04-30}}</ref>

Photographs submitted to Reuters and [[Associated Press]] showed one Lebanese woman mourning on two different pictures taken by two photographers, allegedly taken two weeks apart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2006/08/trusting_photos.html  |title=Trusting photos|author=Steve Herrmann (BBC Editor)|publisher=[[BBC News Online]] editors' blog|date=[[8 August]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-04-30}}</ref> While it is "common practice to send more than one photographer to an incident",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2006/08/reuters_adnan_h.html|title=Reuters: Adnan Hajj is not still taking photos for us|author=Mark Memmott|publisher=[[USA Today]] editors' blog|date=[[August 09]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-04-30}}</ref> questions remained as to whether the images were wrongly captioned or deliberately staged.

In the days following the [[14 August]] [[2006]] ceasefire, Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets and mortars inside southern Lebanon, which Israel did not respond to, though there were several instances where Israeli troops killed armed Hezbollah members approaching their positions.<ref>{{cite web

On 3rd of October, an Israeli fighter penetrated the {{convert|2|nmi|km|0|sing=on}} defence perimeter of the French frigate ''[[Courbet (F 712)|Courbet]]'' without answer radio calls, triggering a diplomatic incident <ref>{{fr icon}} [http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/20061110.FIG000000186_l_armee_francaise_au_liban_se_sent_menacee_par_israel.html L'armée française au Liban se sent menacée par Israël], ''[[Le Figaro]]''</ref>

On [[24 October]], six [[IAF|Israeli]] [[F-16]]'s flew over a [[German Navy]] vessel patrolling off Israel's coast just south of the Lebanese border. The German Defence Ministry said that the planes had given off infrared decoys and one of the aircraft had fired two shots into the air, which had not been specifically aimed. The Israeli military said that a German helicopter took off from the vessel without having coordinated this with Israel, and denied vehemently having fired any shots at the vessel and said "as of now" it also had no knowledge of the jets launching flares over it. Israeli Defence Minister [[Amir Peretz]] telephoned his German counterpart [[Franz Josef Jung]] to clarify that 'Israel has no intention to carry out any aggressive actions' against the German peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, who are there as part of [[UNIFIL]] to enforce an arms embargo against Hezbollah. Germany confirmed the consultations, and that both sides were interested in maintaining good cooperation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.teluguportal.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=18958|title=Germany, Israel confirm naval vessel-planes incident|date=[[2006]][[28 October]]|publisher=Telugu Portal}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.monstersandcritics.com/middleeast/article_1214671.php/Germany_Israel_confirm_naval_vessel-planes_incident|title=Germany, Israel confirm naval vessel-planes incident|date=[[2006]][[28 October]]|publisher=Middle East News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://story.malaysiasun.com/index.php/ct/9/cid/b8de8e630faf3631/id/ba4623e8cf1e387d/|title=Israel denies firing shots at German ship|date=[[2006]][[28 October]]|publisher=[[Ynetnews]]}}</ref>

On [[1 December]] [[2006]], U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan submitted a report to the Security Council president maintaining "there were no serious incidents or confrontations" since the cease-fire in August 2006. He did, however, note that peacekeepers reported air violations by Israel "almost on a daily basis," which Israel maintained were a security measure related to continuing Syrian and Iranian arms shipments to Hezbollah, and evidence of the presence of unauthorized armed personnel, assets, and weapons in Lebanon. In one case, a UNIFIL demining team was challenged by two Hezbollah members in combat uniforms armed with [[AK-47|AK-47 rifles]]. UNIFIL notified the Lebanese army, who arrested three suspects the next day. There were also "13 instances where UNIFIL came across unauthorized arms or related material in its area of operation", including the discovery of 17 katyusha rockets and several improvised explosive devices in [[Rachaiya El-Foukhar]], and the discovery of a weapons cache containing seven missiles, three rocket launchers, and a substantial amount of ammunition in the area of [[Bourhoz]].<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/02/news/UN_GEN_UN_Lebanon_Peacekeepers.php Annan: Israel's actions compromise efforts to stabilize the Israeli-Lebanon border]</ref><ref name="ynet_annan_report">Ynet News ([[2 December]] [[2006]]).

The months after the hostilities saw major upheaval in the Israeli military and political echelon, with the spate of high-ranking resignations including [[Ramatkal|Chief of General Staff]] [[Dan Halutz]],<ref>{{he icon}} "[http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3353464,00.html אולמרט: צר לי מאוד על התפטרות הרמטכ"ל]", ''YNet'', [[2007-01-17]].</ref> and calls for resignations of many cabinet-members including Prime-Minister Ehud Olmert following publication of the [[Winograd Commission]]'s findings.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=3101972 |title=War report sharply criticizes Olmert|author=Steven Gutkin|publisher=[[Associated Press]] via [[ABC News]]|date=[[2007-05-01]] |accessdate=2007-09-23 }}</ref>  The Winograd report severely criticized Olmert, accusing him of a "severe failure in exercising judgment, responsibility and caution."

On [[June 30]], [[2007]], UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-Moon]]'s [[Fourth report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701|fourth report on the implementation of SC Resolution 1701]] fingered Israel, Lebanon and Hezbollah for violating the ceasefire, but called the firing of rockets into Israel by unknown elements "the most serious breach of the cessation of hostilities since the end of the war." The report commended Israel on its restraint following this attack, and commended Lebanon for its continued efforts to disarm armed groups. It further stated that in spite of "flexibility by Israel beyond the framework of UNSC-Resolution 1701, implementation of the resolution's humanitarian aspects has not yet been possible."<ref name = forthReportOfTheSecretaryGeneral>[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&categ_id=2&article_id=83440 Report of the secretary general on the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701], ''The Daily Star''.
