'''Bandhua Mukti Morcha''' ('''BMM''') or '''Bonded Labour Liberation Front''' ('''BLLF''') is a [[non-governmental organisation]] in [[India]] working to end [[bonded labour]]. Based in [[New Delhi]], it was founded in 1981 by [[Swami Agnivesh]] who continues as its chairman.

Bonded labour was legally abolished in India in 1976 but it remains prevalent, with weak enforcement of the law by state governments. Estimates of the problem vary. Official figures include a 1993 estimate of only 251,000 bonded labourers<ref>Statement by observer for India to the United Nations Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery (para 81), report accessed at [http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/TestFrame/3ac98c66e2ac2f85802566c2003ce975?Opendocument] September 7, 2006</ref> while BMM says there are 65 million bonded child labourers, and a larger number of adults. A 2003 project by [[Human Rights Watch]] has reported a  major problem with bonded child labour in the [[silk]] industry<ref>''SMALL CHANGE: Bonded Child Labor in India's Silk Industry'', Human Rights Watch, January 2003 accessed at [http://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/india/index.htm#TopOfPage] September 7, 2006</ref> 
 
==Achievements OF '''NEERAV SHARMA''' ==
BMM's efforts are credited with the passing of legislation to abolish child labour in India (the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act 1986. This followed a 1984 [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] decision in a case brought by BMM.<ref>''Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India, 1984 SC 802'' cited (p.39) in T.C.A. Anant and N.L.
