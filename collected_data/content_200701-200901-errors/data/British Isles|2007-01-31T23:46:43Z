The '''British Isles''' are a group of islands off the north west coast of [[continental Europe]] comprising [[Great Britain]], [[Ireland]] and a number of smaller [[islands]].<ref>"British Isles," ''[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]''</ref> The term ''British Isles'' can be [[British Isles (terminology)|misunderstood]] and is sometimes [[British Isles naming dispute|considered objectionable]], mainly in Ireland<ref name= "Myers">[http://www.ireland.com/newspaper/opinion/2000/0309/archive.00030900085.html  An Irishman's Diary] Myers, Kevin; The [[Irish Times]] (subscription needed) 09/03/2000, Accessed July 2006 'millions of people from these islands — oh how angry we get when people call them the British Isles'</ref><ref>"[http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0606/D.0606.200509280360.html Written Answers - Official Terms"], [[Dáil Éireann]] - Volume 606 - 28 September, 2005.

These include the name of the State, the President, [[Taoiseach]] and others."</ref><ref> "[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2385403.html New atlas lets Ireland slip shackles of Britain"]A spokesman for the Irish Embassy in London said: “The British Isles has a dated ring to it, as if we are still part of the Empire.

We would discourage its useage [''sic''].”</ref><ref> Diarmaid MacCulloch, The Reformation: Europe's House Divided 1490-1700. (London: Penguin/Allen Lane, 2003): “the collection of islands which embraces England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales has commonly been known as the British Isles. This title no longer pleases all the inhabitants of the islands, and a more neutral description is ‘the Atlantic Isles’” (p. xxvi)</ref>. The term is not generally used in the Republic of Ireland.

There are two [[sovereign state]]s located on the islands: the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]].<ref>The diplomatic  and constitutional name of the Irish state is simply ''Ireland''. For disambiguation purposes "Republic of Ireland" is often used though technically that is not the name of the state but, according to the ''[[Republic of Ireland Act]] 1948,'' its "description". ''Article 4, Bunreacht na hÉireann. Section 2, Republic of Ireland Act, 1948.''</ref> The group also includes the [[Isle of Man]], a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|United Kingdom]] [[crown dependency]]. Both states, but not the Isle of Man, are members of the [[European Union]]. Between 1801 and 1922, Great Britain and Ireland together formed the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].<ref>Though the [[Irish Free State]] left the United Kingdom on [[6 December]] [[1922]] the name of the United Kingdom was not changed to reflect that until April 1927, when ''Northern Ireland'' was substituted for ''Ireland'' in its name.</ref> In 1922, all but six counties in Ireland left the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom; the remaining six, all in the northeast of the island, became known as [[Northern Ireland]].

The islands extend from [[Pednathise Head]], [[Isles of Scilly]] in the south, to [[Out Stack]], [[Shetland]] in the north; and from [[Tearaght Island]], Ireland in the west, to [[Lowestoft Ness]], [[England]] in the east. There are more than 6,000 islands, amounting to a total land area of 121,674&nbsp;[[square mile]]s (315,134&nbsp;[[Square metre|km²]]). Some sources [http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/Regions/Crown.html] [http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/britishisles/] include the [[Channel Isles]] in the British Isles although geographically they are an offshore [[France|French]] island group 

The British Isles are largely low lying and fertile, though with significant mountainous areas in Ireland,  [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], and the north of England. The regional geology is complex, formed by the [[Plate techtonics|drifting together of separate regions]] and subsequent [[orogenic]], [[Ice age|glacial]] and  [[weathering]] activities.

==Origins of the term==
[[Image:Ptolemy-british-isles.jpg|thumb|350px|A 1490 Italian copy of Ptolomy's ''Geography'' showing ''Ibernia Britannica Insula'' ("Hibernia, Island of Britannia", Ireland), ''Albion Insula Britannica'' ("Albion, Island of Britannia", Great Britain) and ''Mona Insula'' (Isle of Man) separated from the European mainland by ''Oceanus Germanicus'' ("Germanic Ocean", North Sea) to the east and ''Oceanus Britannicus'' ("Britannic Ocean", English Channel) to the south.]]
===Ancient terms===
The earliest known names for the islands come from [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] writings. Though the original texts have been lost, excerpts were quoted or paraphrased by later authors. Parts of the [[Massaliote Periplus]], a merchants' handbook describing searoutes of the [[6th century BC]], were used in translation in the writings of [[Avienus]] around [[AD]] [[400]]. This does not appear to call the islands by a single common name but refers to the main islands separately, ''[[Ériu|Ierne]]'' for Ireland and ''[[Albion]]'' for modern-day Great Britain, describing ''nesos 'Iernon kai 'Albionon'' ("island of the Ierni [Irish] and the Albiones [Albions]"). Cognates of these terms are still used in the other modern languages of the British Isles,<ref>Cognates of ''Albion'' (normally referring only to Scotland) - English: ''Albion'' (archaic); Cornish: ''Alban''; Irish: ''Alba''; Manx: ''Albey''; Scots: ''Albiane''; Scottish Gaelic: ''Alba''; Welsh: ''Yr Alban''.  Cognates of ''Ierne'': English: ''Ireland''; Cornish: ''Iwerdhon''; Irish: ''Éire''; Manx: ''Nerin''; Scots: ''Irland''; Scottish Gaelic: ''Éirinn''; Welsh: ''Iwerddon''</ref> though in English ''Albion'' is deliberately archaic, or poetical. 

Several sources from around [[150 BC]] to [[AD]] [[70]] include fragments of the travel writings of the ancient Greek [[Pytheas]] around [[320 BC]], which also used the terms "Albion and 'Ierne."<ref>Entry for Albion a 1911 Encyclopedia.[http://historymedren.about.com/od/aentries/a/11_albion.htm]</ref> and have been described as referring to the British Isles, including Ireland, as the ''Pretanic Islands''.<ref name=ohi>{{cite book

From the classical era, the ''[[Brython]]s'', or ancient Britons, are referred to as the people who lived in the southern half of modern-day Great Britain, the area conquered by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. This usage continued through Early Modern times<ref>See [[William Shakespeare]], ''[[King Lear]]'' III iv 189.</ref> to the present day.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed. Online Version (2000)</ref> Along with other variants, it was derived from the terms Ρρεττανοι, ''Priteni'' or ''Pretani'',<ref name=snyder/> used by [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and Roman geographers. For example, throughout Book 4 of his ''Geography'', [[Strabo]] calls the island of ''Albion'' as ''Prettanikee'', which was written in Latin as ''Britannia''.  It has been claimed that the term itself referred to the way in which the people first encountered in the south of Great Britain used [[woad]] to decorate their bodies.  According to [[Peter Heylin|Peter Heylyn]], ''Britt'' meant ''paint'' (writing in the 17th century, explaining why he choose to call the region the ''British Isles'', [[British Isles#British Isles|see below]]).<ref>Peter Heylyn, ''Microcosmus'', p.)</ref> Consistent with earlier writers, Strabo does not refer to the islands by a group name, referring to ''Ierne'' separately and only briefly before admitting that he as "no trustworthy witnesses" concerning its inhabitants.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/4E*.html The Geography of Strabo] published in Vol. II of the Loeb Classical Library edition, 1923</ref>

[[Pliny the Elder]] writing around AD 70 uses a Latin version of the same terminology in Book 4 of his ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Naturalis Historia]]''.  Pliny describes the islands he considers to be ''Britanniae'' (plural of ''Britannia''), including Great Britain, Ireland, The Orkneys, smaller islands such as the Hebrides, Isle of Man, Anglesey, possibly one of the Friesan Islands, and islands that have been identified as Ushant and Sian.  He also includes the island of Thule, most often identified as Iceland,<ref name = "Bostock">"The opinions as to the identity of ancient Thule have been numerous in the extreme. We may here mention six: ― 1. The common, and apparently the best founded opinion, that Thule is the island of Iceland. 2. That it is either the Ferroe group, or one of those islands. 3. The notion of Ortelius, Farnaby, and Schœnning, that it is identical with Thylemark in Norway.  4. The opinion of Malte Brun, that the continental portion of Denmark is meant thereby, a part of which is to the present day called Thy or Thyland.  5. The opinion of Rudbeck and of Calstron, borrowed originally from Procopius, that this is a general name for the whole of Scandinavia. 6. That of Gosselin, who thinks that under this name Mainland, the principal of the Shetland Islands, is meant. It is by no means impossible that under the name of Thule two or more of these localities may have been meant, by different authors writing at distant periods and under different states of geographical knowledge.  It is also pretty generally acknowledged, as Parisot remarks, that the Thule mentioned by Ptolemy is identical with Thylemark in Norway."{{cite book |editor=Bostock, John and H.T.

[[Ptolemy]] included essentially the same main islands in the Britannias.  He first described Ireland, which he called ''Hibernia''.  Second was the island of Great Britain, which he called Albion. Book II, Chapters 1 and 2 of his ''Geography'' are respectively titled as ''Hibernia, Island of Britannia'' and ''Albion, Island of Britania''.<ref name = "Ptolemy">[http://www.roman-britain.org/ptolemy.htm  Ptolemy's Geography].</ref>  Interestingly, Ptolemy included Thule in the chapter on Albion, although the coordinates he gives have been mapped to the area around modern Kristiansund in western Norway.<ref>Since meridian 30° P corresponds to our meridian 8°24’E, Thule must be identified with the maze of islands and fjords around the three main islands that form the city of Kristiansund[http://www.metrum.org/mapping/thule.htm].</ref>

===Oceani insulae===

Quite quickly after the imposition of Roman rule in most of Great Britain, ''Britannia'' ceased to have any collective meaning for the archipelago. Instead, Brittania became the preferred Roman term for the island of Great Britain, and in particular the [[Roman Britain|province of Britain]] in the south-east.<ref>''Britannia'' is so widely used in this period to indicate solely the region of modern-day Great Britain under Roman control that a definition of the term is nearly impossible to come across.  However, the following sources identify it in their work: I. Cunningham, C. Fleet & C.W.J. Withers, [http://www.nls.uk/news/folio/issues/folio09.pdf Putting Scotland on view: Joan Blaeu’s 1654 Atlas Novus], Folio, Issue 9, Autumn 2004 ("Yet in 1577, Ortelius had met the man who would provide an historical and geographical account of Britain – or, to use its correct title as a Roman province, ‘Britannia’."), or F.N.Lee, 1997, [http://www.dr-fnlee.org/docs6/cl/cl01/cl01.pdf Common Law: Roots and Fruits] ("The distinguished (530 A.D.) Brythonic historian Gildas says that around A.D. 420 – many parties of "Scots and Picts crossed the Scythian Valley" into the Roman Province of Britannia alias South Britain").  In most cases literature on Roman Britain accepts as matter-of-fact that the reader will understand that ''Britannia'' in this period refers to Roman Britain.</ref> 

Indigenous sources of the post-Roman period use a collective term for the archipelago, '''Oceani Insulae''' meaning ''Islands of the Ocean''. One such example is the ''[[Life of Saint Columba]]'', a [[hagiography]] recording the [[missionary]] activities of the [[sixth century]] Irish monk [[Saint Columba]] among the peoples of modern-day Scotland. It was written in the late seventh century by [[Adomnán of Iona|Adomnán]] of [[Iona]], an Irish monk living on the [[Inner Hebridean]] island.<ref>Book 2, 46 in the Sharpe edition = Book 2, 47 in Reeves edition.  The same name was used later by Heylyn as the term for all the islands in the North Atlantic. </ref> No ''Priteni''-derived collective reference is made.

[[Jordanes]] writing in [[Getica (Jordanes)|Getica]] (AD 551) describes ''Oceani insulas'' as an island group comprising of two large islands with the Isle of Man (''Menavia'') in between them, as well as the Orkneys (''Orcades'') and ''Thule'' (said to be the Shetlands or Iceland), with ''Thule'' being the furtherst north. While correctly placing these islands to the south of Scandinavia (''Scandia''), he also says that they are "not far from the neighborhood of the Strait of Gades" (southern Spain) and warns not to confuse them with "the twin promontories of Gallaecia and Lusitania" (in modern-say Portugal), as well as naming the larger of the islands Fortunate and the smaller Blessed, showing inspiration from the mythology of the [[Fortunate Isles]].<ref>Jordanes, [http://www.hieronymus.us/Goths/Goths1.htm Getica - De Origine Actibusque Gothorum], Chapter 1, section 7-9</ref>

Another early native source to use the term is the ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' of [[Bede]] written in the early eighth century. Bede's work does not explicitly give a collective term for the archipelago, referring to ''Brittania'' solely as the island "formerly called Albion" and treating Ireland separately.  As with Jordanes and Columba, however, he does refer to ''Oceani insula'', describing Britain as being one.<ref>Bede, Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation, Book I - In [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bede.html Latin] and [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/bede-book1.html English]</ref>

===British Isles===
[[Image:British Empire 1897.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The term ''British Isles'' came into use in English at the same time as the term ''British Empire.''  This map shows the British Isles (red) at the centre of the empire (pink) at its height in 1897 where England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales are referred to as the [[Home Nations]]]]

The sudden rediscovery of [[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Ptolemy's ''Geographia]]'' by [[Maximus Planudes]] in 1300 was a shock to European map-makers of the time.<ref>Jeppe Strandsbjerg, 2006, [http://www.bisa.ac.uk/2006/pps/strandsbjerg.pdf The Cartographic Production of Territory: mapping and Danish state formation 1450-1650], BISA Conference, University College Cork writes: "The translation of Ptolemy’s Geography into Latin in 1409 is frequently named as the symbolic beginning of this process because it (re-)introduced the principles that inform scientific cartography to Western Europe."</ref><ref>Utpal Mukhopadhyay, [http://www.ias.ac.in/resonance/Mar2005/pdf/Mar2005p08-18.pdf Mercator and his Map], Renonance, March, 2005 ("The Geographia of Ptolemy contained a world map and twenty six other maps. However, the book soon disappeared into oblivion, resulting in a deterioration in the art of mapmaking. With its rediscovery in the 15th century, and the subsequent discovery of printing and engraving techniques, there was a revival in the art of mapmaking. In the 16th century, publication of maps became a lucrative business. However, as regards distortion in shape and distance, these maps were of the same standardas that of Ptolemy's map. The person who liberated mapmaking from the influence of Ptolemy was Gerhard Mercator.")</ref>  The maps contained therein were far beyond what was known at the time and soon-after many copies began to be circulated, with Ptolemy's naming of ''Britannica'' being translated into Latin.<ref>[http://www.gwu.edu/gelman/spec/researchguides/bibliographies/holy_land_maps.pdf Maps of the Holy Land in Special Collections], The George Washington University ("With the expansion of Western power came Europe’s rediscovery of Claudius Ptolemy’s Geographia (150 AD), the earliest known atlas of the world.  Reprinted in 1477 it contained instructions on how to accurately illustrate the shape of the earth on a flat surface by using a curved grid of longitude and latitude.  However, many later cartographers simply copied Ptolomy’s work without copying his methods")</ref>

While, [[Britannia]] had remained the Latin name for Great Britain, after the fall of the Roman Empire it had lost most symbolic meaning until the rise of British influence and later, the [[British Empire]], which at its height, ruled a third of the world's population and a quarter of the world's landmass. With the death of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] in 1603 came the succession of her Scottish cousin, [[James VI of Scotland]] to the English throne. He would became [[James I of England]] and herald the personal unification of the Kingdoms of England (and the dominion of Wales) and Scotland. With the constitutional unification of these kingdoms in 1707 and the continued growth of British power and influence in the 1700s, Britannia became an increasingly important symbol and a strong rallying point among Britons.<ref>Kidd, C. 1999. British Identities before Nationalism: Ethnicity and Nationhood in the Atlantic World, 1600-1800. Cambridge, England, and New York: Cambridge University Press.</ref>

According to Frances Yates, [[John Dee]] used the term ''Brytish Iles'' in 1577 in his ''Memorials'',<ref>  John Dee, ''General and rare memorials pertayning to the Perfect Arte of Navigation'', London (1577), p.63; see''Queen Elizabeth as Astraea'', Frances A. Yates (Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol. 10, (1947), p.47</ref> a combination of a practical guide to navigation and a political polemic.   Dee is also attributed as coining the terms ''[[British Empire]]'' and ''[[British Ocean]]'' (a nautical region extending north-west from Britain, encompassing Iceland, Greenland and possibly as far as North America).  Current scholarly opinion is that most writers consider "his imperial vision was simply propaganda and antiquarianism."<ref>Ken MacMillan, 2001, "[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3686/is_200104/ai_n8932217/pg_1 Discourse on history, geography, and law: John Dee and the limits of the British empire, 1576-80]" in the Canadian Journal of History,  April 2001</ref>

However, the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] states that the first published use in English of "British Isles" was by [[Peter Heylin]] (or Heylyn) in his ''Microcosmus:  a little description of the great world'' in 1621,<ref>''Peter Heylyn'', Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed. Online Version (2000)</ref> a collection of his lectures on historical geography. He explains his use of the term with regard to ''Albion'' (modern-day Great Britain) on the basis that "ancient writers call this Iland a ''Brttiʃh Iland''". He extends this reasoning to include Ireland as a British Island also, citing that the 1st century Roman writer [[Tacitus]], who observed that the habits and disposition of the people in Ireland were not much unlike the "''Brittaines''".<ref>Peter Heylyn, ''Microcosmus'', p.502 (1621)</ref> Recent scholarly work questions Helwyn's credibility as a neutral scientist, explaining that, "Nationalism was something about which Heylyn was more explicit in ''Cosmographie'', his expanded rewriting of ''Microcosmus'' in the era of the Civil War, where he says, ‘as I have taken on my self the parts of an Historian and Geographer; so have I not forgotten that I [am] an English-man.’"<ref>Robert Mayhew, 2005, "[http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FBJH%2FBJH38_01%2FS0007087404006478a.pdf&code=8789cbc2d44877fcad870197ef071dd8 Mapping scienc's imagined community: geography as a Republic of Letters, 1600-1800]" in the British Journal of the History of Science, 38(1): 73-92, March 2005</ref>

While acknowledging that Heylyn "politicized his geographical books Microcosmus (1621) and, still more, Cosmographie", modern writers advise to judge this in terms of what geography was for the period:

{{cquote|In the period between 1600 and 1800, politics meant what we might now term "high politics," excluding the cultural and social elements that modern analyses of ideology seek to uncover. Politics referred to discussions of dynastic legitimacy, of representation, and of the Constitution. ...

Geography books spanning the period from the Reformation to the Reform Act ... demonstrated their authors' specific political identities by the languages and arguments they deployed. This cannot be seen as any deviation from the classical geographical tradition, or as a tainting of geography by politics, because geography was not to be conceived separately from politics.<ref>R.J. Mayhew, 2000, "Geography is Twinned with Divinity: The Laudian Geography of Peter Heylyn" in Geographical Review, Vol. 90, No. 1 (Jan., 2000), pp. 18-34</ref>}}

The description "British Isles", or its equivalent in Latin, also started to be used by mapmakers from the late 16th century onwards, for example [[Gerardus Mercator]].<ref>[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~genmaps/genfiles/COU_Pages/ENG_pages/aaEng.htm  Continental maps from the late XVI century].  Accessed 18 July 2006]</ref> Mercator, who leant heavily on his friend Dee as a source for his maps, was the most notable.  Similarly [[Ortelius]], in his atlas derived from Mercator´s original maps, uses the title ''"Angliae, Scotiae et Hiberniae, sive Britannicar. insularum descriptio"''. This translates as "A Representation of England, Scotland and Ireland, or Britannica's islands".<ref name = "GenMaps">[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~genmaps/genfiles/COU_files/ENG/aaEng/ortelius_anglia-scotia_1570.html  Anglia and Scotia], 1570, by Ortelius.</ref>  

Although other mapmakers (for example the Schagen Map<ref> Schagen Map, late 17th century from the University of Amsterdam [http://dpc2.uba.uva.nl/cgi/i/image/image-idx?sid=e55c1998f2bd0e1775d344dab7b7c2ce;med=1;q1=carto;rgn1=carto_all;size=20;c=carto;lasttype=boolean;view=entry;lastview=thumbnail;subview=detail;cc=carto;entryid=x-411329928;viewid=1806A19-11.TIF;start=61;resnum=73]
</ref>) continued to use descriptions like "Angliae, Scotiae et Hiberniae", the precedent set by Mercator and Ortelius (who were probably the most influential mapmakers of the period), meant that the term was very commonly used in maps by the late 17th century.{{fact}}

There are [[List of the British Isles by area|more than 6,000 islands]] in the group, the largest two being [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]]. Great Britain is to the east and covers 83,698&nbsp;square&nbsp;miles (216,777&nbsp;km²), over half of the total landmass of the group. Ireland is to the west and covers 32,589&nbsp;square&nbsp;miles (84,406&nbsp;km²). The largest of the other islands are to be found in the [[Hebrides]], [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] to the north, [[Anglesey]] and the Isle of Man between Great Britain and Ireland, and the [[Channel Islands]] near the coast of [[France]].

The [[Channel Islands]] are sometimes stated as being in the British Isles,<ref name = "Jerſey">[http://www.gov.je/  Jersey Government].</ref> though geographically they are not part of the island group, being close to the coast of [[France]].

The islands are at relatively low altitudes, with central Ireland and southern Great Britain particularly low lying. The [[Scottish Highlands]] in the northern part of Great Britain are mountainous, with [[Ben Nevis]] being the highest point in the British Isles at 1,344&nbsp;[[metres]] (4,409&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]). Other mountainous areas include Wales and parts of the island of Ireland, but only seven peaks in these areas reach above 1,000&nbsp;metres (3,281&nbsp;ft). Lakes on the islands are generally not large, although [[Lough Neagh]] in Northern Ireland is an exception, covering 147&nbsp;square&nbsp;miles (381&nbsp;km²); the largest freshwater body in Great Britain is [[Loch Lomond]] at 27.5&nbsp;square&nbsp;miles (71.1&nbsp;km²). Neither are rivers particularly long, the rivers [[River Severn|Severn]] at 219&nbsp;miles (354&nbsp;km) and [[River Shannon|Shannon]] at 240&nbsp;miles (386&nbsp;km) being the longest.

The British Isles have a [[temperate climate|temperate]] [[marine climate|marine]] climate, the [[North Atlantic Drift]] ("Gulf Stream") which flows from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] brings with it significant moisture and raises temperatures 11 degrees Celsius (20°[[Fahrenheit|F]]) above the global average for the islands' latitudes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mayes| first=Julian| coauthors=Dennis Wheeler| title=Regional Climates of the British Isles| year=1997| publisher=Routledge| location=London| pages=p. 13}}</ref> Winters are thus warm and wet, with summers mild and also wet. Most Atlantic [[Low pressure area|depressions]] pass to the north of the islands, combined with the general [[Westerlies|westerly circulation]] and interactions with the landmass, this imposes an east-west variation in climate.<ref><!--Mayes, ''Regional Climates of the British Isles''-->Ibid., pp. 13–14.</ref>

==Geology==
{{Mainarticle|Geology of the British Isles}}

An [http://www.bgs.ac.uk/education/makeamap/home.html interactive geological map] is available.  

The British Isles lie at the juncture of several regions with past episodes of [[tectonic]] mountain building. These [[Orogeny|orogenic belts]] form a complex geology which records a huge and varied span of earth history.<ref>{{cite book| last=Goudie| first=Andrew S.| coauthors=D. Brunsden| title=The Environment of the British Isles, an Atlas| year=1994| publisher=Clarendon Press| location=Oxford| pages=p. 2}}</ref> Of particular note was the [[Caledonian Orogeny]] during the [[Ordovician]] Period, ca. 488–444 [[Annum|Ma]] and early [[Silurian]] period, when the [[craton]] [[Baltica]] collided with the [[terrane]] [[Avalonia]] to form the mountains and hills in northern Britain and Ireland.  Baltica formed roughly the north western half of Ireland and Scotland.  Further collisions caused the [[Variscan orogeny]] in the [[Devonian]] and [[Carboniferous]] periods, forming the hills of [[Munster]], south-west England, and south Wales.  Over the last 500 million years the land which forms the islands has drifted northwest from around 30°S, crossing the [[equator]] around 370 million years ago to reach its present northern latitude.<ref><!--Goudie, ''The Environment of the British Isles, an Atlas''-->Ibid., p. 5.</ref> 

The islands have been shaped by numerous glaciations during the [[Quaternary Period]], the most recent being the [[Devensian]]. As this ended, the central [[Irish Sea]] was de-glaciated (whether or not there was a land bridge between Great Britain and Ireland at this time is somewhat disputed, though there was certainly a single ice sheet covering the entire sea) and the [[English Channel]] flooded, with sea levels rising to current levels some 4,000 to 5,000 years ago, leaving the British Isles in their current form.

The islands' geology is highly complex, though there are large amounts of [[limestone]] and [[chalk]] rocks which formed in the [[Permian]] and [[Triassic]] periods. The west coasts of Ireland and northern Great Britain that directly face the [[Atlantic Ocean]] are generally characterized by long [[peninsulas]], and headlands and bays; the internal and eastern coasts are "smoother".

==History==
{{UKHBS}}
{{History of Ireland}}
:''See also: [[History of the Isle of Man]], [[History of the Orkney Islands]].''

The British Isles has a long and complex shared history. While this tends to be presented in terms of national narratives, many events transcended modern political boundaries. In particular these borders have little relevance to early times and in that context can be misleading, though useful as an indication of location to the modern reader. Also, cultural shifts which historians have previously interpreted as evidence of invaders eliminating or displacing the previous populations are now, in the light of genetic evidence, perceived by a number of archaeologists and historians as being to a considerable extent changes in the culture of the existing population brought by groups of immigrants or invaders who at times became a new ruling élite.

===Prehistory===
At a time when the islands were still joined to continental Europe, ''[[Homo erectus]]'' brought [[Palaeolithic]] tool use to the south east of the modern British Isles some 750,000 years ago followed (about 500,000 years ago) by the more advanced tool use of ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' found at [[Boxgrove]]. It appears that the [[glacier|glaciation]] of [[ice age]]s successively cleared all human life from the area, though human occupation occurred during warmer interglacial periods. Modern humans appear with the [[Aurignacian]] culture about 30,000 years ago, famously with the "[[Red Lady of Paviland]]" in modern Wales. The last ice age ended around 10,000 years ago, and [[Mesolithic]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s spread to all parts of the islands by around 8,000 years ago, at a time when rising sea levels now cut off the islands from the continent. The immigrants came principally from the ice age refuge in what is now the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]], with a smaller immigration from refuges in the modern [[Ukraine]] and [[Moldavia]]. Three quarters of the ancestors of people of the British Isles may have arrived in this wave of immigration.<ref>Stephen Oppenheimer, ''Myths of British Ancestry'', Prospect, Issue 127, p.50 (Oct. 2006)</ref>

Around 6,500 years ago farming practices spread to the area with the [[Neolithic Revolution]] and the western seaways quickly brought [[megalithic]] culture throughout the islands. The earliest stone house still standing in northern Europe is at [[Knap of Howar]], in Orkney which also features such monuments as [[Maes Howe]] ranking alongside the [[Callanish stone circle]] on the Isle of Lewis, [[Newgrange]] in Ireland, and [[Stonehenge]] in southern England along with thousands of lesser monuments across the isles, often showing affinities with megalithic monuments in France and Spain.<ref>[http://www.britarch.ac.uk/BA/ba63/feat2.shtml British Archaeology Magazine - People of the Sea] article by [[Barry Cunliffe]]</ref> Further cultural shifts in the [[Bronze Age]] were followed  with the building of numerous [[hill fort]]s in the [[Iron Age]], and increased trade with continental Europe.

===Pretani, Romans and Anglo-Saxons===
The oldest surviving historical records of the islands preserve fragments of the travels of the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Pytheas]] around 320&nbsp;BC and describe Great Britain and Ireland as the islands of ''Prettanike'' with their peoples the ''Priteni'' or ''Pretani'', a name which may have been used in [[Gaul]]. A later variation on this term as the ''[[Cruithne (people)|Cruithne]]'' would come to refer to certain groups. Ireland was referred to as ''Ierne'' (the ''sacred island'' as the Greeks interpreted it) "inhabited by the race of ''Hiberni''", and Great Britain as ''insula Albionum'', "island of the Albions". These terms without the collective name appear in the [[4th century]] writings of [[Avienus]] which preserve fragments of the  [[Massaliote Periplus]] of the [[6th century BC]].<ref name=snyder>{{cite book

They perceived these languages as arriving in a series of invasions, but modern evidence suggests that these peoples may have migrated from [[Anatolia]] around 7000&nbsp;BC through southern and then western Europe.<ref name = "Oppenheimer">Oppenheimer, ''ibid.''</ref> Genetic evidence indicates that there was not a later large-scale replacement of these early inhabitants<ref>B.McEvoy, M.Richards, P.Forster, and D.G.

[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1182057]</ref> and that the Celtic influence was largely cultural.  In the [[Scottish highlands]] northwards the people the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] called [[Caledonians]] or [[Picts]] spoke a language which is now unknown. It is also possible that southern England was settled by Belgic tribes.<ref name = "Oppenheimer" />

During the first century the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] established [[Roman Britain]] which became a province of the [[Roman Empire]] named ''Britannia'', eventually extending on the island of Great Britain to [[Hadrian's Wall]] with tribes forming friendly [[buffer state]]s further north to around the [[Firth of Clyde]] and the [[Firth of Forth]], and military expeditions beyond that into [[Caledonia]]. The interaction of the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] with Ireland appears to have largely been limited to some trade. From the 4th century raids on Roman Britain increased and language links have led to speculation that many Britons migrated across the [[English Channel]] at this time to found [[Brittany]], but it has been contended that [[Armorica]] was already Brittonic speaking  due to trade and religious links, and the Romans subsequently called it  ''Brittania''.<ref name=snyder/>

The departure of the Romans around 410 left numerous kingdoms across the British Isles.  Settlement in [[Sub-Roman Britain]] by peoples traditionally called the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], and [[Jutes]] created [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdoms ("the [[Heptarchy]]") over much of what is now England and [[Gododdin|south-east Scotland]]. To the north, the Irish [[Dál Riata]]ns, also known by the name [[Gaels|Scotti]] expanded their influence to western Scotland.

===National formation===
The [[Vikings]] arrived in Britain and Ireland in the 790's with raids on [[Lindisfarne]], [[Iona]], and the west of Ireland.  They provided another wave of immigration, settling in Orkney and Shetland and then [[Western Isles]], [[Caithness]], [[Sutherland]], [[Isle of Man]],  [[Galloway]], in various places around Ireland, [[Northumbria]], [[East Anglia]] and [[Mercia]].  [[Wessex]] prevented the further expansion of the Vikings, and achieved a united [[kingdom of England]] in 927, which was then ruled by both English and Viking kings until [[Battle of Stamford Bridge|1066]].  Further north, in 900&nbsp;A.D. [[Domnall II of Scotland|Donald II]] was the first [[Kingdom of Alba|king of Alba]] rather than king of the Picts.  His successors amalgamated all the kingdoms north of England into the kingdom of Alba and fixed its southern border on the [[River Tweed|Tweed]] in [[1018]]. Wales was divided into a number of British kingdoms, apart from one short period of unification, and also suffered from Viking raids in the tenth century.  [[Early Medieval Ireland 800–1166|Ireland]] was divided among around eighty to a hundred petty kingdoms grouped under larger regional kingdoms and then a weak [[High King of Ireland|High King]].  The Vikings founded [[Dublin]] in 852 and established several other coastal strongholds around Ireland.  The Viking kingdom of Dublin went on to dominate much of Ireland{{fact}}, but their power was broken by [[Brian Boru]] in [[1014]] who effectively united Ireland, but only until his death.

===Norman immigration===
The next wave of immigration were Viking descendants, the [[Normans]].  The [[Norman Conquest]] of [[1066]] brought England under their rule and then extended their influence and power to the rest of the British Isles.  The Normans were centralisers and expansionists.  Their lands (and those of their successors, the [[Plantagenets]]) within the British Isles were part of more extensive land holdings in France and elsewhere, and held within a feudal framework.  They controlled [[History of Wales#Wales and the Normans: 1067 - 1282|Wales]] by the end of the 11th century, only to partially lose it again several times owing to revolts until 1283 when [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] successfully enforced [[Plantagenet]] supremacy.  In [[1072]] the Normans forced the Scottish king [[Máel Coluim III of Scotland|Malcolm III]] to submit to their feudal overlordship, something they would regularly assert during the mediaeval period. The Normans did not supplant the Scottish political structure, but had great influence over it, eventually supplying the [[Scotland in the High Middle Ages#Scoto-Norman kings: David I to Alexander III|kings of the Scots]] from 1150, and then [[Wars of Scottish Independence|asserting independence]] of the Scottish Crown from that of England.  The Scottish Crown gradually gained control of Norse areas, annexing the [[Kingdom of Mann and the Isles|kingdoms of Mann and of the Isles]] in 1266, and Orkney and Shetland from [[Norway]] in 1472.  The Normans were initially  [[Norman Ireland#The Coming of the Normans|invited to Ireland]], here they asserted overlordship,  resulting in 1184 with the Pope authorising the feudal [[Lordship of Ireland]].  This fell under the English crown with the accession of [[King John of England|John]]. Formal taxation and government during the middle ages was generally restricted to an arc around Dublin called the [[Pale]].  

During the [[Middle Ages]], the Normans slowly intermarried with the previous populations and adopted their language and customs.  In England, the anglicisation of the Norman and Plantagenet elite was driven by the slow erosion of their lands elsewhere, but it was 1362 before the ''[[Langues d'oïl|Langue d'oïl]]'', [[Anglo-Norman Language|Anglo-Norman]] gave way to [[Middle English]] to become the language of the law courts.

===Protestant reformation and civil wars===
The feudal system decayed and by the end of the sixteenth century was replaced by a system of centralised states.  The English throne had come under the Welsh [[Tudors]], who centralised government in England,  [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], and  [[Laws in Wales Acts|Wales]].  In 1603 [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland]] brought England and Scotland into [[Union of the Crowns|personal union]] and promoted the existence of a modern British identity.  

These changes happened at the same time as the [[Protestant reformation]] where the Roman Catholic church had been replaced by national churches to which all people were expected to adhere to.  Failure to do so resulted in prosecution for [[recusancy]] and heavy fines, and recusants laid themselves open to accusations of treason and loss of land.  By 1600 there was a wide range of religious belief within the islands from [[Presbyterian]] Calvinists (who were the majority in much of Scotland) and [[Congregational Church|Independents]] to episcopal Calvinists (in the [[Church of Ireland]] and parts of Scotland)  to Protestant Episcopalians that retained formal liturgy (especially the  [[Church of England]]) to Roman Catholicism (which retained a large majority in Ireland).   

James, and his son, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], favoured political and religious centralisation and uniformity throughout the British Isles. They favoured  episcopal, [[Arminianism|Armininian]] churches with a formal liturgy, which antagonised many Protestants. In addition, James, although he followed a policy of relative religious toleration, worsened the position of Irish Catholics by expanding the policy of [[Plantations of Ireland|plantation]] in Ireland, most notably in the [[Plantation of Ulster]] where forfeited lands from Catholics were settled by Scottish and English Protestants and by barring Catholics from serving in public office. Charles tried to force central, personal government. He attempted to bypass institutions he could not control and impose a uniform non-Calivinistic settlement throughout the islands.

The result was the [[Bishops Wars#First Bishops' War (1639)|First Bishops War]] in Scotland in 1639, when the Scottish Presbyterians rebelled against Charles' religious policies. The crisis rapidly spread to Ireland, in the form of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] and then to England, where Parliament refused to raise an army for Charles to fight in Scotland or Ireland, fearing that it would next be used against them. the [[English Civil War]] broke out in 1642. Collectively, these conflicts are known as the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], a shifting series of conflicts and alliances within Britain and Ireland.  The King's supporters were known as the Royalists and had forces in England, Scotland (mostly episcopalian and Catholic [[Scottish Highlands|highlanders]]), and Ireland. The English Parliamentary forces (mostly presbyterian and independents) fought against them, but were defeated in England by 1645. The Scottish presbyterians (the [[Covenanter]]s) were allied to the English Paliament, while the Irish Catholic [[Confederate Ireland|Confederates]] were loosely allied with the Royalists. 

By 1649 Parliamentary forces ruled England and executed Charles and the Covenanters had secured Scotland. An alliance between the Catholic Confederates and the Royalists in Ireland resulted in the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|parliamentary conquest of  Ireland]], followed by a brutal guerilla campaign which officially ended in 1653.  [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] repudiated the Irish alliance in 1650 in order to enter one with the Covenanters instead and invaded England. He was defeated in 1651 and the result was that the entire British Isles were brought under the English parliamentary army.  There was religious toleration of Protestant denominations (though no episcopalian church), but Catholics were strongly repressed.  In Ireland they were disenfranchised and dispossessed with Catholic land ownership dropping from 60% to 8% and their land was confiscated to pay off the Parliament's debts. Some of the land was given to another wave of Protestant immigrants, especially former soldiers, but these were not sufficient to replace the existing Irish, so Ireland became a land largely owned by Protestant landlords with Catholic tenants.

===The return of the Stuarts===
The restoration of Charles II in 1660 reversed many of the [[English Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] measures:  the three kingdoms were separated again, the episcopalian Churches of England and Ireland re-established, a Presbyterian Church of Scotland established, and Protestant [[nonconformism]] repressed.  A small proportion of the confiscated lands in Ireland were restored, bringing Catholic ownership up to 20%.  In1685 brought Charles' brother, [[James II of England|James II]], a Catholic, to the thrones.  James [[Declaration of Indulgence|suspended]] the laws discriminating against those not adhering to the national churches; but, he attempted personal rule with a large standing army and heavy-handedly attempted to replace Anglicans with Catholics.  This alienated the English establishment who invited the Dutch [[William III of England|William, Prince of Orange]] to depose James in favour of his daughter, [[Mary II of England|Mary]].  On William's landing, James fled first to France and then to Ireland where the  government remained loyal to him.  Here he was defeated, and the position of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] cemented with the imposition of [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] there  that effectively denied nearly all Catholics (75% of the population) any sort of power or substantial property.  

James and his descendants attempted to recover the throne [[Jacobite risings|several times]] over the next sixty years, but failed to gain sufficient active support and were consistently defeated.  

===Kingdom of Great Britain and social revolutions===

The [[1707]] [[Act of Union 1707|Act of Union]] united England and Scotland in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. The next century saw the start of great social changes.  [[Enclosure]] had been taking place over a long period in England, but the [[agricultural revolution]] accelerated the process by which land was privatised, commercialised, and intensively exploited, and caused it to spread throughout the British Isles.  This resulted in the displacement of large numbers of people from the land and widespread hardship.  In addition, the [[industrial revolution]] saw the displacement of cottage industries by large-scale factories and the rapid growth of industrial towns and cities.  The  [[British Empire]] grew substantially, stoking the growth in industrial production, bringing in wealth, giving rise to large-scale emigration, and making [[London]] the largest city in Europe.  

Social unrest and repressive government accompanied these upheavals.  The ideals of the [[French Revolution]] were widely supported and led to a full-scale [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]] in Ireland.  A result of the rebellion was the start of the end of Ascendancy hegemony in Ireland and its political [[Act of Union 1800|unification]] with Great Britain in 1801.  Unrest throughout the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland continued well into the 19th century, but was increasingly legitimised and able to find an outlet in Parliament from the [[Great Reform Act]] of 1832 onwards.  The role of religion in determining political markedly decreased from the [[Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Act]] in 1829 onwards.  The social upheavals continued with widespread migration from the countryside to towns and cities and abroad.  Ireland suffered a great [[Irish Potato Famine (1845–1849)|famine]] from 1845 until 1849 which resulted in its population dropping by a third through death and migration.  This included large-scale movements to Great Britain, especially to the north west of England and western Scotland.  Emigration from the whole of the British Isles overseas continued, especially to the English-speaking parts of the British Empire, the United States, and other countries such as [[Argentina]].

===The 20th century===

Prosperity increased through the 19th and into the 20th century, and politics became increasingly popular and democratic.  The suspension of the Home Rule Act 1914, the subsequent Easter Rising, and the [[Anglo-Irish War|Irish War of Independence]] led to the [[1921]]/[[1922]] formation of the [[Irish Free State]] and [[Northern Ireland]], thus more than reversing the 1801 Act of Union. The [[Irish Civil War]] which followed the Anglo-Irish Treaty had no impact on constitutional arrangements between Great Britain and Ireland since the anti-Treaty side was defeated. 

The Irish Free State held [[dominion]] status until 1937, finally becoming the [[Republic of Ireland|republic]] in 1949.  

The six Irish counties which remained part of the United Kingdom as [[Northern Ireland]] had a devolved government from 1922 until the late 1960s {{fact}}, when direct rule was reimposed from London.   There have been extensive periods of [[The Troubles|unrest]] in Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland has seen several re-impositions of direct rule in the subsequent decades as the parties within Northern Ireland fail to reach practical agreement on power sharing.    

During [[World War II]], the Irish Free State stayed officially neutral. Although much practical assistance was given to the allied side, the Irish Government at the time felt it impossible to join the British side in the conflict.

Both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland joined the European Economic Community (now the [[European Union]]) in 1973.  

Within the United Kingdom there are [[devolution|devolved]] governments in [[Welsh Assembly|Wales]] and [[Scottish Parliament|Scotland]], though in Northern Ireland the [[Northern Ireland Assembly|devolved assembly]] is still suspended.  

Further waves of migration from Ireland to Great Britain took place during times of economic difficulty in Ireland in the thirties, forties, and fifties, though since then Ireland has grown more prosperous and the Irish [[Gross Domestic Product]] ''per capita'' now exceeds that of the United Kingdom.  

The end of the [[British Empire]] in the latter half of the 20th century saw the end of large-scale emigration from Great Britain; instead, there was new non-Irish immigration to Great Britain, especially from the [[West Indies]] and the Indian sub-continent. 

Recently, with the accession of Poland and other former Communist states to the European Union, there has been significant immigration to both Britain and Ireland from eastern [[Europe]].

==Sport and Culture==

A number of sports have strong ties to one or other of the islands of the British Isles, through either having been invented there or their rules being first formalized by associations there. 

Examples include globally popular games include [[Association football|football]], [[tennis]] and [[golf]], all either invented or formalized in Great Britain, although golf actually originated in Flanders and The Netherlands.   Other games, while not commanding the same global popularly, draw pan-global support, such as [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[cricket]], and [[darts]], all invented or formalised in England.  

[[American handball|Handball]] is a derivative or variant of [[Gaelic Handball]], with the first records of play in Scotland in 1427 <ref> http://www.ushandball.org/content/view/451/243/ </ref>.   [[Baseball]] is widely believed to have originated from the British and Irish game of rounders - although this view has been challenged in recent years<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref>  - and is broadly similar to the version of [[rounders]] played in Ireland.   [[Shinty]] is considered one of the many forebearers of [[ice hockey]], along with [[hockey]], [[hurling]], [[bandy]] and several other stick games.

There are several sports popular in [[Ireland]] that are not in [[Great Britian]], and vice versa. [[Cricket]], [[hurling]] and [[Gaelic football]] are probably the best examples of this.  Cricket, while being very popular in England and Wales, is rare in Scotland and Ireland.  Similarly, hurling and Gaelic football, although hugely popular across the island of Ireland and capable of regularly filling the 82,500-capacity [[Croke Park]], the 4th largest stadium in Europe, are almost unknown in Great Britain.   

However, for some sports a common level of popularity is shared across the islands. Football (the term soccer, common in [[American English]], is also sometimes used for the sport in the British Isles) is hugely popular in both Great Britain and Ireland, as in the rest of the world. 

The organization of football across Great Britain and Ireland is split into five independent national associations and national teams, one for the Republic of Ireland and four for the United Kingdom. Football in the Republic of Ireland is governed by [[Football Association of Ireland]]; Northern Ireland by the [[Irish Football Association]]; Wales by the [[Football Association of Wales]]; Scotland by the [[Scottish Football Association]]; and England by the [[Football Association]]. The four United Kingdom associations are, alongside [[FIFA]], the members of the [[International Football Association Board]], who decide upon the ''[[Laws of the Game]]''.

Some sporting events do operate across Great Britain and Ireland as a whole. 

The [[British and Irish Lions]] is a [[rugby union]] team made up of players from the entire archipelago and which undertakes tours of the [[Southern Hemisphere]] rugby playing nations every few years.  This team was formerly known as The British Isles or colloquially as "The British Lions", but was renamed as "The British and Irish Lions" in 2001, apparently because of objections in Ireland to the team being named "The British Isles".

Both Northern Ireland and the Republic are represented by [[Ireland national rugby union team|one united team]]. 

The [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]] [[rugby union|rugby]] championship originated as a championship between the nations of the British Isles in 1883.  France participated in 4 of the "Home International Championships" championships prior to 1910 and then continuously from 1910, originating the term "The Five Nations" in that year.  The event was extended to include [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]], becoming the [[Six Nations Championship]], in the year 2000. However, if any of the nations from Great Britain and Ireland beat the other three within the Six Nations tournament, they are still awarded the [[Triple Crown (Rugby Union)|Triple Crown]]. 

Since 2001 the professional club teams of Ireland, Scotland and Wales compete together in the [[Celtic League (rugby union)|Celtic League]].  Clubs in the English [[Guinness Premiership]] do not participate in the Celtic League.

Between 1927 and 1971 the [[Ryder Cup]] in golf was played between a [[United States]] team and a [[Great Britain]] team, although, in practice, a team representing Great Britain and Ireland.  In 1973, the team was renamed so that [[United States]] faced an official Great Britain and Ireland team.  From 1979 onwards this was expanded to include the whole of [[Europe]].  [[Bowls]] is also an example of a sport that continues to have a British Isles championship.

As with sport, there are only a few cultural activities that are experienced in common across the two islands. The United Kingdom and Ireland have separate [[television]] and [[radio]] networks. However, many people in Ireland watch British television, which is widely available <ref> http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/I/htmlI/ireland/ireland.htm </ref>, giving people in Ireland a high level of familiarity with cultural matters in Great Britain.  Irish television is not widely available in Great Britain {{cn}}.  British newspapers and magazine are widely read in Ireland and in recent decades have started to produce specific Ireland-orientated editorial copy {{cn}}.  Again, as with television, the reverse is not true and Irish newspapers are only available in a few selected locations.

A few activities are presented as being applicable to both Great Britain and Ireland.  For example, the [[Costa Book Awards]], formerly the Whitbread Awards, are awarded to authors resident in the UK or Ireland. The [[Man Booker Prize]] is awarded to authors from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] or the Republic of Ireland. The [[Mercury Music Prize]] is handed out every year to the best album from a British or Irish musician or group, though other musical awards are considered on a national basis; for example, [[U2]] won the best international group award at the [[Brit Awards|2001 Brit awards]].

Other organisations are sometimes organised across the islands; for example the [[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]].
