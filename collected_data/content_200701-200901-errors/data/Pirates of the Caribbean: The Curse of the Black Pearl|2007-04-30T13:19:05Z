==Plot==
{{spoiler}}
As governer [[Weatherby Swann]] and his 12-year-old daughter, [[Elizabeth Swann|Elizabeth]] sail to [[Port Royal]], [[Jamaica]], their ship, HMS ''[[Dauntless (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Dauntless]]'' happen upon a shipwreck and its sole survivor, the young [[Will Turner]]. Elizabeth discovers a gold skull medallion around the unconscious Will's neck. Fearing he will be arrested as a pirate, she takes and hides it. As she does this, she glimpses a ship with tattered black sails disappearing into the mist. 

Eight years later, [[James Norrington|Captain James Norrington]] of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[Royal Navy]] is promoted to [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]]. At his ceremony, he proposes to Elizabeth, but before she can answer, she faints and tumbles off a wall and into the bay. The skull medallion she is wearing emits a mysterious pulse through the water. Meanwhile, pirate [[Captain Jack Sparrow]] has arrived in Port Royal.  While talking to two members of the royal navy on HMS ''Interceptor'', he sees Elizabeth fall into the bay and rescues her. He is promptly arrested for piracy, but escapes and ducks into a blacksmith shop. There he encounters Will Turner, now a blacksmith's apprentice and self-taught expert swordsman. Following a swordfight with Turner, Sparrow is knocked unconscious by the blacksmith, Mr. Brown, and jailed.

That night, Port Royal is besieged by the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' — a pirate ghost ship.  The mysterious pulse from Elizabeth's medallion ''called'' to them.  The pirates ransack the town seeking the medallion. Elizabeth is captured and invokes [[parley]]&mdash;an agreement ensuring one's safety until meeting and negotiating with the opposing side.  To protect her identity, Elizabeth tells Captain [[Hector Barbossa]] her last name is "Turner". She persuades the pirates to cease the attack on Port Royal in exchange for the medallion, but employing a loophole in their negotiation, Barbossa keeps Elizabeth prisoner.
[[Image:Carib8.JPG|left|thumb|225px|Jack and Will prepare to commandeer the ''Interceptor''.]] 
Unable to convince [[James Norrington|Commodore Norrington]] to take immediate action, Will persuades Jack Sparrow to help him rescue Elizabeth in exchange for freeing him from jail. After hijacking HMS ''[[Interceptor (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Interceptor]]'' Jack and Will recruit a crew in [[Tortuga]] with help from Jack's friend, [[Joshamee Gibbs|Gibbs]]. They set sail for [[Isla de Muerta]], the mysterious island Jack knows the pirates will go to to break the curse. While en route, Will learns the ''Black Pearl'' was formerly commanded by Sparrow. When Jack shared the bearings to a hidden chest of [[Aztec]] [[gold]] coins, First Mate Barbossa instigated a [[mutiny]] and [[marooned]] Jack on a small island. Jack escaped three days later. The pirates found and spent the treasure but soon learned it was cursed&mdash;leaving them as immortal skeletal beings whose true forms are only revealed in moonlight. The curse can only be lifted when every coin and some of each pirate's blood is returned to the chest. [["Bootstrap Bill" Turner]] sent a coin to his son, William, believing the crew should remain cursed for what they did to Jack.  Barbossa then ordered Bootstrap tied to a cannon and thrown overboard only to realize later his blood was also needed to break the curse; a Turner kin must now take his place. Believing Elizabeth is Bootstrap's child, Barbossa poises her over the Aztec chest, anoints the last coin with her [[blood]] and drops it into the chest&mdash;the curse remains in effect. 

On the island, Will suspects Sparrow may betray him and knocks him out in the cave by hitting him over the head with an oar. He rescues Elizabeth, and they escape to the ''Interceptor''. Jack barters with Barbossa&mdash;in exchange for revealing Bootstrap's real child, he wants to captain the ''Black Pearl''.  Jack's negotiations come to naught, however, when the ''Pearl'' pursues the ''Interceptor'', sinking her and taking the crew captive. Will reveals that he is Bootstrap Bill's true offspring and demands that Elizabeth and the crew be freed. Otherwise, he threatens to shoot himself and fall overboard, lost forever. Barbossa agrees but craftily applies another loophole and strands Elizabeth and Jack on a deserted island (the same island that Jack was marrooned on ten years before). Will is taken back to Isla de Muerta for the ritual. To speed their rescue, Elizabeth burns a cache of abandoned rum to create a signal fire that is spotted by Norrington. She convinces Norrington to rescue Will by accepting his earlier marriage proposal. Arriving at the island, Norrington sets an ambush outside the cave while Jack goes inside and persuades Barbossa to form an alliance. He tells him to delay breaking the curse until after they have taken the ''[[Dauntless (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Dauntless]]'' and killed the crew. Jack then sneaks a coin from the chest, rendering himself immortal. But whatever Jack's actual intent is, his plan goes awry when Barbossa orders his crew to infiltrate the ''[[Dauntless (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Dauntless]]'' from underwater.  Jack's true allegiance is revealed when he suddenly attacks and then shoots Barbossa. Jack tosses his bloodied coin to Will who returns the last two medallions to the chest, breaking the curse.  No longer immortal, the fatally wounded Barbossa falls dead. Realizing they are no longer cursed, the now-mortal pirates surrender to the navy.

Back in Port Royal, Jack is about to be executed. Believing Jack does not deserve death, Will rescues him. Both are quickly captured, but Elizabeth lends her support and declares her love for Will. Norrington releases her from their engagement, and Will is pardoned; meanwhile, Jack escapes by falling into the [[ocean]]. His crew, who escaped with the ''Black Pearl'', rescue him. Norrington is impressed enough to allow him one day's head start before giving pursuit. Following [[Post-credits scene|the end credits]], in a final scene on Isla de Muerta, Barbossa's pet monkey takes a piece of the treasure and is cursed once again, explaining its immortality in ''Dead Man's Chest.

==Production==
[[Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]] wrote the screenplay and pitched it to Disney in the early 90s, but it was rejected. Somehow [[Steven Speilberg]](whose all time favorite ride at Disneyland is the Pirates of the Carribean ride) got a hold of the script and very much wanted to do it. His three choices for the role of Captain Jack Sparrow were [[Bill Murray]], [[Steve Martin]] or [[Robin Williams]], Disney however did not give permission.

In the early years of this decade Elliot and Rossio pitched the idea again and this time Disney did not reject it.

When production for the film was first announced in early [[2002]], movie fans and critics were skeptical of its chances of success; the concept of Disney basing a movie upon one of its own theme-park rides seemed to many a crass marketing ploy.  Additionally, the genre of [[pirate]]-themed movies had seen a string of big-budget flops (''[[Cutthroat Island]]'', and ''[[Treasure Planet]]'', among others).

The lead character is pirate [[Captain Jack Sparrow]], played by [[Johnny Depp]]. Among the actors also considered for the role were [[Jim Carrey]], [[Christopher Walken]] and [[Michael Keaton]]; professional wrestler [[Kurt Angle]] auditioned for the role.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

In the film he befriends [[Will Turner]], played by [[Orlando Bloom]].  Actors considered for the role include [[Jude Law]],  [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Tobey Maguire]], [[Christopher Masterson]] and [[Christian Bale]].

==Reception==
Critics were pleasantly surprised to find the film an enjoyable [[swashbuckler]], and the movie became a huge box-office success, grossing $305 million in [[North America]] alone, and over $650 million worldwide. Critics in particular praised [[Johnny Depp]] for his performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. It has been voted onto [[IMDb]]'s "top 250 films of all-time" list by its users<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.imdb.com/chart/top| title = 238. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) | publisher = IMDb| work = Top 250 movies as voted by our users | accessdate = 2006-07-11}}</ref>. The film also received five [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations: [[Academy Award for Makeup|Best Makeup]], [[Academy Award for Sound|Best Sound]], [[Academy Award for Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], [[Academy Award for Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], and a surprise [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] nomination for [[Johnny Depp]]. [[Roger Ebert]] claimed the film "came into your homes... and overstayed its welcome." Despite giving a positive review, Ebert claims it was just a little too long with lots of unnecessary plotlines.

[[Johnny Depp]] was nominated at the [[76th Academy Awards]] for his portrayal of [[Captain Jack Sparrow]], though he lost the award to [[Sean Penn]] in ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]''. ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'' was also nominated for Achievement in Makeup, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, and Visual Effects, but did not win in any of those categories. At the [[Golden Globe]]s, ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'' was nominated for acting (Depp), but lost to [[Bill Murray]] in ''[[Lost in Translation]]''.  Johnny Depp won the [[Screen Actors Guild]] Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role for his performance as Jack Sparrow.

==Home release==
