'''Mackinac Island''' ([[IPA chart for English|pronounced]] {{IPA|[ˈmækɪˌnɔː]}}, like MACK-in-aw, note the silent "c") is a small island, 9.779&nbsp;km² (3.776&nbsp;mi²) in land area, in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]]. It is located in [[Lake Huron]], at the eastern end of the [[Straits of Mackinac]], which lie between the state's [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper]] and [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsulas]]. The island's strategic position amidst the commerce of the [[fur trade]] of the [[Great Lakes]] led to the establishment of [[Fort Mackinac]] on the island by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. It was the scene of two strategic battles during the [[War of 1812]]. 

In the late [[19th century]] the island became a popular tourist attraction and [[summer colony]].  It continues to be famous for its lack of automobiles and its [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] resort hotels, especially the [[Grand Hotel (Mackinac Island)|Grand Hotel]] with its 201&nbsp;m (660&nbsp;ft) long front porch. Of the island's total area, over 82 percent is preserved as [[Mackinac Island State Park]]. 

==Description==
[[Image:British-Landing-Plaque.jpg|thumb|left|Historical Marker at British Landing]]
The city of [[Mackinac Island, Michigan|Mackinac Island]] occupies the entire island as well as all of [[Round Island (Michigan)|Round Island]], which sits across the passage just to the south. (Round Island is currently uninhabited and is owned by the [[United States Forest Service|U.S. Forest Service]] in its entirety, part of the [[Hiawatha National Forest]].)

The island has a year-round population of 523 persons ([[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]]), mostly in the historic community located on the southern tip and in the community of "Harrisonville" farther inland. The population grows considerably in the resort season, when it is crowded with tourists, accommodating an average of 15,000 people per day.  The highest point of the island is the historic Fort George (since 1815 officially called Fort Holmes), which is 97&nbsp;m (320&nbsp;ft) above the lake level and about 270&nbsp;m (890&nbsp;ft) above sea level. 
The [[Mackinac Bridge]] dominates the view from the west side of the island.

Mackinac Island is accessible by private boats, by ferry, and by small planes. The airport has a 1,070&nbsp;m (3,500&nbsp;ft) paved runway, and charter air service from the mainland is available. In the summer tourist season, three separate ferry services shuttle visitors to the island from [[St. Ignace, Michigan|St. Ignace]] and [[Mackinaw City, Michigan|Mackinaw City]]. During the winter months when the lake is frozen, the island is sometimes accessible by [[snowmobile]]. Residents take their [[Christmas tree]]s to British Landing (the site of an [[1812]] assault on the fort), and place them along a route marking relatively safe ice.

Motorized vehicles are [[Auto-free zones|prohibited]] on the island with the exception of emergency vehicles, service vehicles, and, during the winter, snowmobiles.  Travel on the island is by foot, bicycle, or horse-drawn carriage. Bicycles, carriages, and saddle horses are available for rent, although inexperienced carriage drivers and riders are advised to avoid busy town areas. An 8 mile (13 km) long road rings the island and numerous roads, trails and paths cover the interior.  The road encircling the island and most closely hugging the shoreline is [[M-185 (Michigan highway)|M-185]], one of the few highways in the United States without motorized vehicles.

The island is famous for the multiple candy shops that line the streets of the village.  The most popular items at these stores are the locally-produced "Mackinac Island [[fudge]]" and [[taffy (candy)|taffy]], leading to the popular nickname of visiting shoppers as "fudgies". Spring brings a popular [[Lilac]] Festival to the island.  News stories are covered by the local weekly ''[[Mackinac Island Town Crier]]''.

The island has a significant number of [[hotel]] and [[bed and breakfast]] rooms for overnight guests, and some cottages for rent.  No camping is allowed on the island.

==History==

The island was at the center of a thriving [[fur trade|fur industry]] beginning in the 17th century and lasting into the early 19th century. The Mackinaw Fur Company was merged with the Southwestern Fur Company by [[John Jacob Astor]] to form his [[American Fur Company]]. 

The island changed hands from the [[France|French]] to the [[Great Britain|British]] after the [[French and Indian War]].  The British controlled the island for a time after the [[American Revolutionary War]] and built and garrisoned [[Fort Mackinac]] in 1781.  The British relinquished Fort Mackinac to the United States in 1796 but maintained a military presence nearby at [[St. Joseph Island]] in Lake Huron.  The British continued to exert a strong influence over the area between 1796 and 1812, and maintained friendships with local native tribes.  A British detachment from St. Joseph Island captured the fort in the first engagement of the [[War of 1812]] and held it against subsequent American attacks until the end of the war, when it was returned to the U.S. by the [[Treaty of Ghent]] in 1815.  

In 1875, much of the island was designated as [[Mackinac National Park]], the second national park of the United States (after [[Yellowstone National Park]], created three years earlier). When Fort Mackinac was decommissioned in 1895, the land was given to the state of Michigan and it became Michigan's first state park, Mackinac Island State Park.

===Name===

The name of the island has been shortened from "[[Michilimackinac]]".  One interpretation of this name is that it means "great in number of turtle" in the [[Anishinaabe language|Ottawa and Chippewa language]], though more likely the name came from the [[Menominee language]].  The island is fancifully said to be shaped like a turtle.  Before the arrival of the [[Anishinaabe]] peoples to the region, the Anishinaabe claims the island was the home to the "Misi'nimäk Kimiko Wini'niwuk" ("Michilimackinac men", "Mackinac Island Band of [[Menominee]]" or ''Mishinii-makinaakoo-ininiwag'' in the contemporary [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwa]] spelling).  Father [[Frederic Baraga]] simply defined in his dictionary the name of this band of Menominee as "some strange Indians"&mdash;a tribe not familiar to him.

==Miscellaneous topics==
The island is served by the [[Mackinac Island Public School]].

The short-lived [[Mackinac College]] was founded on the island in the late 1960s. The college closed after several years, and some time later the campus was turned into the Mission Point Resort.

The 1947 movie ''This Time For Keeps'' and the 1980 movie ''[[Somewhere in Time (movie)|Somewhere in Time]]'' were filmed on Mackinac Island.

The [[Michigan Governor's Residence|Michigan Governor's Summer Residence]] is located on Mackinac Island and is considered one of the finest gubernatorial homes in the country.

The [[Mackinac Conference]] took place on the island in 1943, in which the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] abandoned [[isolationism]] in favor of a cautious internationalism.
