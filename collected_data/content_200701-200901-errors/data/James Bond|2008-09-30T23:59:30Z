'''''James Bond 007''''' is a [[fictional character]] created in 1953 by writer [[Ian Fleming]], who featured him in twelve [[novel]]s and two [[short story]] collections.<ref>[http://www.lilith-ezine.com/articles/2006/understanding007.html Understanding 007], retrieved 6 June 2007.</ref> The character has also been used in the second longest running and second most successful [[media franchise|film franchise]] to date, starting in 1962 with ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''.<ref>[http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/movies/index.php3 MI6:: The Home Of James Bond 007<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117971747.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1 'Harry Potter' toots box office horn - Entertainment News, Los Angeles, Media - Variety<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> There have been 21 films in the [[EON Productions]] [[James Bond (film series)|series]] to date, with the 22nd, ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'', due for release in November 2008<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7206997.stm BBC NEWS | Entertainment | New Bond film title is confirmed<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (although the UK release date has been moved forward to 31st October <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7304920.stm BBC NEWS | Entertainment | Next Bond film gets early release<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>). In addition there have been two independent feature productions (a 1967 spoof version of ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' starring [[David Niven]] in the title role, and 1983's ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'') and one Fleming-licenced [[United States|American]] television [[Casino Royale (Climax! episode)|adaptation]] of the first novel, aired in 1954. In 1956, ''[[Moonraker (novel)|Moonraker]]'' was also adapted into a [[South Africa]]n radio play starring [[Bob Holness]] as Bond. In 1990, ''[[You Only Live Twice (novel)|You Only Live Twice]]'' was adapted into a 90 minute radio play for BBC Radio 4 with [[Michael Jayston]] playing James Bond.

After Fleming's death in 1964, subsequent James Bond novels were written by [[Kingsley Amis]] (as [[Robert Markham]]), [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]], [[John Gardner (thriller writer)|John Gardner]] and [[Raymond Benson]]. In addition [[Charlie Higson]] has begun to write a series of books detailing the "[[Young Bond|Young James Bond]]".<ref>[http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/literary/index.php3 MI6:: The Home Of James Bond 007<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Moreover, [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]] novelised two screenplays, while other writers have authored unofficial versions of the character. 

In [[July 2007]], it was announced that [[Sebastian Faulks]] has been commissioned to write a new Bond novel to commemorate Fleming's 100th Birthday.  The book - titled ''[[Devil May Care (novel)|Devil May Care]]'' - was published on 27 May 2008 with an imposing launch involving the Royal Navy's [[HMS Exeter (D89)|HMS Exeter]] and a military speedboat racing up the Thames. 

In 2008, [[BBC Radio 4]] was granted the rights for a one-shot broadcast of a radio adaptation of another 007 novel: ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Dr. No]]'', with [[Toby Stephens]] (who portrayed [[Gustav Graves|the villain]] in ''[[Die Another Day]]'') as James Bond. The [[EON Productions]] films are generally termed as "official" films originating with the purchase of the James Bond film rights by producer [[Harry Saltzman]] in the late 1950s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Winder |first=Simon |year=2006 |title=The Man Who Saved Britain |publisher=Picador |isbn=0-330-43954-5}}</ref>

Apart from movies, TV and radio, Bond has also been adapted for many other media, including comic strips and [[video games]].

==Creation and inspiration==
{{main|James Bond (character)|Inspirations for James Bond}}
[[Image:Sidneyreilly.gif‎|right|thumb|[[Sidney Reilly]], ''The Ace of Spies'', is often considered the archetypal muse for Bond.]]
Commander James Bond, [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]], [[Royal Naval Reserve|RNVR]] is an agent of the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS) (more commonly, [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]]). He was created in January 1952 by British journalist Ian Fleming while on holiday at his [[Jamaica]]n estate, Goldeneye. The hero, James Bond, was named after an [[United States|American]] [[James Bond (ornithologist)|ornithologist]], a [[Caribbean]] bird expert and author of the definitive field guide book ''[[Birds of the West Indies]].'' Fleming, a keen [[Birdwatching|birdwatcher]], had a copy of Bond's [[field guide]] at Goldeneye. Of the name, Fleming once said in a [[Reader's Digest]] interview, "I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers.' Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure &mdash; an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department."<ref>{{cite book | last = Chancellor | first = Henry | year = 2005 | title = James Bond: The Man and His World | publisher = John Murray | id = ISBN 0-7195-6815-3}}</ref>

Nevertheless, news sources speculated about real [[espionage|spies]] or other [[covert operations|covert agents]] after whom James Bond might have been modeled or named, such as [[Sidney Reilly]] or [[William Stephenson]], best-known by his wartime intelligence codename of Intrepid.  Although they are similar to Bond, Fleming confirmed none as the source figure, nor did [[Ian Fleming Publications]] nor any of Fleming's biographers, such as [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]] or Andrew Lycett. But Fleming did make the following quote:

"James Bond is a highly romanticized version of a true spy. The real thing is...William Stephenson." --Ian Fleming, The Times, October 21, 1962.

James Bond's parents are Andrew Bond, a [[Scottish people|Scotsman]], and Monique Delacroix, from Canton de [[Vaud]], [[Switzerland]]. Their nationalities were established in ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service]].'' Fleming emphasised Bond's Scottish heritage in admiration of [[Sean Connery]]'s cinematic portrayal, whereas Bond's mother is named after a Swiss fiancée of Fleming's. A planned, but unwritten, novel would have portrayed Bond's mother as a Scot. Ian Fleming was a member of a prominent Scottish [[banking]] family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://salon.com/books/feature/2006/11/25/fleming/|title=salon.com/books/feature/2006/11/25/fleming/<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref> In his fictional biography of secret agent 007, John Pearson gave Bond's birth date as 11 November ([[Armistice Day]]) 1920 (The beginning of the film "For Your Eyes Only" gives his wife's birthdate as 1943. This seemingly assumes Bond to be younger than Pearson claimed). There is a reference to Bond's age in Fleming's ''You Only Live Twice'', when Tanaka tells him he was born in the Year of the Rat (1924/25 or even 1912/13). In the novel ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service]],'' Bond's family motto is found to be "Orbis non sufficit" ("The world is not enough"). The novel also states that the family that used this motto may not necessarily be the same Bond family from which James Bond came.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~tmf20/bond.shtml|title=Biography of the Literary James Bond}}</ref>

[[Image:HoagyCarmichael.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hoagy Carmichael]]—another James Bond role model.]]

After completing the manuscript for ''Casino Royale,'' Fleming allowed his friend, later his editor, poet [[William Plomer]] to read it. Plomer liked it and submitted it to [[Jonathan Cape]], who did not like it as much. Cape finally published it in 1953 on the recommendation of Fleming's older brother [[Peter Fleming|Peter]], an established [[Travel literature|travel writer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/ian_fleming_biography.php3|title=Ian Fleming Biography Discussing Early Writings}}</ref>

Most researchers agree that James Bond is a romanticised version of Ian Fleming, himself a jet-setting [[womanizer]]. Both Fleming and Bond attended the same schools, preferred the same foods ([[scrambled eggs]], and [[coffee]]), maintained the same habits (drinking, smoking, wearing short-sleeve shirts), shared the same notions of the perfect woman in looks and style, and had similar naval career paths (both rising to the rank of naval [[Commander]]). They also shared similar height, hairstyle, and [[Eye color|eye colour]]. Some suggest that Bond's suave and sophisticated persona is based on that of a young [[Hoagy Carmichael]]. In ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]],'' the [[anti-heroine]] [[Vesper Lynd]] remarks, "[[Bond]] reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless." Likewise, in ''[[Moonraker (novel)|Moonraker]],'' [[Special Branch]] Officer [[Gala Brand]] thinks that Bond is "certainly good-looking&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way. That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow. Much the same bones. But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth, and the eyes were cold."<ref>{{cite book | last = Amis | first = Kingsley | year = 1965 | title = The James Bond Dossier | publisher = Jonathan Cape}}</ref>

Fleming did admit to being partly inspired by his service in the [[Naval Intelligence Division (UK)|Naval Intelligence Division]] of the [[Admiralty]], most notably an incident depicted in ''Casino Royale,'' when Fleming and [[Naval Intelligence Division|Naval Intelligence Director]] [[John Henry Godfrey|Admiral Godfrey]] went on a mission to [[Lisbon]] en route to the United States during [[World War II]]. At the [[Estoril Casino]], which harboured spies of warring regimes due to [[Portugal]]'s neutrality, Fleming was 'cleaned out' by a "chief [[Germany|German]] agent" in a game of [[Baccarat#Baccarat Chemin de Fer|Chemin de Fer]]. Admiral Godfrey's account differs in that Fleming played Portuguese businessmen, whom Fleming fantasised as German agents he defeated at cards. Moreover, references to "Red Indians" in Casino Royale (four times; twice in the final page) are to his own [[30 Assault Unit]].

In [[February]] [[1952]], Ian Fleming began writing his first James Bond novel. At the time, Fleming was the foreign manager for Kemsley Newspapers, owners of ''[[The Daily Express]]'' in [[London]]. Upon accepting the job, Fleming asked for two months' yearly vacation in his contract—time spent writing in [[Jamaica]]. Between [[1953]] and his death in [[1964]], Fleming published twelve novels and one short-story collection (a second collection was published posthumously). Later, continuation novels were written by [[Kingsley Amis]] (as [[Robert Markham]]), [[John Gardner (thriller writer)|John Gardner]], [[Charlie Higson]], [[Raymond Benson]], who was the first American author of James Bond, and Sebastian Faulks. The [[Young Bond]] series of novels was begun in [[2005]], by [[Charlie Higson]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.commanderbond.net/?action=Story&SID=2677 | title = Charlie Higson interview with CommanderBond.net | work = The Charlie Higson CBn Interview | accessmonthday = February 23 | accessyear = 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Benson | first = Raymond | year = 1984 | title = The James Bond Bedside Companion | publisher = Dodd, Mead | id = ISBN 1-4011-0284-0 }}</ref>

==Adaptations==
===Films===
====Overview====
{{main|James Bond film series}}
In the late 1950s, [[EON Productions]] guaranteed the [[film]] adaptation rights for every 007 novel except for ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' (those rights were recovered in 1999<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/scoop_article.asp?ai=12092&si=128|title=Bond, from the beginning?}}</ref>). In 1962, the first adaptation was made with ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', which starred [[Sean Connery]] as 007. Connery starred in 6 more films after his initial portrayal (including 1983's ''Never Say Never Again'', which was not part of the EON series). [[George Lazenby]] replaced Connery for 1 film before the latter's last EON film, after which the part was played by [[Roger Moore]] (for 7 films), [[Timothy Dalton]] (2 films), [[Pierce Brosnan]] (4 films) and [[Daniel Craig]]. As of 2007, there have been 21 films. The 21st film, ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', with [[Daniel Craig]] as James Bond, premiered on [[14 November]], [[2006]],<!---- DO NOT CHANGE THIS DATE.

The James Bond films have grossed over $4 billion (£2 Billion) (nearly $11 billion when adjusted for inflation) worldwide, making it the second highest grossing film series ever after ''[[Harry Potter film series|Harry Potter]]'' when not adjusting for inflation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_6980000/newsid_6989800/6989823.stm|title= Potter films most successful ever|publisher=[[CBBC]]|date=2007-09-11|accessdate=2007-12-15}}</ref>

===Non-EON films, radio and television programmes===
In 1954, [[CBS]] paid Ian Fleming for the rights to adapt ''Casino Royale'' into a one hour [[television]] adventure as part of their ''[[Climax!]]'' series. However, Barry Nelson played a CIA agent named Jimmy Bond, Clarence Lieter was a British agent played by Michael Pate and Peter Lorre was Le Chiffre.

In 1967, ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' was made as a Bond film starring [[David Niven]] as Sir James Bond 007 and [[Ursula Andress]] as Vesper Lynd. David Niven, had, in fact, been [[Ian Fleming]]'s preference for the part of James Bond.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hmss.com/books/fleming/|title= Ian Fleming, Author or Spy ?|accessdate=2007-08-24}} </ref> [[EON Productions]], however, chose [[Sean Connery]]. David Niven is the only James Bond actor who is mentioned by name in the text of two of Fleming's James Bond novels. In ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', Bond visits an exclusive ski resort and is told that David Niven is a frequent visitor and in ''[[You Only Live Twice (novel)|You Only Live Twice]]'' Kissy Suzuki mentions him as the only man who had been kind to her in her brief foray to Hollywood. Ursula Andress is also mentioned in the text of ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' as being present at the ski resort. 

The 1973 [[BBC]] documentary ''[[Omnibus (TV series)|Omnibus]]: The British Hero'' featured [[Christopher Cazenove]] playing a number of such title characters (e.g. [[Richard Hannay]] and [[Bulldog Drummond]]), including James Bond in dramatised scenes from ''[[Goldfinger]]'' - notably featuring the hero being threatened with the novel's circular saw, rather than the film's laser beam - and ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''.<ref>''[[Radio Times]]'', 6-12 October 1973, pages 74-79</ref>

A legal loophole allowed [[Kevin McClory]] to release a remake of ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' titled ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' in 1983. The film, featuring [[Sean Connery]] as Bond, is not considered an "official" James Bond film because it is not part of the Bond film franchise from [[EON Productions]] and [[United Artists]], although it is currently owned by United Artists parent MGM. Its original theatrical release in October 1983 actually created a situation in which two Bond movies were playing in theaters at the same time, as the "official" EON Bond film, ''[[Octopussy]]'' was still playing in theaters. Since then, MGM has bought the name "James Bond", preventing a repeat of this episode.

James Bond has long been a household name and remains a huge influence within the spy genre. The ''[[Austin Powers]]'' series by writer, producer and comedian [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]], and other parodies such as ''[[Johnny English]]'' (2003), ''[[Bons baisers de Hong Kong]]'', ''[[OK Connery]]'', the "[[Our Man Flint|Flint]]" series starring [[James Coburn]] as Derek Flint, the "[[Matt Helm]]" movies starring [[Dean Martin]], and ''Casino Royale'' (1967) are testaments to Bond's prominence in popular culture.<ref>{{cite book |last= Chapman |first= James |year= 1999 |title= Licence To Thrill: A Cultural History Of The James Bond Films |publisher= [[I.B. Tauris]] |isbn= 1-86064-387-6}}</ref>

The Bond series also received many [[James Bond parodies|homages and parodies]] in popular media. The 1960s TV imitations of James Bond such as ''[[I Spy]]'', ''[[Get Smart]]'', and ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' went on to become popular successes in their own right, the last having enjoyed contributions by Fleming towards its creation: the show's lead character, "[[Napoleon Solo]]," was named after a character in Fleming's novel ''Goldfinger''; Fleming also suggested the character name April Dancer, which was later used in the spin-off series ''[[The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/Wmkoenig/uncle007.htm|title=James Bond and Man From U.N.C.L.E ties }}</ref> A reunion [[television movie]], ''[[The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' (1983), is notable for featuring a cameo by George Lazenby as James Bond in tribute to Fleming (for legal reasons, the character was credited as "JB"). 

[[George Lucas]] has said on various occasions that Sean Connery's portrayal of Bond was one of the primary inspirations for the [[Indiana Jones]] character, a reason Connery was chosen for the role of Indiana's father in the third film of that series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/08/28/indiana_jones_was_supposed_to_be_like_ja|title=Bond Inspiration For Indiana Jones}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Fleurier |first= Nicolas |year= 2006 |title= James Bond & Indiana Jones. Action figures |publisher= Histoire & Collections |isbn= 2-35250-005-2}}</ref>

==Music==
{{Main|James Bond music}}

The "[[James Bond Theme]]" was written by [[Monty Norman]] and was first orchestrated by the [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] Orchestra for 1962s ''Dr. No'', although the actual authorship of the music has been a matter of controversy for many years. In 2001, Norman won £30,000 in libel damages from the British paper ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', which suggested that Barry was entirely responsible for the composition.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/1229406.stm |title= Monty Norman sues for libel |work= Bond theme writer wins damages |accessmonthday= March 9 |accessyear= 2006}}</ref>

Barry did go on to compose the [[Film score|scores]] for eleven Bond films in addition to his uncredited contribution to ''Dr. No'', and is credited with the creation of "[[The 007 Theme|007]]," used as an alternate Bond theme in several films, as well as the popular orchestrated theme "On Her Majesty's Secret Service." Both the "James Bond Theme" and "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" have been [[remix]]ed a number of times by popular artists, including [[Art of Noise]], [[Moby]], [[Paul Oakenfold]], and the [[Propellerheads]]. The Beatles used a portion of the "Bond theme" in the introduction of their song "Help" as released on the American version of the "Help" LP. The British/Australian [[string quartet]] also named [[Bond (band)|bond]] (purposely in lower case) recorded their own version of the theme, entitled "Bond on Bond."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bondmusic.net/home.html|title="Bond on Bond", the Redux of The Bond Theme}}</ref>

Barry's legacy was followed by [[David Arnold]], in addition to other well-known composers and [[record producer]]s such as [[George Martin]], [[Bill Conti]], [[Michael Kamen]], [[Marvin Hamlisch]] and [[Éric Serra]]. Arnold is the series' current composer of choice and is currently composing the score for the 22nd Bond film, ''Quantum of Solace''.

A Bond film staple are the theme songs heard during their [[title sequence]]s sung by well-known popular singers (which have included [[Tina Turner]], [[Wings (band)|Paul McCartney and Wings]], [[Sheryl Crow]] and [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], among many others). [[Shirley Bassey]] performed three themes in total. After ''Doctor No'', ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' is the only Bond film with a solely instrumental theme, though [[Louis Armstrong]]'s ballad "[[We Have All the Time in the World]]," which serves as Bond and his wife Tracy's [[love song]] and whose title is Bond's last line in the film, is considered the unofficial theme. Likewise, although the credit sequence to [[From Russia with Love]] features an instrumental version of the film's theme, another version, with lyrics sung by [[Matt Monro]], can be partially heard within the film itself, and is featured on the film's soundtrack album.

Perhaps one of the best-known of these compositions is the theme song to ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me ]]'', which is entitled "[[Nobody Does It Better]]". Written by [[Marvin Hamlisch]] with lyrics by [[Carole Bayer Sager]] and sung by [[Carly Simon]], "Nobody Does It Better" was the first Bond theme not to share its title with that of the movie, although the words "the spy who loved me" do appear in the lyrics. The song is featured in both credit sequences of the film, and in orchestral form throughout. "Nobody Does It Better" was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for "Best Original Song" of 1977, but lost to the theme song to [[You Light Up My Life]]. Hamlisch's score for the film was also nominated for an "[[Academy Award|Oscar]]", but lost to [[John Williams]]' score for [[Star Wars]].

The only other Bond themes to be nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for best song are "[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]]", written by [[Paul McCartney|Paul]] and [[Linda McCartney]] and performed by their group [[Wings (band)|Wings]], and "[[For Your Eyes Only (song)|For Your Eyes Only]]", written by [[Bill Conti]] and [[Michael Leeson]] and performed by [[Sheena Easton]], though a few of John Barry's scores have been nominated.

The only singer, to date, to appear within a title sequence is [[Sheena Easton]] during ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]''. The only singer of a title song to appear as a character within the film itself, to date, is [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], who appeared (uncredited) as fencing instructor Verity, as well as contributing the theme for ''[[Die Another Day]]''. The title sequence in ''Die Another Day'' is notable, however, for being the only one in which the visuals actually serve to further the plot of the film itself, as opposed to being merely a montage or collage of abstract images related to the film or to the larger James Bond mythos.

The latest theme song is [[Chris Cornell]]'s "[[You Know My Name]]", from ''Casino Royale''. He is the first male [[Singer|lead vocalist]] to perform a 007 song since [[a-ha]] in 1987 for "[[The Living Daylights]]." This is also the first Bond theme song since 1983s ''Octopussy'' to use a different title than the film. It is the only theme that was not included in the film's official soundtrack release.  Although many of the theme songs were successful hits, the only theme song to hit #1 in the U.S. was [[Duran Duran]]'s "[[A View to a Kill (song)|A View to a Kill]]" which hit the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cylist.com/List/400300146/|title='A View to a Kill' on 1985 Billboard Hot 100}}</ref>

In 1998, Barry's music from ''You Only Live Twice'' was adapted into the hit song ''[[Millennium (song)|Millennium]]'' by producer and composer [[Guy Chambers]] for British recording artist [[Robbie Williams]]. The music video features Williams parodying James Bond, and references other Bond films such as ''Thunderball'' and ''From Russia With Love''. It should also be noted that the video was filmed at Pinewood Studios, where most of the Bond films have been made.

In 2004 the [[Cavaliers Drum and Bugle Corps]] won the [[Drum Corps International]] World Championship with "007," using the music of James Bond as composed by David Arnold. The Cavaliers performed selections from ''GoldenEye'', ''Die Another Day'' ("Hovercraft Theme" and "Welcome to Cuba"), and ''Tomorrow Never Dies''.

[[Burt Bacharach]]'s score for 1967's ''Casino Royale'' included "[[The Look of Love (1967 song)|The Look Of Love]]", nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Song]], has become a standard for its era, with the biggest-selling version recorded by [[Sergio Mendes]] and [[Brasil '66]] (#4 on the Billboard pop charts in 1968). It was heard again in the [[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery|first Austin Powers film]], which was to a degree inspired by ''Casino Royale''.

==Video games==
{{main|James Bond (games)}}
[[Image:Everything or Nothing.jpg|thumb|''[[James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing|Everything or Nothing]]'' featured Pierce Brosnan as James Bond]]

In 1983, the first Bond video game, developed and published by [[Parker Brothers]], was released for the [[Atari 2600]], the [[Atari 5200]], the [[Atari 800]], the [[Commodore 64]], and the [[ColecoVision]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/3774/HTML/Games/JB_007.html|title=James Bond Games: James Bond 007|accessdate=2007-03-12}}</ref> Since then, there have been numerous video games either based on either the films or using original storylines.

Bond video games, however, did not reach their popular stride until 1997s revolutionary ''[[GoldenEye 007]]'' by [[Rare (company)|Rare]] for the [[Nintendo 64]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/contest/top10|title=Goldeneye 007 Ranking on GameFaqs Top 10 Games}}</ref> Subsequently, virtually every Bond video game has attempted to copy the accomplishments and features of ''GoldenEye 007'' to varying degrees of success; even going so far as to have a game entitled ''[[GoldenEye: Rogue Agent]]'' that had little to do with either the video game ''GoldenEye 007'' or the film of the same name. Bond himself plays only a minor role in which he is "killed" in the beginning during a '[[virtual reality]]' mission, which served as the first level of the game.

Since acquiring the licence in 1999, [[Electronic Arts]] has released eight games, five of which have original stories, including the popular ''[[James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing|Everything or Nothing]]'', which broke away from the [[first-person shooter]] trend that started with ''GoldenEye 007'' (including the games "Agent Under Fire" and "Nightfire") and instead featured a [[third-person shooter|third-person]] perspective. It also featured well known actors including [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Heidi Klum]], [[Judi Dench]], [[John Cleese]] and [[Pierce Brosnan]] as James Bond, although several previous games have used Brosnan's likeness as Bond. In 2005, Electronic Arts released a video game adaptation of ''[[From Russia with Love (video game)|From Russia with Love]]'', another game in the same vein as ''Everything or Nothing''. This was the second game based on a Connery Bond film (the first was a 1980s [[text adventure]] adaptation of ''Goldfinger'') and the first to allow the player to play as Bond with the likeness of [[Sean Connery]].  Connery himself recorded new voice-overs for the game, the first time the actor had played Bond in twenty-two years.

In 2006, [[Activision]] secured the licence to make Bond-related games, briefly sharing but effectively taking over the licence from EA. The deal became exclusive to Activision in September 2007.<ref>{{cite web | first=Ben | last=Fritz | title=Action traction: Bond, Superman games on the move | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117942524?categoryid=18&cs=1 | publisher=Variety | date=[[2006-05-03]]|accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref> Activision studio Treyarch is developing ''"Quantum of Solace: The Video Game"'' which will cover both ''Casino Royale'' and ''Quantum of Solace'' combined.  It is due to be released in November 2008 in line with the cinema release of ''Quantum of Solace''.

A [[J2ME]] game for [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-enabled [[cellular phones]], called ''[[007: Hoverchase]]'' has been developed by [[IOMO]] and published by [[Vodaphone]].

==Comic strips and comic books==
{{main|James Bond (comic strip)|James Bond comic books}}

In 1957 the ''[[Daily Express]]'', a newspaper owned by [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], approached Ian Fleming to adapt his stories into comic strips. After initial reluctance by Fleming who felt the strips would lack the quality of his writing, agreed and the first strip ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' was published in 1958. Since then many illustrated adventures of James Bond have been published, including every Ian Fleming novel as well as [[Kingsley Amis|Kingsley Amis's]] ''[[Colonel Sun]]'', and most of Fleming's short stories. Later, the comic strip produced original stories, continuing until 1983.

[[Titan Books]] is presently reprinting these comic strips in an [[ongoing series]] of [[graphic novel]]-style collections; by the end of 2005 it had completed reprinting all Fleming-based adaptations as well as ''Colonel Sun'' and had moved on to reprinting original stories.

Several [[comic book]] adaptations of the James Bond films have been published through the years, as well as numerous original stories.

Most recently, a thinly-veiled version of Bond (called only "Jimmy" to avoid copyright issues) appeared in ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier]]''. In this story, Bond is the villain; he chases the heroic duo of [[Mina Harker|Mina Murray]] and [[Allan Quatermain]] across London, aided by disguised versions of [[Bulldog Drummond]] ("Hugo Drummond") and [[Emma Peel]] ("Miss Night").

==Characters==
{{See also|List of James Bond allies|List of James Bond villains|Bond girl}}

The James Bond series of novels and films have a plethora of allies and villains. Bond's superiors and other officers of the British Secret Service are known by letters, such as [[M (James Bond)|M]] and [[Q (James Bond)|Q]]. In the novels, Bond has employed two secretaries, [[List of James Bond allies#Ponsonby, Loelia|Loelia Ponsonby]] and [[List of James Bond allies#Goodnight, Mary|Mary Goodnight]], who in the films typically have their roles and lines transferred to M's secretary, [[Miss Moneypenny]]. Occasionally Bond is assigned to work a case with his good friend, [[Felix Leiter]] of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. In the films, Leiter appeared regularly during the Connery era, only once during Moore's tenure, and in Dalton's [[Licence To Kill]]; however, he was only played by the same actor twice. Absent from the Brosnan era of films (though replaced by [[Jack Wade]]), Felix returned in Craig's first James Bond film ''Casino Royale'' in 2006, as it was a [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]].

Throughout both the novels and the films there have only been a handful of [[recurring character]]s. Some of the more memorable ones include [[List of James Bond allies#Tanner, Bill|Bill Tanner]], [[List of James Bond allies#Mathis, Rene|Rene Mathis]], [[Felix Leiter]], [[List of James Bond allies#Wade, Jack|Jack Wade]], [[Jaws (James Bond)#|Jaws]] and recently [[Charles Robinson (James Bond)|Charles Robinson]]. [[J.W. Pepper]] is also a recurring character.<ref name="Legacy">{{cite book | last = Cork | first = John | year = 2002 | title = James Bond: The Legacy | publisher = Boxtree/Mcmillan | id = ISBN 0-8109-3296-2 }}</ref>

==Vehicles and gadgets==
{{main|List of James Bond vehicles|List of James Bond gadgets|List of James Bond firearms}}

Exotic espionage equipment and vehicles are very popular elements of James Bond's literary and cinematic missions. These items often prove critically important to Bond in successfully completing his missions.

[[Image:Aston.db5.coupe.300pix.jpg|thumb|An [[Aston Martin DB5]] as seen in [[Goldfinger]].]]

Fleming's novels and early screen adaptations presented minimal equipment such as ''From Russia with Love'''s booby-trapped [[attaché case]]. In ''Dr. No'', Bond's sole gadgets were a [[Geiger counter]] and a wristwatch with a luminous (and [[radioactive]]) face. The gadgets, however, assumed a higher profile in the 1964 film ''Goldfinger''. The film's success encouraged further espionage equipment from Q Branch to be supplied to Bond. In the opinion of critics, some Bond films have included too many gadgets and vehicles,<ref>{{cite book | last = Lindner | first = Christoph | year = 2003 | title = The James Bond Phenomenon: A Critical Reader | publisher = Manchester University Press | id = ISBN 0-7190-6541-0 }}</ref> such as 1979's [[science fiction]]-oriented ''Moonraker'' and 2002's ''Die Another Day''.

James Bond's cars have included the Aston Martin DB5, V8 Vantage (80s), V12 Vanquish and DBS (00s); the Lotus Esprit; the [[BMW Z3]], [[BMW]] 750iL and the [[BMW Z8]]. Bond's most famous car is the silver grey [[Aston Martin DB5]], first seen in ''Goldfinger'' it later features in ''Thunderball'', ''GoldenEye'', ''Tomorrow Never Dies'', and ''Casino Royale''. The films have used a number of different Aston Martin DB5s for filming and publicity, one of which was sold in January 2006 at an auction in [[Arizona]] for $2,090,000 to an unnamed European collector. That specific car was originally sold for £5,000 in 1970.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4633986.stm | title = Aston Martin DB5 auction | work = James Bond car sold for over £1&nbsp;m | accessmonthday = February 8 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

In Fleming's books, Bond had a penchant for "battleship grey" [[Bentley]]s, while Gardner awarded the agent a modified [[Saab 900]] Turbo (nicknamed the [[Licence Renewed#The Silver Beast|Silver Beast]]) and later a [[Bentley Mulsanne]] Turbo.

In the James Bond film adaptations, Bond has been associated with several well-known watches, usually outfitted with high-tech features not found on production models. The [[Rolex Submariner]], one of the few recurring models, was worn by Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, and Timothy Dalton's versions of James Bond.  Roger Moore also sported a number of digital watches by [[Pulsar]] and [[Seiko]].  Pierce Brosnan's and Daniel Craig's James Bonds were both devotees of the [[Omega SA#James_Bond|Omega Seamaster]]. The selection of James Bond's watch has been a matter of both style and finance, as product placement agreements with the watch manufacturers have frequently been arranged.

Bond's weapon of choice in the beginning of ''Dr. No'' is an Italian-made [[Beretta 418]] .25 calibre, later replaced by the German-made [[Walther PPK]] (a peculiar choice, as [[Valentin Zukovsky]] remarks in [[GoldenEye]]: the PPK as found in the U.S. and Western Europe is most commonly chambered in [[.380ACP]]). The PPK was used in every subsequent film and became his [[signature weapon]] until the ending of ''Tomorrow Never Dies'', when Bond upgraded to the [[Walther P99]]. He has subsequently used the P99 pistol in ''Tomorrow Never Dies'', ''The World Is Not Enough'', ''Die Another Day'', and ''Casino Royale''.
