'''Upsilon Andromedae b''', occasionally referred to as '''Upsilon Andromedae Ab''' (to distinguish it from the [[red dwarf]] [[star]] [[Upsilon Andromedae|Upsilon Andromedae B]]), is an [[extrasolar planet]] approximately 44 [[light-year]]s away in the [[constellation]] of [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]] (the [[Virginity|Chained Maiden]]).  The planet was discovered orbiting the [[Solar twin]] star, [[Upsilon Andromedae]], approximately every five days.  Discovered in June of 1996 by [[Geoffrey Marcy]] and [[R. Paul Butler]], it was one of the first [[hot Jupiter]]s to be discovered.  Upsilon Andromedae b is the innermost known planet in its [[planetary system]].

== Discovery ==

Like the majority of known extrasolar planets, Upsilon Andromedae b was detected by the variations in its star's [[radial velocity]] caused by the planet's [[gravity]]. The variations were detected by making sensitive measurements of the [[Doppler shift]] of Upsilon Andromedae's [[spectrum]]. The planet was announced in Jan 1997, together with [[55 Cancri b]] and the planet orbiting [[Tau Boötis]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/310444|author=Butler, R. et al.|title=Three New 51 Pegasi-Type Planets|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=474|year=1997|pages=L115 – L118|doi=10.1086/310444}}</ref>

[[Image:PIA01936.jpg|thumb|left|the orbit of Upsilon Andromedae b.]]

Like [[51 Pegasi b]], the first extrasolar planet discovered around a normal star, Upsilon Andromedae b orbits very close to its star, closer than [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] does to our Sun. The planet takes 4.617 [[day]]s to complete an orbit, with a [[semimajor axis]] of 0.0595 [[Astronomical unit|AU]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/504701|author=Butler, R. et al.|title=Catalog of Nearby Exoplanets|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=646|pages=505 &ndash; 522|year=2006|doi=10.1086/504701}} ([http://exoplanets.org/planets.shtml web version])</ref>

A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect Upsilon Andromedae b is that only a lower limit on the [[mass]] can be found. In the case of Upsilon Andromedae b, this lower limit is 68.7% of the mass of [[Jupiter]], though depending on the [[inclination]] of the orbit, the [[true mass]] may be much greater. However, astronomers found recently that inclination of the [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] is >30° and the [[true mass]] is somewhere between 0.687 to 1.37 [[Jupiter mass|M<sub>J</sub>]].<ref>{{cite journal | title=The υ Andromedae Planetary System - Hubble Space Telescope Astrometry and High-precision Radial Velocities |author=Benedict, George F.; McArthur, B.

== Physical characteristics ==

Given the planet's high mass, it is likely that Upsilon Andromedae b is a [[gas giant]] with no [[solid]] surface. Since the planet has only been detected indirectly, properties such as its [[radius]] and composition are unknown.

The [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] measured the planet [[temperature]], and found that the difference between the two sides of Upsilon Andromedae b of about 1,400 degrees Celsius, ranging from minus 20 to 230 degrees to about 1,400 to 1,650 degrees Celsius.<ref>{{cite journal | first = J | last = Harrington | coauthors = Hansen BM, Luszcz SH, Seager S, Deming D, Menou K, Cho JY, Richardson LJ | year = 2006 | month = Oct 27 | title = The phase-dependent infrared brightness of the extrasolar planet upsilon Andromedae b | journal = Science | volume = 314 | issue = 5799 | pages = 623–6 | pmid = 17038587 | accessdate = 2006-12-01 | doi = 10.1126/science.1133904}}</ref>  The temperature difference has led to speculation that Upsilon Andromedae b is [[Tidal locking|tidal locked]] with the same side always facing Upsilon Andromedae A.

Sudarsky had, on the assumption that the planet is similar to Jupiter in composition and that its environment is close to [[chemical equilibrium]], predicted Upsilon Andromedae b to have reflective [[cloud]]s of [[silicate minerals|silicates]] and [[iron]] in its upper [[atmosphere]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...588.1121S|author=Sudarsky, D. et al.|title=Theoretical Spectra and Atmospheres of Extrasolar Giant Planets|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=588|issue=2|pages=1121 &ndash; 1148|year=2003|doi=10.1086/374331}}</ref> The cloud deck instead ''absorbs'' the sun's radiation; between that and the hot, high pressure gas surrounding the mantle, exists a [[stratosphere]] of cooler gas.<ref>{{Cite arXiv| author=Ivan Hubeny, Adam Burrows |title=Spectrum and atmosphere models of irradiated transiting extrasolar giant planets |eprint=0807.3588v1| class=astro-ph|year=2008}}</ref> The outer shell of dark, opaque, hot cloud is assumed to consist of vanadium and titanium oxides ("pM planets"), but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out as yet.

The planet is unlikely to have large [[natural satellite|moons]], since [[tide|tidal forces]] would either eject them from orbit or destroy them on short timescales compared to the age of the system.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...575.1087B|author=Barnes, J., O'Brien, D.|title=Stability of Satellites around Close-in Extrasolar Giant Planets|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=575|issue=2|pages=1087 &ndash; 1093|year=2002|doi=10.1086/341477}}</ref>

The planet (with [[51 Pegasi b]]) is deemed a candidate for direct imaging by Planetpol.<ref name=lucas>{{cite arXiv | title=Planetpol polarimetry of the exoplanet systems 55 Cnc and tau Boo | author=P.W.Lucas ''et al.'' | eprint=0807.2568v1 | year=2007 | class=astro-ph }}</ref>

== Effect on its sun==

Upsilon Andromedae b appears to be responsible for increased [[chromosphere|chromospheric]] activity on its parent star. Observations suggest that there is a "hot spot" on the star around 169° away from the sub-planetary point. This may be the result of interactions between the [[magnetic field]]s of the planet and the star. The mechanism may be similar to that responsible for the activity of [[RS Canum Venaticorum variable]] stars, or the interaction between Jupiter and its moon [[Io (moon)|Io]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.citebase.org/cgi-bin/citations?id=oai:arXiv.org:astro-ph/0411655|title=Hot Jupiters and Hot Spots: The Short- and Long-term Chromospheric Activity on Stars with Giant Planets|author=Shkolnik, E. et al.|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=622|year=2005|pages=1075 &ndash; 1090|doi=10.1086/428037}}</ref>
