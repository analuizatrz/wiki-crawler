'''Ir Ovot''' ({{lang-he|עיר אובות}}) is a cooperative agricultural [[Haredi]] [[moshav]] in [[Israel]], located in the northeastern [[Negev]], near the [[Jordan]]ian border, south of the [[Dead Sea]]. It is named for the biblical site of Oboth ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 21:10; [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 33:44), one of the places where the [[Israelite]] camped after [[the Exodus]] from [[Egypt]].

Ir Ovot, also called just Ovot, was founded in 1966 by a group of [[Messianic Judaism|Messianic Jews]]. Their religious beliefs led to antagonism with the Israeli authorities charged with settlement, and it took them several years before the community won official recognition. Their supporters included the [[Israel Defense Forces]], which were interested in the establishment of a settlement in this strategic frontier area.
