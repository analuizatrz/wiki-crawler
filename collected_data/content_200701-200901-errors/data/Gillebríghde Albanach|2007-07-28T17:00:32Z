'''Gillebríghde Albanach''' (fl. [[1200]]-[[1230]]) was a medieval Scottish [[poet]] and [[crusade]]r.  He took part, along with his fellow-Gael [[Muireadhach Albanach]], in the [[Fifth Crusade]], reaching [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] in [[1218]] or [[1219]], and following the main Crusader army via southern [[Cyprus]] to [[Damietta]];<ref>Alan MacQuarrie, ''Scotland and the Crusades'', (Edinburgh, 1997), p. 38.</ref> He may have been on crusade until [[1224]] or after.<ref>Thomas Owen Clancy (ed.), ''The Triumph Tree: Scotland's Earliest Poetry, 550&ndash;1350'', (Edinburgh, 1998), p. 247.</ref> 

When not crusading, Gillebrìghde spent much, if not most of this life working as a poet in [[Ireland]]. His [[panegyric]] poems are all dedicated to [[Irish people|Irish]] patrons. We know he was [[Scottish people|Scottish]], however, because of references to [[Scotland]] describing it as "duthchas damh", my dúthchas ("native place", "heritage", "birthright", etc) and "dom thír", my country.<ref>Wilson MacLeod, ''Divided Gaels: Gaelic Cultural Identities in Scotland and Ireland, c. 1200-1650'', (Oxford, 2004), p. 88</ref> About seven of his poems survive, five panegyric poems,<ref>Actually, Dr. Wilson MacLeod, ''op. cit.'', p. 87, says "Approxiamtely eight poem survive ... these include six panegyrics", but his lists only five of these.</ref> and two crusading poems.<ref>The details of the availability of all these poems (both panegyric and crusader) in print can be found in MacLeod, ''op. cit.'', p. 87, n. 109.</ref>
