A '''leotard''' is a [[skin-tight]] one-piece garment that covers the torso and body but leaves the legs free. It was made famous by the French acrobatic performer [[Jules Léotard]] ([[1839]]–[[1870]]), about whom the song "[[The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze]]" was written.

Leotards are worn by [[acrobatics|acrobats]], [[gymnast]]s, [[dancer]]s, [[Actor|thespians]], and [[circus (performing art)|circus]] performers both as practice garments and performance [[costume]]s. They are often worn together with [[tights]]. There are sleeveless, short-sleeved and long-sleeved leotards. A variation is the [[unitard]], which also covers the legs.

Leotards are entered through the neck. (Contrast with [[bodysuit]]s, which generally have [[snap fastener|snaps]] at the crotch, allowing the garment to be pulled on over the head.) Scoop-necked leotards have wide neck openings and are held in place by the elasticity of the garment. Others are [[crew neck]]ed or [[polo neck]]ed and close at the back of the neck with a [[zipper]] or snaps.

Many leotards are cut high enough above the legs that they expose underwear.  For this reason, underwear is often omitted, or special underwear, cut high on the waist, is worn.  Many dance studios forbid underwear.  Gymnastics judges can deduct points for visible underwear.

==History==

The first known use of the name ''leotard'' came only in 1886, many years after Léotard's death. Léotard himself called the garment a ''maillot'', which in French has now come to mean a [[swimsuit]].  In the early [[20th century]], leotards were mainly confined to [[circus]] and [[acrobatic]] shows, worn by the specialists who performed these acts.

The 1920s and 1930s saw leotards influencing the style of [[bathing suit]]s, with women's bathing suits today similar in appearance to leotards. Leotards were also worn by professional dancers such as the [[showgirl]]s of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Stage use of the leotard typically coordinated the garment with [[stockings]] or tights.

The 1950s saw leotards first used in public [[physical fitness]], with the first "exercise leotards" typically uni-colored worn with thick tights. Between 1950 and 1970, leotards remained as such in appearance until a style change in the 70s resulted in more colorful leotards appearing on the scene, most often in ballet and exercise.  Traditional leotard outfits continued to be worn by stage performers and circus actors.

Leotards became common in the 1980s both as exercise and street wear during the [[aerobics]] [[1980s in fashion#Dancewear|fashion craze]] of the time.  The leotards of the time were a variety of [[nylon]] and [[spandex]], mixed in with the more traditional cotton uni-colored leotards and tights, and frequently with a thong back.  The major leotard company [[Danskin]] flourished during this period.

==Modern usage==

Leotards became markedly less popular as exercise garments in the 1990s, being replaced by more convenient garments such as [[crop top]]s. Today the use of leotards and tights in fitness and exercise has all but vanished but the garment can still be found in traditional ballet, on the stages of musical productions, and in gymnastics.

Leotards, in combination with tights, are still often worn by young children in such activities as dance, exercise, and ballet. They are commonly worn in the sport of gymnastics, usually a sleeveless leotard in practice and a long sleeved one in competitions. Leotards can also be worn as [[lingerie]] and are eroticised by some people, often as part of a wider [[spandex fetishism]].
