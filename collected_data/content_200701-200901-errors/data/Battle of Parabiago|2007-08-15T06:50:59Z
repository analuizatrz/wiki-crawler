}}The '''Battle of Parabiago''' was fought in the February 1339 near [[Parabiago]], in [[Lombardy]], northern [[Italy]], between the St. George's (San Giorgio) Mercenaries of [[Lodrisio Visconti]] and the [[Milan|Milanese]] army. A renowned [[condottiero]], Visconti was an exiled member of the [[Visconti]] family then in power in Milan with a kind of triumvirate formed by [[Azzone Visconti|Azzone]] and his uncles, [[Luchino Visconti (ruler of Milan)|Luchino]] and archbishop [[Giovanni Visconti]], Lodrisio's brothers. Aiming to return victoriously to his city, he hired some 2,500 knights, mainly from Germany, and 1,000 Swiss infantry which had fought in the unsuccessful war of [[Mastino II della Scala]] for the hegemony in northern Italy. These units were led by [[Werner von Urslingen]] and [[Konrad von Landau]]. 

==Background==

Lodrisio Visconti set out for Lombardy in the late January 1339, defeating the Milanese in [[Rivolta d'Adda]], and later conquering  [[Cernusco sul Naviglio]], [[Sesto di Monza]] and [[Legnano]], where he was joined by the [[Scaliger]] troops. Luchino set off to met the Compagnia with his citizen militias and 700 knights from Savoy under the Bolognese [[Ettore da Panigo]]. Azzone, suffering from [[gout]], remained in Milan.

==The battle==

On [[20 February]], [[1339]], with high snow on the ground, Lodrisio's army attacked one of the two corps in which the Milanese army had divided, and which was camping near what is now the [[Canale Villoresi]], near Parabiago. The Milanese were routed and retired to Milan with Lodrisio's troops it pursuit. Here the two main corps met and the Milanese were again initially defeated with Luchino captured. However, the Milanese militia did not retreat completely and offered a confused though effective resistance. In the meantime da Panigo's knights joined with some fugitives at [[Rho]] and moved to Parabiago where they defeated the 400 men-at-arms left by Lodrisio and freed Luchino. 

In the meantime, news of the initial defeat reached Azzone, who ordered his men to move in and prepared to besiege Lodrisio's army. When the German mecercenaries where attacked by da Panigo's men they were completely routed, and Lodrisio captured in turn.

Total casualties amounted to some 6,500-7,000.

Lodrisio Visconti was prisoner in an iron cage in [[San Colombano al Lambro]] until 1349, when Azzone and Luchino died and  Giovanni Visconti freed him.

==Legend==
According to a legend, [[Ambrosius|St. Ambrosius]] himself had appeared in the battle from a white cloud, riding a horse and leading the Milanese in the decisive moments. To celebrate the event, the Giovanni Visconti had a church and an abbey built, called ''Sant'Ambrogio della Vittoria'' ("St. Ambrose of the Victory"). Until 1581, every February 21 a procession was held from Milan to Parabiago to remember the victory.
