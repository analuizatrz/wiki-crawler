The '''Appalachian School of Law''' is a fully-accredited private [[law school]] in [[Grundy, Virginia]], a small town near the convergence of [[Virginia]], [[Kentucky]], and [[West Virginia]]. The school offers a three-year [[Juris Doctor]] degree, and enrolls approximately 370 full-time students from numerous states and several foreign countries. The school also has 482 alumni and 50 staff. The law school was founded in 1994 with a deep commitment to community service and leadership, and it admitted its first class of students in August 1997.

==Academic Program==
Students at Appalachian complete the traditional law school curriculum as required by the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA); however, the school distinguishes itself from almost all of the other 192 ABA accredited law schools in the country, as its students are required to volunteer 25 hours each semester on community service projects, ranging from dispute resolution training to humane society management. Only 11 other law schools have similar mandatory programs.

Additionally, all first-year students are required to complete a 200-hour unpaid externship over the summer before their second-year. This requirement is usually met by students working as judicial clerks, interns in prosecutor and defense offices, governmental agencies, and private practices. The school provides assistance in locating and obtaining these positions.

Appalachian is also distinguished by its requirement that all second-year students complete a mandatory [[Alternative Dispute Resolution]] (ADR) class. The school has also held ADR training in local schools; this program drew national attention, particularly from former U.S. [[Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]], who has publicly congratulated the school on this effort.

==Accreditation==
Appalachian School of Law was granted full accreditation by the [[American Bar Association]] on [[June 12]], [[2006]]. The school had been provisionally accredited by the ABA since February 2001. Prior to February 2001, graduates of the school were allowed to sit for the bar examination in Virginia and Kentucky.

==Campus==
The campus of ASL currently consists of two buildings, the main academic building and the law library. The main academic building was created from the town's former high school and gymnasium complex; these buildings were joined and extensively remodeled and expanded as part of an award-winning architectural project. The two-story law library is adjacent to the main building; this building has also been extensively remodeled and features individual and group study areas, a computer lab, and both wireless and wired internet access.

==Construction==
A third campus building, Booth Hall, is now under construction. Booth Hall will be situated behind and to the rear of the main academic building and law library. The building is estimated to be completed in 2008.

==January 2002 Campus Shooting==

At trial, Odighizuwa was found mentally competent, plead guilty to the murders to avoid the [[death penalty]], and was sentenced to multiple life terms in prison.
