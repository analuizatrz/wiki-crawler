The story is an amalgamation of the first two games in the series, focusing on the first [[Tekken|King of Iron Fist Tournament]] while giving a prominent role to [[Jun Kazama]], who was introduced in ''[[Tekken 2]]''. The film was released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] in [[North America]] by [[ADV Films]] and has occasionally been aired on [[cable television]] in the U.S.

==Plot outline==

The film begins with a flashback featuring [[Kazuya Mishima]], a child studying martial arts under his father. He meets a young girl named [[Jun Kazama]], who is crying after seeing a [[bobcat]] kill a defenseless [[rabbit]]. When Kazuya offers to go fight the bobcat, Kazuya's father, [[Heihachi Mishima]], appears and drags Kazuya away. To make his son prove his strength, Heihachi throws Kazuya into a deep ravine, but not before ripping a locket containing a picture of Kazuya's mother from his son's neck and tossing it aside. Jun, who tried and failed to locate Kazuya, finds the locket and keeps it with her into adulthood.

On the day of the tournament, Kazuya and Jun fight their way through the other competitors on the island. Kazuya intends to fight his way to the center and kill his father, while Jun races to stop him. After catching up to him, Jun begins to make another appeal when they're attacked by monsters released by Lee, but they fight them off. Kazuya then continues on his way and quickly beats Lee in direct combat before squaring off against Heihachi.

The fighting is brutal, but Kazuya, who formed a pact with a devil to survive his fall into the ravine as a child, uses his demonic power to defeat his father. Before he can finish him off, however, Jun steps in one last time, and convinces Kazuya that he's going about things the wrong way. Kazuya is able to calm his spirit, and he takes mercy on his father. In the meantime, Lee, convinced that the Mishima Zaibatsu should be destroyed if he isn't allowed to inherit it, activates a self-destruct mechanism on the island. Kazuya, Jun and most of the other competitors are able to escape by ship, while Heihachi himself flees the island by air.

In a brief epilogue, Jun is by herself  sewing something among some trees with some animals when her young son, [[Jin Kazama]], who bears a strong resemblance to Kazuya, runs up to her,telling that he wants to read the story she read to him yesterday. Then Jun sensed that the winds just changed, then Jin asked what's wrong then Jun replied that it's just nothing and every thing's gonna be just fine and they walk off together.

The other major subplot, which runs concurrently with the rest of the film, features [[Lei Wulong]] working as Jun's partner, who investigates the weapons lab located below the surface of the island with the help of the combat android [[Jack (Tekken) #Jack-2|Jack-2]], who wants to cure a little girl of her illness. A few other fighters from the games, most notably [[Bruce Irvin]], [[Baek Doo San]], [[Michelle Chang]], [[Anna Williams]], [[Nina Williams]], [[Jack (Tekken) #Prototype Jack|Prototype Jack]], [[Roger (Tekken)|Roger]], and [[Ganryu (Tekken)|Ganryu]] play small parts in the story. Most of the other game characters like [[King (Tekken)|King]], [[Armor King]], [[Yoshimitsu (Namco)|Yoshimitsu]], [[Marshall Law (Tekken)|Marshall Law]], and [[Paul Phoenix (Tekken)|Paul Phoenix]] appear in background cameos with no direct influence on the story.

==Notable differences from game to film==
The ''Tekken'' motion picture takes several liberties with its source material. Along with combining events from the first two games in the series, it also rewrites important events and appearance of some of the characters.
*Jun and Kazuya met for the very first time as children. There is no evidence of this in the games.
*Anna Williams is given a rather gruesome death, but she remains alive and well in the [[Tekken 5|fifth game in the series]].
*Jack-2 is stated as the prototype while [[Jack (Tekken)#Prototype Jack|Prototype Jack]] are shown as the final version.
*There are 3 prototype Jacks.
*There are packs of [[Alex (Tekken)|Alex]]s instead of one. These don't wear the blue boxing gloves.
*Jun is wearing short white socks rather than her pastel blue knee socks, then a khaki outfit rather than her pastel blue outfit, then she is not wearing pastel blue gloves and there is no ribbon on her headband if she is wearing her fighting uniform.
*Notice Jun's attire when she first met Lei, she is wearing kung-fu shoes rather than normal shoes with short white socks.
*Heihachi is wearing his aikido uniform rather than his black karate uniform.
*The final fighting arena is not in a very dark place.
*Some of the characters hair colors are different (Example, Jun's hair is brown rather than black.)
*At the conclusion of the tournament, Kazuya was not killed.
*Devil does not appear but he made a short cameo as a light of evil and a few close-ups of his face and Jun can sense it around Kazuya.
*If this story happens in Tekken 2 about Kazuya seeking revenge against his father, he already avenged his father in Tekken 1 and Kazuya is supposed to be the current head of the Mishima Zaibatsu.
*Roger is wearing pink boxing gloves instead of red.
*Dr. Abel does not appear in the film, despite being an important character in Jack-2's storyline.
*Jack-2 gets destroyed by a closing door instead of Dr. Abel killing him with a laser via satellite.
*Bruce is Lee's bodyguard instead of being Kazuya's bodyguard.
*Marshall Law's pants are blue instead of black with a red tie.
*Lee's fighting uniform does not appear.
*Nobody won the tournament.
*Ganryu doesn't appear to show feelings for Michelle.
*Michelle is not wearing white socks.
*Bruce feels a lot of pain when he punches Jack-2.
*Jun's fringes (bangs) are big rather than small. 
*In Tekken 1, Michelle's father was killed by Heihachi while in Tekken 2, Kazuya kidnapped her mother with the help of Ganryu. 

Aside from its quality as an adaptation, ''Tekken'' is generally seen as a [[cult film]] or guilty pleasure to its relatively small group of supporters. Some fans also use the film to help explain how Kazuya and Jun conceived their son Jin, who would go on to become the lead protagonist of the video games in ''[[Tekken 3]]'', since the video games have remained rather ambiguous on those details. Because of the number of liberties that the film takes with the storyline, the film cannot be considered completely [[Canon (fiction)|canon]], but the possibility that Jun and Kazuya's storyline as depicted in the film may share parallels with the video games remains open.

==Reaction==
''Tekken: The Motion Picture'' has been variously hailed and panned by fans and critics alike. The root of the movie's popularity stems from the action and the fighting, which fans consider to be outstandingly realistic. But the designs and English voices for some of the characters have led others to dislike the film, especially for Kazuya's incredibly deep voice and striking resemblance to ''[[Dragon Ball Z|Dragon Ball Z's]]'' [[Vegeta]].

== Tekken (2009 film) ==
Little has been revealed about the new Tekken movie. What is known, is that it is set later on than in the Anime film. Crystal Sky has announced that the movie is currently in development. Tekken is being written by Michael Werb, Michael Colleary, and Hans Rodinoff. It has been said that [[Charles Stone III]] will be one of the directors.

This was the summary Crystal Sky posted on their website:

"In order to put to rest the ghosts of his past, Jin Kazama enters the Tekken tournament, a fierce and dangerous competition featuring the world’s best martial artists. Following close behind him is Zheng, a rebel monk looking to save Jin from his own inner demons. While on the surface Tekken appears to be the corporation of the future, Jin and Zheng expose a dark underbelly that could threaten the very threads of humanity."

==Trivia==
*Some characters appeared in the opening sequence but not in the actual movie. They are: [[Wang Jinrei]], [[Kunimitsu]], [[Hwoarang]], [[Ling Xiaoyu]], [[Eddy Gordo]] and [[Forrest Law|Forest Law]].
*[[Kuma (Tekken)|Kuma]] made a short cameo on a tree.
*[[Jin Kazama]] appears as a child in the film's ending. His appearance is similar to Kazuya as a child. Jin is shown as an adult in the film's opening.
*[[Gon]] is in the background of the laboratory.
*The invitation card given to Jun is spelled "wellcome" instead of "welcome".
*Some parts of the film showed some what the games did not show.(e.g: Jun, Jin & Kazuya's childhood)
*[[Kazuya Mishima|Kazuya]] almost bears a strong resemblance to [[Vegeta]].
