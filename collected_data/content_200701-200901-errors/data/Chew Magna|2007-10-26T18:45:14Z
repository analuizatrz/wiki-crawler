== History ==
Chew Magna is the largest village in the district, and can trace its importance back to [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] times. It was a thriving woollen centre in the [[Middle Ages]]. The manor of Chew was held by the [[Bishops of Bath and Wells]], from 1062 to 1548, and for that reason the village was called Chew Episcopi or Bishop's Chew. The Bishops built a palace near the church of St. Andrews, which was visited by [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] in 1250.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dunning |first=Robert |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=A History of Somerset |year=1983 |publisher=Phillimore & Co |location=Chichester |id=ISBN 0-85033-461-6 }}</ref>
Chew Court is a surviving part of the palace. More recently, since about 1600, the name has been Chew Magna because this has been the most important of the several villages along the banks of the [[River Chew]]. According to Robinson it was an episcopal property held by [[Gisa, Bishop of Wells|Giso]], the last Saxon bishop and the name Magna comes from the Latin meaning 'the greater'.<ref>{{cite book |last=Robinson |first=Stephen |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Somerset Place Names |year=1992 |publisher=The Dovecote Press Ltd |location=Wimbourne |isbn=1874336032}}</ref>

Around 1700 the Lord of the Manor was Sir William Jones the [[Attorney General]] of England<ref>{{cite book | author=Cruickshanks | year = 1986 | title = The House of Commons 1690 1715 5 Volume Set p527 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | id =ISBN 0-521-77221-4 }}</ref> and in the 1820s it was the seat of [[George Lyttelton, 4th Baron Lyttelton|Lord Lyttelton]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Great Britain Parliament | year = 1849 | title = Hansards Parliamentary Debates p779 }}</ref> 
Until about 1880 the village had [[toll road]]s and a toll house to collect the fees.<ref name="durham2">{{cite book | author = Durham, I. & M.| year = 1991 | title = Chew Magna and the Chew Valley in old photographs | publisher = Redcliffe Press | id =ISBN 1-872971-61-X }}</ref> During the 19th and 20th centuries the importance of the wool trade in the village declined and it became largely a [[Bedroom community|dormitory area]] for the cities of [[Bristol]] and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], although it has continued to be the commercial centre of the valley. The building of Chew Valley Lake in the 1950s has brought further opportunities for [[leisure]] and [[tourism]].<ref name="durham2"/>
