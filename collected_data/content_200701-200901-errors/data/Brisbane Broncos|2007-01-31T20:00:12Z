The '''Brisbane Broncos''' are a professional [[rugby league]] football team based in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. The Broncos play in the [[National Rugby League]] and are one of the most successful clubs of the modern era, having won 6 premierships in the 19 seasons they have played.

The club was founded in 1988, and was the first club from outside New South Wales (along with [[Gold Coast Chargers|Gold Coast]] and the fact that [[Canberra]] is techincally not part of NSW) to participate in the [[National Rugby League|New South Wales Rugby League]] competition. They presently have a strong rivalry against fellow Queensland club [[North Queensland Cowboys|North Queensland]]. The Broncos are the only publicly listed sporting club on the [[Australian Stock Exchange]], trading as Brisbane Broncos Limited ({{asx|BBL}}). Brisbane Broncos Ltd. is currently (as of 30 June, 2006) 68.87% owned by Rupert Murdoch's [[News Limited]].

==History==
''For more details on this topic, see [[Brisbane Broncos History|Brisbane Broncos history]].''

In the mid-1980s, the [[New South Wales Rugby League]] decided to expand the Sydney competition outside of its traditional areas. This began in 1982 with the introduction of the [[Canberra Raiders]] and the [[Illawarra Steelers]], and continued with the entrance of the Broncos, [[Newcastle Knights]] and [[Gold Coast - Tweed Giants]] in 1988. After tough competition between the various syndicates for the Brisbane license, the [[Queensland Rugby League]] chose the bid that belonged to former Brisbane Rugby League players Barry Maranta and Paul "Porky" Morgan.

The Broncos made their first grade debut in 1988 against reigning NSWRL premiers Manly-Warringah, defeating them 44-10. Although they made a promising start to their maiden season, they failed to make the finals, something that would also happen in 1989, although in their second year they won the National Panasonic Cup, the midweek knockout competition.

They first tasted premiership success in 1992, and again in 1993, both times against the [[St. George Dragons]]. In 1995, the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] war broke out, with many percieving the Brisbane Broncos as the orchestrators, however they won the inaugural (and only) Super League premiership in 1997, before winning the first [[National Rugby League]] trophy in 1998. 

1999 saw a disappointing year, which included club legend [[Allan Langer]] retiring mid-season before making a comeback with the [[Warrington Wolves]] in the [[Super League (Europe)|English Super League]]. The Broncos' fifth premiership came in 2000, when the club defeated the [[Sydney Roosters]] in the last day-time NRL Grand Final, and it also saw the retirement of [[Kevin Walters]] and stalwart [[Michael Hancock]]. 

2002 saw the return of Allan Langer for a one year stint, before retiring for the final time. It was also the beginning of Brisbane's recurring "post origin slump", which was to haunt the club for the next four years. As many of the [[Queensland Maroons]] who compete in the mid-week [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] matches are Broncos' players, this extra workload often results in a loss of form for the club around and after the time of the Origin series.  In 2003, they were in the upper echelons of the ladder, before losing their last eight games and falling to eighth place, nearly missing the finals for the first time since 1992. 2004 was more successful, in that the club finsished third, however they quickly bowed out of the finals series after losing to the [[Melbourne Storm]] and [[North Queensland Cowboys]]. In 2005 the Broncos lead for much of the season before the form slump hit again causing them  to quickly drop out of the finals.

But in 2006, it changed. The Broncos only lead the competition for two weeks in a row instead of sixteen weeks in a row, and again they were quick to enter the post-Origin slump. However in mid-August, after mounting speculation regarding coach [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league coach)|Wayne Bennett]]'s future at the club, the Broncos appeared to turn the corner in their 18-12 loss to the Melbourne Storm. The following week they comprehensively beat the Canterbury Bulldogs 30-0, before defeating the Parramatta Eels 23-0 and the New Zealand Warriors 36-12. The first week of the finals saw them lose to the St George Illawarra Dragons 20-4, however they defeated Newcastle Knights 50-6 and the Canterbury Bulldogs 37-20 to qualify for their sixth Grand Final, which they played against the Melbourne Storm, and won 15-8.

Traditionally the Broncos have a strong rivalry with fellow Queensland club [[North Queensland Cowboys|North Queensland]], as well as the previous [[Gold Coast Chargers|rugby league clubs based on the Gold Coast]]. It is expected, but as yet unknown, wether the rivalry will be continued with the [[Gold Coast Titans]]. Apart from the Round 1 game against North Queensland, the only other traditional game the club plays in is on [[Good Friday]] against the [[Sydney Roosters]].

==Crest==
[[Image:brisbane 1988.jpg|thumb|The original Broncos logo (1988-1999).]]

Initially, the moniker for the Brisbane team was to be a kangaroo, as it, along with a stylised Q, had featured as the logo for the [[Queensland Rugby League]] for many years. However as the Australian test rugby league team was also called the Kangaroos, this was deemed inappropriate. The cooktown orchard, long used by Brisbane sides in the [[Bulimba Cup (rugby league competition)|Bulimba Cup]] was also ruled out, as were other Australian animals like brumby, possum, galah and kookaburra (after Brisbane's Kookaburra Queen paddleships).<ref>Gallway, Jack. The Brisbane Broncos: The Team To Beat. p31. </ref>  Wanting to continue the alliterary trend started by the [[Brisbane Bullets]] and [[Brisbane Bears]], the club's directors eventually went with the nickname Broncos.

The original club logo, featured right, was adopted in 1988 and used until 1999. In 2000, the club adopted the current logo, which although was branded a "chess piece" initially by those unhappy with the change, the introduction of the new logo coincided with the club's fifth premiership.

==Colours==
Traditionally the colours of the Brisbane Broncos are maroon, white and gold, and are deeply linked to the history of rugby league in Queensland. Initially the founders of the Brisbane Broncos favoured blue and gold - the official colours of [[Brisbane City Council|Brisbane]], however Sydney advertiser [[John Singleton]] advised the board that "Queenslanders had been booing players wearing blue for more than three-quarters of a century" <ref> Gallway, Jack. The Brisbane Broncos: The Team To Beat. p31. </ref>. As a result maroon and white, the traditional colours of Brisbane Bulimba Cup sides, were adopted as the colours of the Broncos, along with gold, to symbolise the Queensland sunshine <ref> Gallway, Jack. The Brisbane Broncos: The Team To Beat. p31. </ref> In 2001 blue was added to the jersey as a minor colour to show the aforementioned historical link with the colours of Brisbane. Traditionally, maroon has been the dominant colour of the jersey, although in 1997-98 the jersey was predominately white.

The 1995 Sevens tournament saw the introduction of a new set of Broncos colours - mauve, aqua and white. Then Marketing Manager Shane Edwards stated that it "will become our [Broncos] Sevens strip ... but we will never change the Broncos' colours" <ref> Bronco! Magazine Issue 1, 1995 </ref>. In 2001, following the release of a predominantly navy-blue and maroon away jersey which clashed with the home jerseys of the [[Penrith Panthers]], [[Melbourne Storm]] and [[New Zealand Warriors]], the club was ordered by the [[National Rugby League]] to have a third, "clash" jersey. An aqua strip, of the same design as the 1999-2001 jerseys, was worn, and much derided by the local media. However after two years of public pressure the club dropped the jersey in favour of the design worn against Newcastle in 2003 for the first match back at the refurbished [[Suncorp Stadium]].

==Stadium==
''For more details on this topic, see [[Brisbane Broncos Stadiums]].''
[[Image:Last broncos game at anz.jpg|thumb|250px|The Brisbane Broncos, at the then-ANZ Stadium (1993-2003).]]
The Brisbane Broncos inaugural home ground was Lang Park (now Suncorp Stadium), however they moved to [[ANZ Stadium]] in 1993 following ongoing conflict with the [[Queensland Rugby League]] and the Lang Park Trust. However following a severe drop in average crowds post-Super League, and the Queensland Government's $280,000,000 redevelopment of the spiritual home of rugby league in Queensland, the Broncos returned home in mid-2003. Following the Broncos' winning of the 2006 Premiership, coupled with home matches scheduled against the high-attendance rivals North Queensland, the Gold Coast and the Melbourne Storm among others for 2007, it is expected that the average attendance per game can increase again, for the sixth consecutive year. As of 2006, they are the highest attended team in the NRL at 31,208, drawing close on 10,000 extra than their nearest rival, Newcastle, who have 21,848. <ref>http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/brisbane.html</ref>

[[Image:Suncorpstadium071006.JPG|thumb|250px|View of the current Brisbane Broncos home ground, Suncorp Stadium.]]
The record crowd for a Broncos game at [[Suncorp Stadium]] is 50,387, for the Preliminary Final in 2006 against the [[St George Illawarra Dragons]], while the record crowd at [[ANZ Stadium]] is 58,912, for the 1997 Super League Grand Final, against [[Cronulla Sharks|Cronulla]]
