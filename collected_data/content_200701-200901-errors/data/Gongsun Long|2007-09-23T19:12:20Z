'''Gongsun Long''' ({{zh-tspw|t=公孫龍|s=公孙龙|p=Gōngsūn Lóng|w='''Kung-sun Lung'''}}, ca. [[325 BC|325]]–[[250 BC]]<ref>Zhou, Yunzhi, [http://www.wordpedia.com/search/Content.asp?ID=56458 "Gongsun Long"]. ''[[Encyclopedia of China]]'' (Philosophy Edition), 1st ed.</ref><ref>Liu 2004, p. 336</ref>) was a member of the [[Logicians]] school of ancient [[Chinese philosophy]]. He also ran a school and enjoyed the support of rulers, and supported peaceful means of resolving disputes in contrast to the wars which were common in the period (the so-called [[Warring States Period]]). However, little is known about the particulars of his life, and furthermore many of his writings have been lost.<ref name="mcgreal">McGreal 1995, p. 31</ref> All of his essays, fourteen originally but only six still extant, are included in the book '''''Gongsun Longzi''''' (公孫龍子).

He is best known for a series of [[paradox]]es in the tradition of [[Hui Shi]]. His most famous work is ''[[White Horse Dialogue]]'', structured as conversation between two parties, with one party proclaiming truth in the statement and the other questioning.  The argument plays upon the dual semantic meanings of informal language, in particular the dual interpretations of 'is', being either:
#"Is a member of the class entitled (x)"
#"Is identical to concept (x)"
Thus a white horse is not a horse, because the concept of a white horse is not the same as the concept of a horse.

Two other paradoxes attributed to him are:
* Only the features of things can be pointed out (named), and yet the world (and other wholes) can be named even though the world (or a whole thing) is not itself a feature of anything.
* One and one cannot become two, since neither becomes two.<ref>McGreal 1995, p. 33</ref>

==White Horse Dialogue==

The ''White Horse Dialogue''(白馬論, ''Báimǎ Lùn'') can be read as a series of logical puzzles or paradoxes.  For example, the treatise gets its name from the paradox "A white horse is not a horse", which Gongsun presents therein.  The work has been viewed by some as a serious logical discourse, by others as a facetious work of [[sophistry]], and finally by some as a combination of the two.<ref name="Humor">{{cite journal | author=Harbsmeier, Christoph| title=Humor in Ancient Chinese Philosophy| journal=Philosophy East and West| year=1989| volume=39| issue=3| page=289-310| url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0031-8221%28198907%2939%3A3%3C289%3AHIACP%3E2.0.CO%3B2-B}}</ref>
