'''Education in England''' is overseen by the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] and the [[Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills]]. At a local level the [[Local government in England|local authorities]] take responsibility for implementing policy for [[public education]] and [[state school]]s. 

Full-time education is compulsory for all children aged between 5 and 16 (inclusive).  Provision is made by the state for education through to the Higher education level, and there is also a tradition of [[Independent school (UK)|independent schooling]], but parents may choose to educate their children by any suitable means.

==Primary and secondary education==
The school year begins on the 1st of September. Education is compulsory for all children from the year after they turn 5 to the year they turn 16.<ref name="School attendance">{{cite web

===The state-funded school system===
State-run schools and colleges are financed through national [[tax]]ation, and take pupils free of charge between the ages of 3 and 18.  The schools may levy charges for activities such as swimming, theatre visits and field trips, provided the charges are voluntary, thus ensuring that those who cannot afford to pay are allowed to participate in such events.  Approximately 93% of English schoolchildren attend such schools.

====School years====

In the vast majority of cases, pupils progress from primary to secondary levels at age 11; in some areas either or both of the primary and secondary levels are further subdivided.
A few areas have [[three-tier education]] systems with an intermediate middle level from age 9 to 13.

State-funded nursery education is available from the age of 3, and may be full-time or part-time.
If registered with a state school attendance is compulsory beginning with the term following the child's 5th birthday.  Children can be enrolled in the reception year in September of that school year thus beginning school at age 4 or 4.5. Unless the student chooses to stay within the education system school attendance ends on the last Friday in June during the academic year in which a student attains the age of 16.<ref name="School attendance"/>

Historically, years 7 to 12/13 used to be known as 'first form' to 'lower/upper sixth form'. There now exists a common parallel terminology for sixth form only: 'year 12/lower 6th' and 'year 13/upper 6th'. The use of the term 'sixth form' reflects its distinct, voluntary nature and situation as the [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]] years.  Even more historically, this arose from the system in [[public schools]], where all forms were divided into Lower, Upper, and sometimes Middle sections.  Year 7 is equivalent to 'Upper Third Form', Year 8 would have been known as 'Lower Fourth', and so on.

====Examinations and assessments====
[[Image:Wetherbyhighschool.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Wetherby High School]], a typical former [[secondary modern]] school in [[Wetherby]], [[West Yorkshire]]]]
Under the [[National Curriculum]] system, all pupils undergo a series of tests at specific points in their education. These are known as Key Stage [[National Curriculum assessment|National Curriculum Tests]] and are numbered 1 to 4 as follows:
 
* [[Key Stage 1]] (KS1) — during Year 2 (ages 6/7)
* [[Key Stage 2]] (KS2) — towards the end of Year 6 (ages 10/11)
* [[Key Stage 4]] (KS4) — during both Year 10 and 11, mostly at the end of Year 11 (ages 14-16) — incorporated into [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] examinations

The [[Key Stage 3]] (KS3) tests, which formerly used to happen towards the end of Year 9 (ages 13/14), were eliminated after the 2008 tests, when severe problems emerged concerning the marking procedures.

These Key Stage exams are also often referred to as [[National Curriculum assessment|SATs]] (Standard Assessment Tests).

Pupils wishing to progress in to a [[grammar school]] need to sit an additional exam, usually called the [[Eleven plus]]. The availability of grammar schools is limited by geographical location. Most areas of England no longer have grammar schools in the publicly-funded system, but there may be [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|Independent Schools]] available in the area which offer a grammar school education.

====Types of schools====

Almost all state-funded schools in England are maintained schools, which receive their funding from [[Local Education Authority|LEAs]], are are required to follow the national curriculum. In such schools, all teachers are employed under the nationally-agreed [[School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Document]].

Since 1998, there have been 4 main types of maintained school in England:<ref>{{cite web

* [[community school]]s (formerly county schools), in which the [[Local Education Authority|LEA]] employs the schools' staff, owns the schools' lands and buildings and has primary responsibility for admissions.
[[Image:StBarnabasCoEPrimarySchoolOxford.jpg|thumb|right|St Barnabas Church of England Primary School, Oxford]]
* [[voluntary controlled school]]s, which are almost always church schools, with the lands and buildings often owned by a charitable foundation. However, the [[Local Education Authority|LEA]] employs the schools' staff and has primary responsibility for admissions.
* [[voluntary aided school]]s, linked to a variety of organisations. They can be faith schools (often the [[Church of England]] or the [[Roman Catholic Church]]), or be non-denominational schools, often linked to London [[Livery Companies]] such as the Worshipful Companies of [[Worshipful Company of Haberdashers|Haberdashers]], [[Worshipful Company of Skinners|Skinners]] and [[Worshipful Company of Drapers|Drapers]]. The [[School governors|governing body]] contributes towards the capital costs of running the school, employs the staff and decides admission arrangements. The school's lands and buildings are normally owned by the charitable foundation.
* [[foundation school]]s, in which the governing body employs the staff and has primary responsibility for admissions. The school land and buildings are owned by the governing body or by a charitable foundation. The Foundation appoints the majority of [[School governors|governors]]. Many of these schools were formerly [[grant maintained school]]s. In 2005 the Labour government proposed allowing all schools to become Foundation schools if they wished.

There are also a smaller number of [[City Technology College]]s and [[Academy (English school)|academies]], which are funded and monitored directly by the Department for Children, Schools and Families.<ref>{{cite web

===Independent schools===
{{main|Independent school (UK)}}

Approximately 7% of English schoolchildren attend privately run independent schools.<ref name="DCSF statistics"/>

Education at independent schools is usually chargeable. Such schools, some of which are [[boarding schools]], cover primary and secondary education and charge between £3000 to £30000 per year{{Fact|date=November 2008}}.  Some schools offer scholarships for those with particular skills or aptitudes or [[bursary|bursaries]] to allow less well-off students to attend.

===Education otherwise than by schooling===
The Education Act requires parents to ensure their children are educated either by attending school or otherwise.  Increasing numbers of parents are choosing the otherwise option.<ref>{{cite news

==Further education and higher education==
[[Image:ShrewsburySixthFormCollege.JPG|250px|thumb|right|[[Shrewsbury Sixth Form College]] in [[Shropshire]].]]
Both state schools and independent schools take the [[GCSE]] examinations, which mark the end of compulsory education.  Above school leaving age, the independent and state sectors are similarly structured. 
In the 16-18 age group, "sixth-form" education is not compulsory. 

===Further education===
Students will typically study in either the Sixth Form of a School, a [[Sixth form college]], or a [[further education college]].
These courses can also be studied by adults over 18. This sector is referred to as [[Further Education]]. All 16-18 students are encouraged (this is only mandatory in some institutions) to study [[Key Skills Qualification|Key Skills]] in Communication, Application of Number and Information Technology.

===Higher education===
[[Image:KingsCollegeChapelWest.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The chapel of [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], [[Cambridge University]].]]
Students normally enter [[University]] from 18 onwards and study for an [[Academic Degree]].  Apart from [[University of Buckingham|a single private university]], all undergraduate education is largely state financed (with tuition fees set at a maximum index-linked £3,145 per year, repayable after graduation contingent on attaining a certain level of income, and with the state paying all fees for students from the poorest backgrounds), and UK students are generally entitled to [[student loan]]s for maintenance. The state does not control syllabuses, but it does influence admission procedures. Unlike most degrees, the state still has control over [[teacher training]] courses, and uses [[Ofsted]] inspectors to maintain standards.<ref>{{cite web

The typical [[first degree]] offered at British universities is the [[Bachelor's degree]] (typically three years). Many institutions now offer an undergraduate [[Master's degree]] as a first degree, typically lasting four years. During a [[first degree]] students are known as [[undergraduate]]s. The difference in fees between [[undergraduate]] and traditional [[postgraduate]] Master's degrees (and the possibility of securing LEA funding for the former) makes taking an undergraduate [[Master's degree]] as a [[first degree]] a more attractive option, although the novelty of undergraduate Master's degrees means that the relative educational merit of the two is currently unclear.

Some universities offer a vocationally-based [[Foundation degree]], typically two years in length for those students who hope to continue to take a [[first degree]] but wish to remain in employment.

====Postgraduate education====
Students who have completed a [[first degree]] are eligible to undertake a [[postgraduate]] degree, which includes:

* [[Master's degree]] (typically taken in one year)
* [[Doctorate|Doctorate degree]] (typically taken in three years)

Postgraduate education is not automatically financed by the State, and so admission is in practice highly competitive.

====Specialist qualifications====
* Education: [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education]] (PGCE), [[Certificate in Education]] (Cert Ed), [[City and Guilds of London Institute|C&G]] 7407 or [[Bachelor of Education]] (BA or BEd), most of which also incorporate [[Qualified Teacher Status]] ([[QTS]]).
* Law: [[Bachelor of Laws]] LL.B. 
* Medicine: [[Bachelors of Medicine and Surgery]] studied at [[Medical school (United Kingdom)]]
* Business: [[Master of Business Administration]] MBA.

====Fees====
Undergraduates pay up to £3000 per annum (capped) in [[top-up fees]] and Postgraduates typically pay £3000 per annum however some institutions charge more.  There are numerous bursaries (awarded to low income applicants) to offset the undergraduate fees, and for postgraduates, full scholarships are available for most subjects which are awarded competitively.  Differing arrangements apply to English students studying in [[Education in Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Education in Scotland|Scottish]] / [[Education in Wales|Welsh]] students studying in England.  Non UK students at English universities are charged differing amounts, often in the region of £5000 - £20000 per annum{{Fact|date=November 2008}} for undergraduate and postgraduate degrees. The actual amount differs by institution and subject with the lab based subjects charging a greater amount.

==Adult education==
[[Adult education]], [[Continuing education]] or [[Lifelong learning]] is offered to students of all ages. These can include the vocational qualifications mentioned above and also:
* [[Access programme]] one or two year courses to allow adults access to university.
* [[Open University]] a distance learning program which can result in a Degree.
* [[Workers' Educational Association]]
A large number of semi-recreational courses, with or without qualifications, are made available by Local Education Authorities under the guise of Adult Education, such as holiday languages, crafts and yacht navigation.
