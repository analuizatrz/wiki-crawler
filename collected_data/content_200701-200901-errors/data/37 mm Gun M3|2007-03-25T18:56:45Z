The '''37mm Gun M3''' was the first dedicated [[anti-tank gun]] fielded by the [[United States|US]] forces. Introduced in 1940, it became the standard anti-tank gun of the US [[infantry]], until replaced in this role by more powerful [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder|57mm Gun M1]] in 1943-44. By that time, the evolution of [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[tank]]s rendered the 37 mm piece ineffective. In the Pacific, where the armor threat was less significant, the M3 remained in service until the end of the war. Like many other light anti-tank guns, the M3 was widely used as infantry support and an anti-personnel weapon, firing [[Shell (projectile)#High-explosive (HE)|high-explosive]] and [[canister shot|canister]] rounds.

In one of the tank-mounted variants (M5 or M6), the gun was used in several models of armored vehicles, most notably the [[Stuart tank|Light Tank M3/M5]], the [[Lee tank|Medium Tank M3]] and the [[M8 Greyhound|Light Armored Car M8]]. In addition, M3 in its original version was mated to a number of other self-propelled carriages.

==Development history==
In mid-1930s the [[US Army]] had yet to field a dedicated anti-tank gun; anti-tank [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of infantry [[regiment]]s were armed with .50-cal [[machine gun]]s. Although there were some considerations of replacing the MGs with more powerful weapon, only after the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] the situation started to change. The war was characterized by a growth of the tank threat, but the combat experience suggested that light anti-tank gun, such as the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[3.7 cm PaK 36|PaK 35/36]], gives an adequate solution.<ref name="ZALOGADELF3to7">Zaloga, Delf - ''US Anti-tank Artillery 1941-45'', p 3-7.</ref>

In January [[1937]], inspired by reports about successful use of anti-tank guns in Spain, the [[Ordnance Corps|Ordnance Committee]] recommended development of a such a weapon;<ref name="ZALOGADELF3to7">Zaloga, Delf - ''US Anti-tank Artillery 1941-45'', p 3-7.</ref> two PaK 36 guns were acquired for study.<ref name="HOGG149">Hogg, Ian V. - ''Allied Artillery of World War Two'', p 149.</ref> The Infantry branch was chosen to oversee the work as the future main user of the weapon. The Infantry wanted a lightweight gun which could be moved around by the crew, so any ideas of using larger caliber then that of the German gun were brushed aside.<ref name="ZALOGADELF3to7"/>

Development and testing continued until late [[1938]]. Several variants of gun and carriage were proposed until on [[15 December]] a combination of T10 gun and T5 carriage was officially adopted as 37mm Gun M3 and Carriage M4.<ref name="ZALOGADELF3to7"/> Although patterned after PaK 36 and often referred to as a copy of it<ref>E.g. see Rottman, Chapell - ''The US Marine Corps 1941-45'', p 17: "M3A1 ... was copied from the standard German AT gun".</ref>, the M3 differed significantly from the German design, including different breech mechanism, longer barrel with different rifling, different cartridge etc..

The gun was manufactured by [[Watervliet Arsenal]] and the carriage by [[Rock Island Arsenal]]. First pieces were delivered early in [[1940]].<ref name="ZALOGADELF3to7"/> The production continued until  [[1943]].

Some minor changes in the gun construction were introduced during the production period. The carriage received modified shoulder guard and traverse controls (carriage M4A1, standardized on [[29 January]] [[1942]]); although Ordnance requested upgrade of all M4 carriages to M4A1, the process wasn't completed.<ref name="ZALOGADELF3to7"/> Other change was threaded [[Gun barrel|barrel]] end to accept a big five-port [[muzzle brake]] (gun M3A1, adopted on [[5 March]] 1942). According to Zaloga,<ref name="ZALOGADELF3to7"/> the latter was intended to avoid kicking too much dust under dry ground conditions; it turned out to be a safety problem when used with [[Case shot|canister ammunition]] and consequently never saw combat. Other sources mention the muzzle break as intended to soften a recoil and say that it was dropped simply because additional recoil control measures weren't really needed.<ref name="HOGG149"/><ref name="CHAMBERLAINGANDER47">Chamberlain, Peter and Gander, Terry - ''Anti-Tank Weapons'', p 47.</ref>

In attempt to increase the armor penetration of the M3 several squeeze bore adapters (including the British [[Littlejohn adaptor]]) were tested; none were adopted. Experiments with rocket launchers on the M4 carriage (e.g. 4.5in rocket projector T3) also didn't produce anything practical.<ref name="ZALOGADELF3to7"/>

==Description==
The barrel was of one-piece forged construction, with uniform rifling (12 grooves, right-hand twist, one turn in 25 calibers). The breech end of the barrel was screwed into a breech ring. The breech mechanism was of vertical sliding block type. The barrel was fitted with a hydrospring recoil system.<ref name=TM-9-2005>''Technical Manual TM 9-2005 volume 3, Infantry and Cavalry Accompanying Weapons'', p 11-15.</ref>

The carriage was of split trail type, with pneumatic tires.<ref name=TM-9-2005/> Mounted on the axle next to the wheels were the "wheel segments" -  segment-shaped supports that could be lowered to provide more stability in firing position or raised so they wouldn't impede moving the gun.

The telescopic sight M6 and both elevation and traverse controls were located on the left side, so one gunner was able to aim the gun. The traverse gear had release mechanism which allowed free movement of the barrel in case quick traverse was needed.<ref name=TM-9-2005/>

==Organization and employment==

Under the organization active in [[1941]], each infantry [[battalion]] had an anti-tank [[platoon]] with three 37 mm guns and each regiment an anti-tank company with nine, totaling 18 pieces per regiment. 3/4 ton trucks were assigned as prime movers, but many units received the [[Willys MB|1/4 ton truck]] (better known as the jeep) instead. Two 37mm companies were also supposed to be a part of the [[Division (military)|divisional]] anti-tank battalion (along with eight [[Canon de 75 modèle 1897|75 mm guns]]); in December 1941 these battalions were reorganized as independent tank destroyer battalions and eventually opted for self-propelled anti-tank guns.<ref name="ZALOGADELF9to12">Zaloga, Delf - ''US Anti-tank Artillery 1941-45'', p 9-12.</ref> An airborne division had 36 37 mm anti-tank guns under organization of October [[1942]]: four in divisional artillery, eight in [[glider]] infantry regiment, 24 in AA/AT battalion.<ref name="ZALOGADELF23to24">Zaloga, Delf - ''US Anti-tank Artillery 1941-45'', p 23, 24.</ref>

In [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] service, prior to 1943 the role of AT weapons was officially entrusted to 20 mm automatic guns in regimental and battalion weapon companies, though in practice units used the 37mm M1916 for training  and were equipped with the M3 (four in each battalion and additional 12 in a regiment, in three platoons of four) before being sent to the frontline.<ref>Rottman, Gordon - ''US Marine Corps Pacific Theater of Operations 1941-43'', p 25-26.</ref> Under the E-series Table of Organization from [[15 April]] [[1943]], a marine division had a special weapons battalion with 18 37 mm guns in three batteries of six and an infantry regiment had a weapons company with 12, in three platoons of four, totaling 54 pieces per division. The F-series TO ([[5 May]] [[1944]]) removed the special weapons battalion from the divisional organization and the G-series TO (officially from [[4 September]] [[1945]], but in practice implemented late in the war for some units) reduced the weapon company to two platoons, resulting in a total of 36 and 24 pieces per division accordingly.<ref>History of U.S. Marine Corps Operations in World War II, Vol II: Table of Organization E-100; Vol III: Table of Organization F-100; Rottman, Chapell - ''The US Marine Corps 1941-45'', p 5-8; ww2gyrene: The Marine Division; ww2gyrene: M3A1 37mm Antitank Gun.</ref>

The M3 saw action for the first time during the [[Battle of the Philippines (1941-42)|defense of the Philippines]] in December 1941.<ref name="ZALOGADELF9to12"/> Throughout the war it remained effective against [[Japan|Japanese]] vehicles (which were thinly armored and, moreover, were rarely committed in large groups) and its weight allowed manhandling with relative ease (e.g. when attacked by Japanese tanks on [[Battle of Tarawa|Betio]], marines were able to manually heave the M3 over the five-foot-high seawall<ref name="ROTTMANCHAPELL12">Rottman, Chapell - ''The US Marine Corps 1941-45'', p 12-13.</ref>). Because of those factors, the gun remained in service with the Marine Corps until the end of the war, being employed as both an anti-tank and an infantry support piece (though in the latter role the M3 with its small high-explosive projectile was only somewhat effective); firing a canister ammunition proved useful in stopping Japanese infantry attacks. Some Army units in the [[Pacific War|Pacific]] also used the gun until the end of the hostilities.<ref name="ZALOGADELF9to12"/> Unhappy with the unusually low shield of the M3, some Marine Corps units extended it to provide better protection. A standard kit was tested in 1945, but was never issued.<ref>Zaloga, Delf - ''US Anti-tank Artillery 1941-45'', p 6, 46.</ref>

The experience of the [[North African Campaign]] was completely different. The gun was soon found out to be not powerful enough to deal with late production [[Panzer III]] and [[Panzer IV]]. After the nearly disastrous [[Battle of Kasserine Pass]] in February [[1943]], reports from some of the involved units mentioned 37 mm projectiles "bouncing off like marbles" from turret and front armor of [[Nazi Germany|German]] medium tanks and proclaimed the gun "useless unless you have gun crews with the guts to stand and shoot from 100 yards". The Army was initially uncertain if these reports reflected the obsolescence of the weapon rather than unrefined tactics and lack of experience, but on [[26 May]] 1943 a new organization had the M3 replaced by the ''57mm Gun M1'' (the US-produced version of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder|QF 6 pounder]]), with Dodge 1 1/2 ton trucks as prime movers. But only by spring [[1944]] did the 57mm gun reach the battlefield in large numbers.<ref name="ZALOGADELF9to12"/>

Meanwhile, the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]] was launched. On the day of the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Sicily landing]] - [[10 July]] 1943 - M3 guns helped to repel an attack by Italian [[R 35|Renault R 35]] tanks, but were inefficient in a subsequent encounter with [[Tiger I|Tigers]] from the [[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann Göring|Herman Göring division]]. The Italian theater had lower priority for reequipment than Northwest Europe, and some M3s were still in use there late in 1944.<ref>Zaloga, Delf - ''US Anti-tank Artillery 1941-45'', p 21, 22.</ref>

By mid-1944 the M3 fell out of favor even with airborne troops, despite their strong preference for compact and lightweight weapon systems. Although the Airborne Command rejected the 57 mm M1 in summer of 1943 claiming its unfitness for airlifting<ref>Zaloga, Delf - ''US Anti-tank Artillery 1941-45'', p 14.</ref>, and although the organization of February 1944 still had airborne divisions keep their 37 mm guns, before the [[Battle of Normandy#Airborne landings|Normandy airdrops]] the two divisions involved - the [[U.S. 82nd Airborne Division|82nd]] and the [[101st Airborne Division|101st]] - were reequipped with British-manufactured 6 pounders, of a version designed to fit into the [[Airspeed Horsa|Horsa glider]].<ref name="ZALOGADELF23to24"/>

The only major [[lend lease]] recipient of the M3 was the Chinese [[Kuomintang|Kuomintang Army]] (1,669 pieces). The gun was also supplied to [[Bolivia]] (4), [[Canada]] (3), [[Chile]] (198), [[Colombia]] (4), [[Cuba]] (1), [[El Salvador]] (9), [[France]] (130), [[Great Britain]] (78), [[USSR]] (63) and other countries (100).<ref>Zaloga, Delf - ''US Anti-tank Artillery 1941-45'', p 44.</ref> 

While the US forces retired the gun soon after the end of the war, some nations still had the gun in service in early 1970s.<ref name="CHAMBERLAINGANDER47"/>

Two tank gun variants were developed based on the barrel of the M3. The first, initially designated M3A1 but renamed M5 on [[13 October]] 1939, was shortened by 5.1 inches (3.5 calibers) to avoid damage to the tube in wooden areas. Later a variant with semi-automatic breech (with empty cartridge ejection) was developed. This variant - M5E1, adopted as M6 on [[14 November]] 1940) - received a full length barrel. The tubes were interchangeable, but replacing M5 with M6 and vice versa would result in unbalanced mount and was therefore prohibited.<ref name="HUNNICUTT-STUART-118and143">Hunnicutt, R. P. - ''Stuart: A History of the American Light Tank.'', p 118, 143.</ref> These guns were mounted on several models of tanks and other armored vehicles:
*[[M2 Light Tank|Light Tank M2A4]]: M5 in mount M20. The recoil mechanism, protruding beyond the gun mask, had to be protected by an armored casing.<ref>Hunnicutt, R. P. - ''Stuart: A History of the American Light Tank.'', p 119, 143.</ref>
*[[Stuart tank|Light Tank M3]]: M5 in mount M22, in late production vehicles M6 in mount M23. These mounts were fitted with more compact recoil mechanism, eliminating the need for the protective casing.<ref>Hunnicutt, R. P. - ''Stuart: A History of the American Light Tank.'', p 127, 143.</ref>

Versions of the gun in turret mounts were also used in the [[Medium Tank T5|Medium Tank T5 Phase III]] (T3 barrel, mount T1)<ref>Hunnicutt, R. P. - ''Sherman: A History of the American Medium Tank.'', p 34.</ref>, in the [[M2 Medium Tank|Medium Tank M2 / M2A1]] (M3 barrel, M2A1: mount M19),<ref>Hunnicutt, R.

P. - ''Stuart: A History of the American Light Tank.'', p 303.</ref>

In addition, M3 in its original configuration was mated to a number of other vehicles resulting in an assortment of 37mm gun motor carriages:
