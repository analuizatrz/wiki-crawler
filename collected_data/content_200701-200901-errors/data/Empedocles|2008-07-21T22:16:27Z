'''Empedocles''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{Polytonic|Ἐμπεδοκλῆς}}, ca. 490–430 BC) was a [[Hellenic civilization|Greek]] [[pre-Socratic]] [[philosopher]] and a citizen of [[Agrigentum]], a Greek colony in [[Sicily]]. Empedocles' philosophy is best known for being the origin of the [[cosmogenesis|cosmogenic]] theory of the four [[classical elements]]. He also proposed powers called Love and Strife which would act as forces to bring about the mixture and separation of the elements. These physical speculations were part of a history of the [[universe]] which also dealt with the origin and development of [[life]]. Influenced by the [[Pythagoreans]], he supported the doctrine of [[reincarnation]]. Some of Empedocles' work still survives today, more so than in the case of any other Presocratic philosopher. Empedocles' death was mythologized by ancient writers, and has been the subject of a number of literary treatments.

==Life==
[[Image:Agrigento Tempio di Hera.jpg|left|thumb|The temple of [[Hera]] at [[Agrigentum]], built when Empodecles was a young man, c. 470 BC.]]
Empedocles was born, c. 490 BC, at [[Agrigentum]] (Acragas) in [[Sicily]] to a distinguished family.<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 51</ref> Very little is known about his life. His father Meto seems to have been instrumental in overthrowing the tyrant of Agrigentum, presumably [[Thrasydaeus]] in 470 BC. Empedocles continued the [[democratic]] tradition of his house by helping to overthrow the succeeding [[oligarchic]] government. He is said to have been magnanimous in his support of the poor;<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 73</ref> severe in persecuting the overbearing conduct of the [[Aristocracy|aristocrats]];<ref>Timaeus, ap. Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 64, comp. 65, 66</ref> and he even declined the sovereignty of the city when it was offered to him.<ref>Aristotle ap. Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 63; compare, however, Timaeus, ap. Diogenes Laërtius, 66, 76</ref>

His brilliant [[oratory]],<ref>Satyrus, ap. Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 58; Timaeus, ap. Diogenes Laërtius, 67</ref> his penetrating knowledge of [[nature]], and the reputation of his marvellous powers, including the curing of [[diseases]], and averting [[epidemics]],<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 60, 70, 69; Plutarch, ''de Curios. Princ.'', ''adv. Colotes''; Pliny, ''H. N.'' xxxvi. 27, and others</ref> produced many [[myths]] and [[narrative|stories]] surrounding his name. He was said to have been a [[Magician (paranormal)|magician]] and controller of [[storms]], and he himself, in his famous poem ''Purifications'' seems to have promised miraculous powers, including the destruction of [[evil]], the curing of [[old age]], and the controlling of [[wind]] and [[rain]]. 

Empedocles was acquainted or connected by friendship with the physicians [[Acron]] and [[Pausanias of Sicily|Pausanias]],  who was his [[eromenos]];<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 60, 61, 65, 69; Plutarch, ''de Is. et Os.''; Pliny, ''H. N.'' xxix. 3; Suda, ''Empedocles''</ref> with various [[Pythagoreans]]; and even, it is said, with [[Parmenides]] and [[Anaxagoras]].<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 55, 56, etc.</ref> The only pupil of Empedocles who is mentioned is the [[sophist]] and [[rhetorician]] [[Gorgias]].<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 58</ref>

[[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]] and [[Dicaearchus]] spoke of the journey of Empedocles to the [[Peloponnese]], and of the admiration which was paid to him there;<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 71, 67; Athenaeus, xiv.</ref> others mentioned his stay at [[Athens]], and in the newly-founded colony of [[Thurii]], 446 BC;<ref>Suda, ''Akron''; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 52</ref> there are also fanciful reports of him travelling far to the east to the lands of the [[Magi]].<ref>Pliny, ''H. N.'' xxx. 1, etc.</ref> 

According to [[Aristotle]], he died at the age of sixty, (c. 430 BC) even though other writers have him living up to the age of one hundred and nine.<ref>Apollonius, ap. Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 52, comp. 74, 73</ref> Likewise, there are myths concerning his death: a tradition, which is traced to [[Heraclides Ponticus]], represented him as having been removed from the [[earth]]; whereas others had him perishing in the flames of [[Mount Etna]].<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 67, 69, 70, 71; Horace, ''ad Pison.'' 464, etc.</ref>

==Works==
Empedocles is considered the last Greek philosopher to write in [[verse]] and the surviving fragments of his teaching are from two poems, ''Purifications'' and ''On Nature''. Empedocles was undoubtedly acquainted with the didactic poems of [[Xenophanes]] and [[Parmenides]]<ref>Hermippus and Theophrastus, ap. Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 55, 56</ref> - allusions to the latter can be found in the fragments, - but he seems to have surpassed them in the animation and richness of his style, and in the clearness of his descriptions and diction. [[Aristotle]] called him the father of [[rhetoric]], and, although he acknowledged only the [[Meter (poetry)|meter]] as a point of comparison between the poems of Empedocles and the epics of [[Homer]], he described Empedocles as Homeric and powerful in his diction.<ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'', 1, ap. Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 57.</ref> [[Lucretius]] speaks of him with enthusiasm, and evidently viewed him as his model.<ref>See especially Lucretius, i. 716, etc.</ref> The two poems together comprised 5000 lines.<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 58.</ref> About 550 lines of his poetry survive, although because ancient writers rarely mentioned which poem they were quoting, it is not always certain to which poem the quotes belong. Some scholars now believe that there was only one poem, and that the ''Purifications'' merely formed the beginning of ''On Nature''.<ref>Simon Trépanier, (2004), ''Empedocles: An Interpretation'', Routledge.</ref>

===''Purifications''===
We possess only about 100 lines of his ''Purifications''. It seems to have given a [[mythical]] account of the world which may, nevertheless, have been part of Empedocles' philosophical system. The first lines of the poem are preserved by [[Diogenes Laërtius]]:

<blockquote>Friends who inhabit the mighty town by tawny Acragas<br>
which crowns the citadel, caring for good deeds,<br>
greetings; I, an immortal God, no longer mortal,<br>
wander among you, honoured by all,<br>
adorned with holy diadems and blooming garlands.<br>
To whatever illustrious towns I go,<br>
I am praised by men and women, and accompanied<br>
by thousands, who thirst for deliverance,<br>
some ask for prophecies, and some entreat,<br>
for remedies against all kinds of disease.<ref>Frag. B112, (Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 61)</ref></blockquote>

It was probably this work which contained a story about [[souls]],<ref>Frag. B115, (Plutarch, ''On Exile'', 607CE; Hippolytus, vii. 29)</ref> where we are told that there were once spirits who lived in a state of bliss, but having committed a [[crime]] (the nature of which is unknown) they were punished by being forced to become mortal beings, [[reincarnated]] from body to body. [[Humans]], [[animals]], and even [[plants]] are such spirits. The moral conduct recommended in the poem may allow us to become like [[gods]] again.

===''On Nature''===
There are about 450 lines of his poem ''On Nature'' extant, including 70 lines which have been reconstructed from some papyrus scraps known as the ''Strasbourg Papyrus''. The poem originally consisted of 2000 lines of [[hexameter]] verse,<ref>Suda, ''Empedocles''</ref> and was addressed to [[Pausanias of Sicily|Pausanias]].<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 60</ref> It was this poem which outlined his philosophical system. In it, Empedocles explains not only the nature and history of the [[universe]], including his theory of the four [[classical elements]], but he describes theories on causation, perception, and thought, as well as explanations of [[earth|terrestrial]] phenomena and [[biological processes]].

==Philosophy==
[[Image:Empedocles-2-sized.jpg|right|thumb|Empedocles as portrayed in the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]]]]
Although acquainted with the theories of the [[Eleatics]] and the [[Pythagoreans]], Empedocles did not belong to any one definite school. An [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] in his thinking, he combined much that had been suggested by [[Parmenides]], [[Pythagoras]] and the [[Ionian school]]s. He was both a firm believer in [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic mysteries]], as well as a [[scientific]] thinker and a precursor of [[physics|physical science]]. Aristotle mentions Empedocles among the Ionic philosophers, and he places him in very close relation to the [[atomism|atomist]] philosophers and to [[Anaxagoras]].<ref>Aristotle, ''Metaphysics,'' i. 3, 4, 7, ''Phys.'' i. 4, ''de General, et Corr.'' i. 8, ''de Caelo'', iii. 7.</ref>

Empedocles, like the Ionian philosophers and the atomists, tried to find the basis of all [[change]]. They did not, like [[Heraclitus]], consider the coming into [[existence]] and motion as the existence of things, and rest and tranquillity as the non-existence, because they had derived from the Eleatics the conviction that an existence could not pass into non-existence, and vice versa. In order to allow change to occur in the world, against the views of the Eleatics, they viewed changes as the result of mixture and separation of unalterable substances. Thus Empedocles said that a coming into existence from a non-existence, as well as a complete death and annihilation, are impossible; what we call coming into existence and death is only [[mixture]] and separation of what was mixed.<ref>Frag. B8, (Plutarch, ''Against Colotes'', 1111F); Frag. B12, (Pseudo-Aristotle, ''On Melissus, Xenophanes, Gorgias'', 975a36-b6)</ref>

===The four elements===
It was Empedocles who established four ultimate [[classical elements|elements]] which make all the structures in the world - [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]].<ref>Frag. B17, (Simplicius, ''Physics'', 157-159)</ref> Empedocles called these four elements "roots", which, in typical fashion, he also identified with the mythical names of [[Zeus]], [[Hera]], [[Persephone|Nestis]], and [[Aidoneus]].<ref>Frag. B6, (Sextus Empiricus, ''Against the Mathematicians'', x, 315.)</ref> Empedocles never used the term "element" ({{lang-el|στοιχεῖον}}), which seems to have been first used by [[Plato]].<ref>Plato, ''Timaeus'', 48b-c</ref> According to the different proportions in which these four indestructible and unchangeable elements are combined with each other the difference of the structure is produced. It is in the aggregation and segregation of elements thus arising, that Empedocles, like the atomists, found the real process which corresponds to what is popularly termed growth, increase or decrease. Nothing new comes or can come into being; the only change that can occur is a change in the juxtaposition of element with element. This theory of the four elements became the standard [[dogma]] for the next two thousand years.

===Love and Strife===
The four elements are, however, simple, eternal, and unalterable, and as change is the consequence of their mixture and separation, it was also necessary to suppose the existence of moving powers - to bring about mixture and separation. The four elements are eternally brought into union, and eternally parted from each other, by two divine powers, [[Love]] and [[Hate|Strife]]. Love ({{lang-el|φιλία}}) explains the attraction of different forms of matter, and Strife ({{lang-el|νεῖκος}}) accounts for their separation.<ref>Frag. B35, B26, (Simplicius, ''Physics'', 31-34)</ref> If the elements are the content of the universe, then Love and Strife explain their variation and harmony. Love and Strife are attractive and repulsive [[forces]] which the ordinary [[eye]] can see working amongst [[people]], but which really pervade the [[universe]]. They alternately hold empire over things, - neither, however, being ever quite absent.

===The sphere of Empedocles===
As the best and original state, there was a time when the pure elements and the two powers co-existed in a condition of rest and inertness in the form of a [[sphere]]. The elements existed together in their purity, without mixture and separation, and the uniting power of Love predominated in the sphere: the separating power of Strife guarded the extreme edges of the sphere.<ref>Frag. B35, (Simplicius, ''Physics'', 31-34; ''On the Heavens'', 528-530)</ref> Since that time, strife gained more sway and the bond which kept the pure elementary substances together in the sphere was dissolved. The elements became the world of phaenomena we see today, full of contrasts and oppositions, operated on by both Love and Strife. The sphere being the embodiment of pure existence is the embodiment or representative of [[god]]. Empedocles assumed a cyclical universe whereby the elements return and prepare the formation of the sphere for the next period of the universe. 

===Cosmogony===
Since the time of the sphere, Strife has gained more sway; and the actual world is full of contrasts and oppositions, due to the combined action of both principles. Empedocles attempted to explain the separation of elements, the formation of [[earth]] and [[sea]], of [[sun]] and [[moon]], of [[atmosphere]]. He also dealt with the first origin of [[plants]] and [[animals]], and with the [[physiology]] of humans. As the elements entered into combinations, there appeared strange results - [[heads]] without [[neck]]s, [[arms]] without [[shoulders]].<ref>Frag. B57, (Simplicius, ''On the Heavens'', 586)</ref> Then as these fragmentary structures met, there were seen [[horned]] heads on human bodies, bodies of [[oxen]] with human heads, and figures of [[intersexuality|double sex]].<ref>Frag. B61, (Aelian, ''On Animals'', xvi 29)</ref> But most of these products of natural forces disappeared as suddenly as they arose; only in those rare cases where the parts were found to be [[adapted]] to each other, did the complex structures last. Thus the organic universe sprang from spontaneous aggregations, which suited each other as if this had been intended. Soon various influences reduced the creatures of double sex to a [[male]] and a [[female]], and the world was replenished with organic [[life]]. It is possible (although [[anachronistic]]) to see this theory as a crude anticipation of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] theory of [[natural selection]].

===Perception and knowledge===
[[Knowledge]] is explained by the principle that the elements in the things outside us are perceived by the corresponding elements in ourselves.<ref>Frag. B109, (Aristotle, ''On the Soul'', 404b11-15)</ref> Like is known by like. The whole body is full of [[pores]], (and hence [[respiration]] takes place over the whole frame). In the organs of sense these pores are specially adapted to receive the effluences which are continually rising from bodies around us; and in this way [[perception]] is explained.<ref>Frag. B100, (Aristotle, ''On Respiration'', 473b1-474a6)</ref> Thus in [[Visual perception|vision]], certain particles go forth from the [[eye]] to meet similar particles given forth from the object, and the resultant contact constitutes vision.<ref>Frag. B84, (Aristotle, ''On the Senses and their Objects'', 437b23-438a5)</ref> Perception is not merely a passive [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] of external objects.

Empedocles noted the limitation and narrowness of human perceptions. We see only a part, but fancy that we have grasped the whole. But the senses cannot lead to [[truth]]; thought and reflection must look at the thing on every side. It is the business of a [[philosopher]], while laying bare the fundamental difference of elements, to display the identity that exists between what seem unconnected parts of the universe.<ref>Frag. B2, (Sextus Empiricus, ''Against the Mathematicians'', vii. 123-125)</ref>

===Reincarnation===
Like [[Pythagoras]], Empedocles believed in the [[transmigration of the soul]]. Souls can be reincarnated between humans, animals and even plants.<ref>Frag. B127, (Aelian, ''On Animals'', xii. 7); Frag. B117, (Hippolytus, i. 3.2)</ref> For Empedocles, all living things were on the same spiritual plane; plants and animals are links in a chain where humans are a link too. Empedocles urged a [[vegetarian]] lifestyle, since the bodies of animals are the dwelling places of punished souls.<ref>Sextus Empiricus, ''Against the Mathematicians'', ix. 127; Hippolytus, vii. 21</ref> [[Wisdom|Wise]] people, who have learned the secret of life, are next to the [[divinity|divine]],<ref>Clement of Alexandria, ''Miscellanies'', iv. 23.150</ref> and their souls, free from the cycle of reincarnations are able to rest in [[happiness]] for [[eternity]].<ref>Clement of Alexandria, ''Miscellanies'', v. 14.122</ref>

==Death and literary treatments==
[[Diogenes Laërtius]] records the legend that he died by throwing himself into an active [[volcano]] ([[Mount Etna]] in [[Sicily]]), so that people would believe his body had vanished and he had turned into an immortal god; however, the volcano threw back one of his bronze [[sandals]], revealing the deceit. Another legend has it that he threw himself in the volcano to prove to his disciples that he was immortal; he believed he would come back as a god among man after being devoured by the fire.

In ''Icaro-Menippus'', a comedic dialogue written by the second century satirist [[Lucian of Samosata]], Empedocles’s final fate is re-evaluated. Rather than being incinerated in the fires of Mount Etna, he was carried up into the heavens by a volcanic eruption. Although a bit singed by the ordeal, Empedocles survives and continues his life on the [[moon]], surviving by feeding on dew.

Empedocles' death has inspired two major modern literary treatments. Empedocles's death is the subject of [[Friedrich Hölderlin]]'s play ''Tod des Empedokles'' (''Death of Empedocles''), two versions of which were written between the years 1798 and 1800. A third version was made public in 1826. In [[Matthew Arnold]]'s poem ''Empedocles on Etna'', a narrative of the philosopher's last hours before he jumps to his death in the crater first published in 1852, Empedocles predicts:

:''To the elements it came from''
:''Everything will return.''
:''Our bodies to earth,''
:''Our blood to water,''
:''Heat to fire,''
:''Breath to air.''

In 2006, a massive underwater volcano off the coast of Sicily was named [[Empedocles (volcano)|Empedocles]].<ref>BBC News, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5108360.stm ''Underwater volcano found by Italy''], 23 June 2006</ref>
