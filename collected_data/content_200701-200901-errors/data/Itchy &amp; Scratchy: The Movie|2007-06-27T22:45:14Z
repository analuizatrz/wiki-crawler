"'''Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie'''" is the 6th episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[List of The Simpsons episodes#Season 4 (1992-1993)|fourth season]]. It first aired on [[3 November]] [[1992]]. As punishment for Bart's misbehavior, Homer bans him from seeing the new Itchy & Scratchy movie forever.

==Plot==
After a Parent Night at [[Springfield Elementary]], Mrs. Krabappel tells Marge how she should discipline Bart more. Homer tries to, but Bart makes several successful attempts to escape the punishments. Knowing the new Itchy and Scratchy Movie is coming to theaters, Bart buys himself a ticket. He is then in charge of babysitting for Maggie, but she escapes, driving Homer's car and smashing it to the Springfield Penitiary, giving many criminals an easy escape. Homer angrily blames Bart for the incident and punishes him by forbidding him to go to see the Itchy and Scratchy movie. Homer then takes Bart's ticket away and rips it. Bart says that he's willing to take any other punishment and begs to see the movie, but Homer doesn't relent. Once the movie comes out, Bart becomes very jealous of others who see the movie, including Nelson and Milhouse, who then chase after Bart together to beat him up for not seeing the movie. Bart tries to go see the movie by pleading and behaving well, but Homer still refuses. Bart also tries to sneak out, but Homer foils it, knowing that he contacted the movie theaters not to sell any tickets to Bart. After two months, Marge and Lisa, feeling sorry for Bart, plead to  Homer to let him see the movie, but Homer still doesn't relent. Homer knows that Bart is feeling desperate to see the movie, but he believes that if he fails to make at least some good effort to discipline Bart now, he will never become something successful, like [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]. Once the movie moves out of the theaters, Bart concedes defeat to Homer. Forty years later, Bart becomes Chief Justice of the United States, and finds out that the movie is back in theaters at its second billing, knowing that it's now considered a classic. Bart decides to watch the movie for the first time. Homer, who is now an old man, knowing that Bart learned his lesson, joins him.

==Cultural references==
*''[[60 Minutes]]'' - Homer's threat of sending Grampa to the "crooked home we saw on ''60 Minutes''" (after he mumbles incoherently following Bart's prank) is a reference to the CBS [[newsmagazine]] and the investigative reports into nursing home abuse that aired on it.

==Trivia==
{{Trivia|date=June 2007}}
*The headlights of Homer's car blink when he honks the car's horn.
*In 2032, the "Do not sell to this boy" poster is still hanging there, though it isn't drawn very well.
*Originally, the Itchy and Scratchy movie was supposed to be shown as the most violent, twisted cartoon ever, but the writers changed it to be just an ordinary episode of [[Itchy and Scratchy]].
* In the year 2032, a man in the theaters asks for soylent green, afterwards homer says ''"mmmmmm...................soyyyylent...."'', in reference to the film [[Soylent Green]].
*When Lisa says, "You wouldn't believe all the celebrities who had cameos! Dustin Hoffman! Michael Jackson! Of course, they didn't use their real names, but you could tell it was them!", she is subtly referencing the actual appearances of Hoffman, under the fake name 'Sam Etic' in "Lisa's Substitute" and Jackson, under 'John Jay Smith' in "Stark Raving Dad".
*When Homer calls Bart "the boy you love to hate", it may be a possible reference to rapper [[Ice Cube]], who was popular at the time the episode originally aired and was known as "the nigga you love to hate". However, the epithet "the man you love to hate" was originally used for actor/director [[Erich von Stroheim]], notorious for playing villains.
*This episode originally aired in [[North America]] on a Tuesday, rather than the usual Thursday, as part of a comedy lineup on Fox, while the other three major networks were broadcasting the presidential election results.
