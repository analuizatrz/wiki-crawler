Father '''Ferdinand Verbiest''' ([[October 9]] [[1623]] – [[January 28]] [[1688]]) was a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] in [[China]]. He is known as Nan Huairen (南懷仁) in Chinese.

Around [[1670]] Verbiest, so it is claimed, developed what may have been the first ever [[automobile]].

== Background ==
Born at [[Pittem]] near [[Kortrijk]], Belgium, Verbiest studied in [[Leuven]], [[Mechelen]], [[Sevilla]] and [[Rome]]. He entered the [[Society of Jesus]] on [[September 2]] [[1641]]. In 1658 he accompanied Father [[Martino Martini]] to [[China]] and reached [[Macao]] in [[1659]]. He led the mission in [[Shanxi]] until 1660, when he was called to assist, and later replace, Father [[Adam Schall von Bell]] in Beijing in his work in [[astronomy]]. He would assist the [[Kangxi Emperor]] in various ways, including creating [[star chart]]s for him in order to tell the time at night.<ref name="spence 15 16">Spence, 15&ndash;16.</ref>

Veriest died in [[Beijing]] shortly after receiving a wound from falling off a bolting horse.<ref name="spence 12">Spence, 12.</ref> He was succeeded as the chief mathematician and astronomer of the Chinese empire by another [[Belgian]] Jesuit, [[Antoine Thomas]] (1644-1709). His remains were buried near those of another famous Jesuit [[Matteo Ricci]] on [[March 11]], [[1688]]. Verbiest was the only Westerner in Chinese history to ever receive the honour of a posthumous name by the Emperor.

== Verbiest's 'car' ==
Beside his work in astronomy, Verbiest also experimented with steam. Around 1670 he developed - as a toy for the Emperor's son - a little steam propelled trolley which was, quite possibly, the first steam powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').{{Fact|date=December 2007}}
