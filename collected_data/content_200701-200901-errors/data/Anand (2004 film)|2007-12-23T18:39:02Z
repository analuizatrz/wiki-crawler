== Plot ==

[[Image:Anand1.jpg|thumb|left|Rupa ([[Kamalinee Mukherjee]]) in a sad and contemplative mood]]The film opens with a young Rupa studying for her examinations while her parents and brother get ready to leave for a marriage function. On their way to the function, they meet with a fatal accident owing to drunken driving by Anand's father. The scene shifts to 8 years later where young children are learning [[Carnatic music]] from Rupa ([[Kamalinee Mukherjee]]). Rupa, who's working in an [[advertisement]] agency, is [[engaged]] to get [[marriage|married]] to Rahul ([[Anuj Gurwara]]), [[Managing Director]] of the agency. There enter Anitha ([[Satya Krishnan]]), her neighbor and the kids who form an integral part of the humor [[quotient]] of the movie. The kids, Samatha and Srikanth constantly quarrel with each other. Maamma (English: ''Grandma''), who lives with Anitha, takes care of Samatha and Srikanth. Along with Anitha, Rupa hangs out with a group of friends Radha, Ram, Ali and Patel.

Rupa begins to pool up money for her marriage. One fine day, she gets to see the domineering nature of Rahul's mother and confides into Anitha about her fears about the marriage. She decides to go ahead with the marriage assuming that Rahul's presence will eventually prevail over his mother's nature. Coincidentally, while they are speak at a temple, they notice a person who seems to be [[mentally challenged]] (Anand's father) ogling at them. When Rupa gives him the holy [[prasadam]], he says "Thank you, Rupa". Shocked at how he knew Rupa's name, they quickly exit the temple. 

[[Image:Anand2.jpg|thumb|right|Rupa ([[Kamalinee Mukherjee]]) and Anand ([[Raja (actor)|Raja]]) share a cup of coffee]]Anand is a happy-go-lucky guy who returns from [[United States|America]]. His mother insists on him getting married and on one humorous instance, Anand meets Venkatalakshmi. Unfortunately, Anand doesn't like her attitude towards the poor and this marriage proposal falls apart.
 
All seems well and the day for Rupa's marriage arrives. Incidentally, Anand and his father are also on the list of invitees. Just before the marriage, Rahul's mother creates a fuss about Rupa's marriage attire. Rupa retorts back and this enrages the lady. Rahul suggests Rupa to go according to his mother's wish for the moment and that, he shall take care of her later on. Rupa, in tears, agrees to go ahead and apologize to his mother. On her way, she overhears Rahul convincing his mom that after the marriage, she can exercise control over Rupa. In spite of this, she goes ahead and apologizes. But, Rahul's mother launches a verbal assault on her and embarrasses her. Rupa, unable to bear the humiliation, calls off the marriage. Anand happens to be a silent witness to this. He decides that she's the kind of girl he'd like to marry. Eventually, he moves into a portion of Rupa's house.

[[Image:Anand3.jpg|thumb|left|A visibly happy Rupa ([[Kamalinee Mukherjee]]) and Anand ([[Raja (actor)|Raja]])]]Rupa tries to recover while Rahul keeps coming back once in a while asking her to reconsider. Whereas, Anand settles down at his new home. He befriends Samatha and slowly starts making friends with the rest. On one occasion when Rupa's friends, Ali, Ram and Patel get into a fight with the local goons over a game, Anand manages to save them by calling the cops. This helps his attempts to gain friendship with them. Occasionally, Anand makes several attempts in speaking to Rupa, but she doesn't entertain him. Anitha realizes that Anand likes Rupa and suggests him avenues to befriend Rupa. 

Late one night, upon the death of Rahul's mother, Anand drives Rupa to Rahul’s house. She comforts Rahul while Anand stays back for her. Rupa is thankful to Anand for being around and driving her back but, she realizes that he is jealous of Rahul. She slowly realizes that she began to like Anand. The story progresses and on Rupa's birthday, a drunken Rahul comes to Rupa's house and tries to sexually assault Rupa. Anand saves Rupa and throws Rahul out of the house. Anand gets angry at Rupa for bringing such a situation. He argues that she could have kept a safe distance from Rahul instead of exchanging regular pleasantries. Anand even brings her a birthday present and takes it back leaving behind a sad Rupa. Anand leaves the house and Rupa is dejected.

After a brief hiatus, Rupa’s happiness sees no bounds when sees Anand at a party. She expresses her love for him and the both rejoice. Anand introduces his parents to Rupa. Anand's father, who's negligent driving killed Rupa's family, is introduced saying that he was rendered mentally challenged after that fateful night.

== Production ==
=== Financing ===
After Sekhar Kammula's first venture, ''Dollar Dreams (2000)'', he began meeting producers with his stories. When he initially told them a story, they felt that it was too simple. Then, he began giving them a bound script of ''Anand''. Unfortunately, none came forward to produce it. Upon someone's suggestion, Kammula approached [[National Film Development Corporation of India|National Film Development Corporation]] (NFDC) and they came forward to fund a part of the project.<ref name="NFDC">{{cite web|work=The Hindu: Metro Plus Hyderabad|last=Verma|first=Sujatha|accessdate=2007-10-07|title=Freshly Ground|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/11/10/stories/2004111000380100.htm}}</ref> This set a precedent because it was the first time that NFDC entered into [[commercial]] [[Tollywood|Telugu cinema]].<ref name="Amigos">{{cite web|work=Amigos Creations|title=About the Film|accessdate=2007-10-10|url=http://www.amigoscreations.net/Homepage.swf}}</ref> 

Anish Kuruvilla, who played Anand's cousin in the movie, was the [[executive producer]] for the film and Kammula's following film, [[Godavari (film)|Godavari]] (2006).<ref name="Godavari">{{cite web|last=Jeevi|accessdate=2007-10-10|work=Idlebrain.com|title=Movie review - Godavari|url=http://www.idlebrain.com/movie/archive/mr-godavari.html}}</ref>

=== Casting and locations ===
[[Image:sekhar kammula.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Sekhar Kammula on the sets of Anand]]Kammula preferred actors who suit the roles than writing characters for established actors. Hence, the choice of the cast were non-established actors.<ref name="Happy">{{cite web|work=Hindu.com|last=Narasimhan|first=M.L.|accessdate=2007-10-10|title= Happy as can be|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/08/23/stories/2007082350180400.htm}}</ref> The search process lasted 3 months.<ref name="Interview">{{cite web|work=Idlebrain.com|last=Jeevi|accessdate=2007-10-09|title=Interview with Sekhar Kammula by Jeevi |url=http://www.idlebrain.com/celeb/interview/inter_sekharkammula.html}}</ref> The casting for Raja was simple. Kammula wanted someone without melodrama in acting and it just came as a plus when Raja appreciated Kammula's directorial abilities <ref name="Interview">{{cite web|work=Idlebrain.com|title=Interview with Sekhar Kammula by Jeevi |url=http://www.idlebrain.com/celeb/interview/inter_sekharkammula.html|accessdaymonth=24 November|accessyear=2003}}</ref>. The choice for an actress made Kammula visit [[Mumbai]] and [[Bangalore]], but he could not get the appropriate one. On knowing about [[Kamalinee Mukherjee]], he subjected her to a [[screen test]]. After the test, he selected her as the actress in the lead role.<ref name="Interview">{{cite web|work=Idlebrain.com|title=Interview with Sekhar Kammula by Jeevi |url=http://www.idlebrain.com/celeb/interview/inter_sekharkammula.html|accessdaymonth=24 November|accessyear=2003}}</ref> The choice of location was first thought as [[Ramoji Film City]] and Nanakramguda in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]]. So, these thoughts were quashed because the need was for a suitably big house and an [[outhouse]] situated adjacent to it. Since Kammula stayed in ''Padmarao Nagar'', a prominent [[locality]] in Hyderabad, a location there made it all the more accessible for him.<ref name="Interview">{{cite web|work=Idlebrain.com|title=Interview with Sekhar Kammula by Jeevi |url=http://www.idlebrain.com/celeb/interview/inter_sekharkammula.html|accessdaymonth=24 November|accessyear=2003}}</ref>

=== Miscellaneous ===

Kammula's primary inspiration came from the [[India]]n [[middle class]]. He was of the thought that this section of people were wrongly represented in films. He wanted to represent them appropriately and this was achieved with ''Anand''.<ref name="TotaltollywoodIntw">{{cite web|work=Totaltollywood.com|last=Phani|accessdate=2007-10-11|title=An exclusive interview with Sekhar Kammula |url=http://www.totaltollywood.com/interviews/interviews.php?category=6&id=sekhark3}}</ref>

Kammula sat with [[Veturi]] for writing [[song]]s for the film. Kammula said that he could see thousands of expressions expressed as a couple of words in lyrics. Eventually, they ended up with six beautiful [[song]]s penned by Veturi. For ''Anand'', Veturi took a month to come up with the [[lyric]]s as against his usual penchant of coming up with lyrics spontaneously.<ref name="Interview">{{cite web|work=Idlebrain.com|title=Interview with Sekhar Kammula by Jeevi |url=http://www.idlebrain.com/celeb/interview/inter_sekharkammula.html|accessdaymonth=24 November|accessyear=2003}}</ref>

Being a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] <ref name="Kamalinee">{{cite web|work=Idlebrain.com|last=Jeevi|accessdate=2007-10-10|title=Interview with Kamalinee Mukherjee by Jeevi |url=http://www.idlebrain.com/celeb/interview/interview-kamalineemukherjee.html}}</ref>, there was a need for someone to [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] 
[[Kamalinee Mukherjee]]'s voice for the film.<ref name="Kamalineenontelugu">{{cite web|work=Idlebrain.com|accessdate=2007-10-10|title=Anand - Press Meet |url=http://www.idlebrain.com/news/2000march20/anand-pressmeet.html}}</ref> This was provided by a well-known [[singer]] and [[Host (event)|television host]], [[Sunitha (Singer)|Sunitha]]. The voice of Sunitha blended so well with the screen presence of Kamalinee that she went on to win an award for it.<ref name="Nandi2004">{{cite web|work=Idlebrain.com|accessdate=2007-10-10|title=Nandi Awards 2004 Response|url=http://www.idlebrain.com/news/2000march20/nandiawards2004response.html}}</ref>

With most of the cast not well-versed in speaking ''[[Telugu language|Telugu]]'', Kammula faced challenges in their [[dialogue]] delivery. It just happened that most of the cast couldn't speak ''Telugu''. The crew had to face a slight loss of the performance owing to this fact. To overcome this handicap, the dialogues were altered slightly to improve the actors' diction.<ref name="TotaltollywoodIntw">{{cite web|work=Totaltollywood.com|title=An exclusive interview with Sekhar Kammula |url=http://www.totaltollywood.com/interviews/interviews.php?category=6&id=sekhark3}}</ref>

== Release ==
=== Critical acclaim and reviews ===
''Anand'' had a relatively low-profile release unlike the huge banner releases of the [[Telugu language|Telugu]] film industry. Made with a modest budget of Rs. 15 million <ref name="IMDB">{{cite web|accessdate=2007-10-11|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0857300/business|title=Box office/business for Anand (2004)|work=IMDB}}</ref>, ''Anand'' was a refreshing movie of its time. Kammula wasn't sure of the outcome of the film and said "''I knew that it would either be a huge hit or a huge flop''".<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2007-10-11|url=http://www.nriinternet.com/Section1/12Movies%20and%20Music/2004/Telgu_Films/Anand_and_Dollar/index.htm| title=Don't call me an NRI: Sekhar Kammula|work=IANS}}</ref> Rated as "U" (Universal: Suitable for all ages) by the [[Central Board of Film Certification]] of [[India]] <ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2007-10-11|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0857300|title=Anand (2004)|work=IMDB}}</ref>, it evoked a decent response from the critics.

Both these films went on to become box-office successes.
