{{nihongo|'''''Chrono Trigger'''''|クロノ・トリガー|Kurono Torigā}} is a [[console role-playing game]] [[video game developer|developed]] and [[video game publisher|published]] by [[Square Co.|Square]] (now [[Square Enix]]) for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1995. The game's story follows a group of young adventurers who travel through time to prevent a global catastrophe. Square re-released a ported version by [[TOSE]] in Japan for [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation]] in 1999, later repackaged with a ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'' port as ''[[Final Fantasy Chronicles]]'' in 2001. A slightly enhanced ''Chrono Trigger'' was  released for the [[Nintendo DS]] on November 25, 2008<ref>http://na.square-enix.com/ctds/</ref> in North America and Japan, and will come to Europe in early 2009. It has never been released in [[PAL region|PAL]] territories on the SNES or the PlayStation.

The development team of ''Chrono Trigger'' was headed by three designers that Square dubbed the "Dream Team", consisting of [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], creator of the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series, and [[Yuuji Horii]] and [[Akira Toriyama]]—two freelance designers known for their work on [[Enix]]'s ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series. The game was produced by [[Kazuhiko Aoki]].<ref name="Dream-team-name">{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co. | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System  | quote='''Keizo Kokubo:''' Well then, open the Gates to the Dream Team! ... / '''Developer's Ending:''' Cheers!

''Chrono Trigger'' was well-received by reviewers and commercially successful. ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' magazine described certain aspects of ''Chrono Trigger'' as revolutionary, including its multiple endings, plot-related [[Quest (gaming)#Side-quest|sidequests]] focusing on character development, unique battle system, and detailed graphics.<ref name="npreview1">{{Cite journal |month=July | year=1995 |volume=74 |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |title=Epic Center: Chrono Trigger |pages=p.&nbsp;52}}</ref> The game has shipped more than 2.36 million copies in Japan and 290,000 worldwide as of March 31, 2003.<ref name="square-sales"/>

==Gameplay==
''Chrono Trigger'' features standard [[console role-playing game]] (RPG) gameplay with several innovations. The player controls the protagonist and his companions in the game's [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] [[fictional universe|fictional world]], consisting of various forests, cities, and dungeons. Navigation occurs via an [[overworld]] map, depicting the landscape from a scaled down overhead view. Areas such as forests, cities, and similar places are depicted as more realistic scaled down maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s gameplay deviates from that of traditional RPGs in that, rather than appearing in [[random encounter]]s, many enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party. Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the map rather than on a separate battle screen.<ref name="npreview2">{{Cite journal |month=July | year=1995 |volume=74 |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |title=Epic Center: Chrono Trigger |pages=p.&nbsp;53}}</ref> This concept had previously been featured in such titles as ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy Adventure]]'', but was uncommon at the time for RPGs outside the [[Action role-playing game|action RPG]] genre.
[[Image:ChronoTriggerInside.PNG|thumb|256px|left|Example of a basic battle]]
Players and enemies may use physical or magical attacks to wound targets during battle, and players may use items to heal or protect themselves.  Each character and enemy has a certain number of [[hit point]]s, and successful attacks reduce that character's hit points, while hit points can be restored with potions and spells.  When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints; if all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved chapter, except in specific storyline-related battles that allow or force the player to lose.  Between battles, the player can equip his/her characters with weapons, armor, helmets, and accessories that provide special effects (such as increased attack power or defense against magic), and various consumable items can be used both in and out of battles.  Items and equipment can be purchased in shops or found on field maps, often in [[Treasure chest (video games)|treasure chests]].  By exploring new areas and fighting enemies, players progress through ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s story.

''Chrono Trigger'' uses an [[Active Time Battle]] system—a staple of Square's ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' game series designed by [[Hiroyuki Itō]] for ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''—named "Active Time Battle 2.0".<ref name="Battle 2.0">{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co. | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System  | quote='''Menu screen:''' Active Time Battle 2.0}}</ref> Each character can take action in battle once a personal timer dependent on the character's speed [[Attribute (role-playing games)|statistic]] counts to zero. Magic and special physical techniques are handled through a system called "Techs". Techs deplete a character's [[magic point]]s (a numerical meter like hit points), and often have special [[area of effect|areas of effect]]; some spells damage huddled monsters, while others can harm enemies spread in a line. Enemies often change positions during battle, creating opportunities for tactical Tech use. A unique feature of ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Tech system is that numerous cooperative techniques exist.<ref name="npreview2" /> Each character receives eight personal Techs which can be used in conjunction with others' to create Double and Triple Techs for greater effect. For instance, Crono's sword-spinning ''Cyclone'' Tech can be combined with Lucca's ''Flame Toss'' to create ''Fire Whirl''. When characters with compatible Techs have enough magic points available to perform their techniques, the game automatically displays the combo as an option.

''Chrono Trigger'' features several other unique gameplay traits, including [[time travel]]. Players have access to seven eras of the game world's history, and past actions affect future events. Throughout history, players find new allies, complete side quests, and search for keynote villains. Time travel is accomplished via portals and pillars of light called "time gates", as well as a [[Time travel|time machine]] named ''[[Epoch (Chrono Trigger)|Epoch]]''. The game contains thirteen unique endings; the ending the player receives depends on when and how he or she reaches and completes the game's final battle.<ref name="nppreview">{{Cite journal| volume=73 |month=June | year=1995 |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |title=Chrono Trigger: A New Standard for RPGs | pages=p.&nbsp;37}}</ref> The re-release of ''Chrono Trigger'' for the DS features a new ending that can be accessed from the End of Time upon completion of the final extra dungeon. The ending is reported to contain a new optional final boss. ''Chrono Trigger'' also introduces a [[New Game Plus|New Game+]] option—after completing the game, the player may begin a new game with the same character [[Experience point|levels]], [[Skill (role-playing games)|techniques]], and equipment (but not money) that he or she ended the previous game with. Certain items central to the storyline are removed and must be found again, such as the sword Masamune. Square has since employed the New Game+ concept in later titles, including ''[[Vagrant Story]],'' ''[[Chrono Cross]]'', ''[[Parasite Eve series|Parasite Eve]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]''.

==Plot==
===Setting===
''Chrono Trigger'' takes place on a fictional [[parallel world|alternate timeline]] of earth as the characters frequently [[time travel|travel through time]] to obtain allies, gather equipment, or learn information for their quest.  The time periods the characters travel to range from 65,000,000 B.C. at the dawn of civilization to 2300 A.D. in a post-apocalyptic world.  The party also gains access to the End of Time (year&nbsp;<math>\infty</math>), which serves as a hub to travel back to other time periods.  Eventually, the party is given the ''Epoch'', a vehicle that is capable of time travel between any period without traveling to the End of Time first.

===Characters===
{{main|Characters of Chrono Trigger}}
[[Image:Chrono Trigger Magus battle artwork.PNG|thumb|256px|Promotional art illustrating Crono, Lucca, and Frog battling Magus]]
''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s seven playable characters come from different eras in the game world's history. ''Chrono Trigger'' begins in 1000 A.D. with [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Crono|Crono]], [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Marle|Marle]], and [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Lucca|Lucca]]. Crono is the silent protagonist, characterized as a fearless young man with an interest in the art of wielding [[katana]]s. Marle,  lives in the castle, which is surrounded by lush forests. A protected girl, daring but reckless,  who on one occasion, slips out of the castle and travels around the fair belying her royal lineage. Lucca is a friend of Crono and a mechanical genius who wields a gun; her home is filled with laboratory equipment and machinery.

From the era of A.D. 2300 comes [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Robo|Robo]], originally designed as "R-66Y", a robot with a helpful and near-human personality created to assist humans. It is outfitted with a powerful arm. Found dormant in the future, Robo is repaired by Lucca and joins the group in an act of gratitude.<ref name="characters">{{cite book | year=2001 | title=Final Fantasy Chronicles instruction manual | pages=pp.&nbsp;32–33 | publisher=Square Enix  | id=SLUS-01363}}</ref>The fiercely confident [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Ayla|Ayla]] dwells in 65,000,000 B.C. Unmatched in raw strength, Ayla is the chief of Ioka Village, and leads her people in war against a species of humanoid [[reptile]]s known as Reptites.

The last two characters — [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Frog|Frog]], and the character [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Magus|Magus]] — originate in A.D. 600. Frog is a former [[squire]] once named Glenn; Magus turned Glenn into an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] frog and also slew his friend Cyrus. Chivalrous but mired in regret, Frog dedicates his life to protecting Leene, the queen of Guardia, and avenging Cyrus. Meanwhile, Guardia in A.D. 600. is in a state of war against the Mystics (known as Fiends in the US DS port), a race of demons and intelligent animals. Under the leadership of Magus, a powerful [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] they wage war against humanity. While Magus appears to be a powerful magician, his seclusiveness contains a long-lost past, a time when he used to be known as Janus, the young prince of the Kingdom of Zeal, which was destroyed by Lavos in 12,000 B.C. The incident sent him forward through time, and as he ages, he plots revenge against Lavos and broods over the fate of his sister, [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Schala|Schala]].<ref name="characters" /> Lavos, who awakens and ravages the world in A.D. 1999, is an extraterrestrial parasitic creature that harvests DNA and the Earth's energy for its own growth.

===Story===
In 1000 A.D., Crono and Marle watch Lucca and her father demonstrate her new teleportation device at the Millennial Fair. When Marle volunteers, her pendant interferes with the device and creates a time portal that she is drawn into.  Crono and Lucca separately recreate the portal and find themselves in 600 A.D., and learn that Marle's presence has created a [[grandfather paradox]] by preventing the recovery of Marle's kidnapped ancestor.  Crono and Lucca, with the help of Frog, restore history to normal by recovering the kidnapped girl. After returning to the present, Crono is arrested on charges of kidnapping the princess and sentenced to death by the king's evil advisor. Lucca and Marle help Crono to flee, haphazardly using another time portal to escape their pursuers. Upon arriving in the year 2300 A.D., they eventually learn that an advanced civilization has been wiped out by a giant creature known as Lavos that appeared in 1999 A.D. The three vow to find a way to prevent the destruction of their world.

After meeting and repairing Robo, Crono and his friends begin to travel through time, assisted by Gaspar, an old sage at the End of Time, to collect more allies, items, and information to face Lavos. Their party expands to include Ayla and Frog.  They come to learn that Lavos was an alien being that impacted the planet millions of years in the past, and began to absorb [[DNA]] and energy from every creature on it, eventually having enough power to arise and raze the planet's surface in 1999 A.D. However, Lavos' presence had been discovered by Queen Zeal of the Mystics in 12,000 B.C. The Queen believed she could summon Lavos and harness its power to achieve immortality, and caused the Queen's adopted son, Janus, and her advisers, [[Biblical Magi|Gaspar, Melchior and Balthasar]], to be spread throughout time, preventing them from collaborating and stopping Lavos's return.

Janus vowed to learn how to summon the beast himself so that he could destroy it. He took the alias of [[Magi|Magus]], and gained a cult of followers, believing that he sought the summoning of Lavos in order to take over the planet himself.  The party initially mistakes Magus as the cause of Lavos but come to learn of his troubled past. They travel to 12,000 B.C., and storm the Ocean Palace to prevent the Queen from summoning the being in the first place.  However, they are ill-prepared for their assault and as Lavos attempts to kill them all, Crono sacrifices himself to protect everyone. The adult Magus fails to defeat Lavos, and its power causes a [[tsunami]] to destroy Zeal and cover most of the world in water. The Ocean Palace then rises into the air, becoming the Black Omen, which, if not destroyed, exists in all future time periods. The group turns to Gaspar for help, and he gives them a device, called a "Chrono Trigger" that is able to replace Crono just before the moment of death with a [[doppleganger|Dopple Doll]].  The group collects the necessary components for the process, and travel to 12,000 B.C. again, saving Crono and leaving the doll to absorb the attack. After gaining enough power, Crono and the others assault Lavos and are able to defeat it, thus saving the future of their world.

If Magus joined the party, he departs to search for his missing sister, Schala. Crono's mother accidentally enters the time gate at the fair before it closes, prompting Crono, Marle, and Lucca to set out in the Epoch to find her while fireworks light up the night sky.<ref name="crono'smom">'''Mom:''' Look, Crono! Your cat's running away because you haven't been feeding it! Hey, come back here! / '''Marle:''' Oh, great! Crono, that Gate will never open again! / '''Lucca:''' Well it looks like we have no choice but to go after them! / '''Marle:''' Go after them?! But the Gate's... Lucca, don't turn off your brain, yet! / '''Lucca:''' I forgot! We have a Time Machine! {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System  }}</ref> Alternatively, if the party used the Epoch to break Lavos's outer shell, Marle will help her father hang Nadia's bell at the festival and accidentally get carried away by several balloons. Crono jumps on to help her, but cannot bring them down to earth. Hanging on in each others arms, the pair travel through the cloudy, moonlit sky.

==Development history==
''Chrono Trigger'' was produced by [[Kazuhiko Aoki]] while director credits were attributed to [[Akihiko Matsui]], [[Yoshinori Kitase]] and [[Takashi Tokita]]. Supervisors included [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], producer and creator of the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series, and [[Yuuji Horii]], director and creator of the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series. The game was originally developed without involvement from Tokita and Kitase, the latter being busy directing ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''.

A fan of [[time travel in fiction|time travel]] fiction (such as the TV series ''[[Time Tunnel]]''), Horii fostered a theme of time travel in his general outline of ''Chrono Trigger'' with input from [[Akira Toriyama]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Yuji Horii interview | url=http://www.playmagazine.com/index.php?fuseaction=SiteMain.showGamePage&Game_ID=169 | author=Play staff |publisher=''[[Play (US magazine)|Play]]'' online | accessmonthday=February 16 | accessyear=2007}}</ref><ref name="ultimania" /> [[Masato Kato]] subsequently edited and completed the outline by writing the majority of the game's story, including all the events of the 12,000 B.C. era.<ref name="procyon" /> Kato devised the system of multiple endings because he could not branch the story out to different paths.<ref name="weeklyfamitsu" /> [[Yoshinori Kitase]] and [[Takashi Tokita]] then wrote various [[subplot]]s.<ref name="procyon" /> The characters of ''Chrono Trigger'' were designed by Akira Toriyama, creator of the [[manga]] ''[[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]]'' and a longtime contributor to the ''Dragon Quest'' series. Other notable designers include [[Tetsuya Takahashi]], the graphic director, and [[Yasuyuki Honne]], [[Tetsuya Nomura]], and [[Yusuke Naora]], who worked as field graphic artists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Chrono_Trigger_Credits.html |title=Chrono Trigger Credits |accessdate=2007-02-16 |author=Chrono Compendium staff |publisher=Chrono Compendium}}</ref>

''Chrono Trigger'' used a 32-[[megabit]] [[cartridge (electronics)|cartridge]] with battery-backed [[Random access memory|RAM]] for [[saved game]]s, lacking special on-cartridge coprocessors.

===PlayStation release===

Square released an enhanced [[porting|port]] of ''Chrono Trigger'' developed by [[TOSE]] in Japan for the Sony PlayStation in 1999. Square timed its release before that of ''[[Chrono Cross]]'', the 1999 sequel to ''Chrono Trigger'', to give new players familiarity with the story of its predecessor.<ref name="ultimania" /> This version included [[anime]] cut scenes created by original character designer Akira Toriyama's [[Bird Studio]] and animated by [[Toei Animation]], as well as several bonus features, accessible after achieving various endings in the game. Scenarist Masato Kato attended planning meetings at Bird Studio to discuss how the ending cut scenes would illustrate subtle ties to ''[[Chrono Cross]]''.<ref name="ultimania" /> The port was later released in North America in 2001—along with a [[remaster]]ed version of ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''—under the package title ''[[Final Fantasy Chronicles]]''. Reviewers criticized ''Chronicles'' for lengthy load times and an absence of new in-game features.<ref name="loadtime" /><ref>{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy Chronicles for PlayStation Review | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/finalfantasychronicles/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary%3Bread-review&page=2 | publisher=GameSpot | |author= Shoemaker, Brad |accessdate=December 27 | accessyear=2008 | date= 2001-06-06}}</ref>

''Chrono Trigger'' was scored by [[Yasunori Mitsuda]] and veteran ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], with one track composed by both Uematsu and [[Noriko Matsueda]]. A sound programmer at the time, Mitsuda was unhappy with his pay and threatened to leave Square if he could not compose music.<ref name="powerup" /> Hironobu Sakaguchi suggested he score ''Chrono Trigger'', remarking, "maybe your salary will go up."<ref name="mitsuda2008" /> Mitsuda reflected, "I wanted to create music that wouldn't fit into any established genre...music of an imaginary world. The game's director, Masato Kato, was my close friend, and so I'd always talk with him about the setting and the scene before going into writing."<ref name="powerup" /> Mitsuda slept in his studio several nights, and attributed certain songs—such as ''To Far Away Times''—to inspiring dreams.<ref name="mitsuda2008" /> He also suffered a hard drive crash that lost around forty in-progress tracks.<ref name="famitsujuly2008">{{cite journal| year=2008 | journal=[[Famitsu]] | title=Chrono Trigger DS | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/July_2008_Weekly_Famitsu_Interview_with_Yasunori_Mitsuda.html   | pages=pp.&nbsp;67–70 | language=Japanese}}</ref> After Mitsuda contracted stomach ulcers, Uematsu joined the project to compose ten songs and finish the score.<ref name="powerup">{{Cite book | year=2004 | first=Chris |last=Kohler |authorlink=Chris Kohler | title=[[Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life]] | publisher=DK Publishing  | isbn=0-7440-0424-1}}</ref> Mitsuda returned to watch the ending with the staff before the game's release, crying upon seeing the finished scene.<ref name="famitsujuly2008" /> Mitsuda considers ''Chrono Trigger'' a landmark title which helped mature his talent.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

At the time of the game's release, the number of tracks and sound effects was unprecedented—the soundtrack spanned three discs in its 1995 commercial pressing.<ref name="npreview1" /> Square also released a one-disc [[acid jazz]] arrangement called "''[[The Brink of Time]]''" by [[Guido (jazz band)|Guido]] that year. In 1999, Square produced another one-disc soundtrack to complement the PlayStation release of ''Trigger'', featuring [[orchestra]]l tracks used in [[cut scene]]s. Yasunori Mitsuda also composed four new pieces for the game's bonus features which weren't included on the soundtrack. Recently, Mitsuda arranged versions of music from the ''Chrono'' series for [[Play!

''Chrono Trigger'' inspired several [[sequel]]s and expansion packs or add-ons; the first were three titles released for the [[Satellaview]] in 1995. They included ''Chrono Trigger: Jet Bike Special'', a [[racing game]] based on a [[minigame]] from the original; ''Chrono Trigger: Character Library'', featuring profiles on characters and monsters from the game; and ''Chrono Trigger: Music Library'', a collection of music from the game's soundtrack. The contents of ''Character Library'' and ''Music Library'' were later included as extras in the PlayStation rerelease of ''Chrono Trigger''.
