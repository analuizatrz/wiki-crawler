Kalimpong is known for its educational institutions that attract students from [[North-East India|North East India]], West Bengal, Bhutan, Nepal, and Bangladesh.<ref name="Education and prospects for employment">{{cite web|url=http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/stateplan/sdr_pdf/shdr_sikkim01.pdf|format=PDF|title=Education and prospects for employment|publisher=Government of Sikkim|pages=33|accessdate=2008-12-21}}</ref> In recent times, Kalimpong has become an important tourist destination owing to its temperate climate and proximity to popular tourist locations in the region. Kalimpong is famous for its flower market, especially the wide array of [[Orchidaceae|orchids]]. Flower nurseries involved in exporting Himalayan grown flower bulbs, tubers and rhizomes contribute to the economy of Kalimpong.<ref name="General Information" /> The Buddhist monastery [[Zang Dhok Palri Phodang]] holds a number of rare [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] scriptures.<ref name="Special: Kalimpong, West Bengal in Rediff">{{cite web|url=http://specials.rediff.com/getahead/2008/feb/08sld3.htm|title=Special: Kalimpong, West Bengal|publisher=[[Rediff]]|accessdate=2008-12-08}}</ref>

==Name origin==
The precise [[etymology]] of the name ''Kalimpong'' remains unclear. The most widely accepted origin of the name ''Kalimpong'' is "Assembly (or Stockade) of the King's Ministers" in [[Tibetan language|Tibetan]], derived from ''kalon'' ("King's ministers") and ''pong'' ("[[stockade]]"). Another possible origin to the name comes from the translation "ridges where we play" from [[Lepcha language|Lepcha]], derived from the region's traditional tribal gathering for summer sporting events. People from the hills also call the area ''Kalibong'' ("the black spurs").<ref name="Kalimpong Etymology">{{cite web|url=http://www.wb.nic.in/westbg/kalimpong2.html|title=Kalimpong Etymology|publisher=Government of West Bengal|accessdate=2008-12-22}}</ref>

According to K.P. Tamsang, author of ''The Untold and Unknown Reality about the Lepchas'', the term Kalimpong is deduced from the name ''Kalenpung'', which in Lepcha means "Hillock of Assemblage";<ref name=kalidarjhist>{{cite web

==History==
[[Image:morganhouse.jpg|thumb|Morgan House, is a classic example of colonial architecture in Kalimpong.]]
Until the mid-19th century, the area around Kalimpong was ruled in succession by the [[Sikkim]]ese and [[Bhutan]]ese kingdoms.<ref name="sikkimkalimpong">{{cite book|last=Gurung|first=Chanda|coauthors=Gurung, Nawraj|title=Social and Gender Analysis in Natural Resource Management|editor=Ronnie Vernooy|publisher=International Development Research Centre (Canada), NetLibrary, Inc|year=2006|pages=39–43|chapter=The Social and Gendered Nature of Ginger Production and Commercialization|isbn=155250218X}}</ref><ref name=kalidarjhist/> Under Sikkimese rule, the area was known as ''Dalingkot''.<ref name="Next weekend you can be at ...

Kalimpong"/> Kalimpong is believed to have once been the forward position of the Bhutanese in the 18th century, overlooking the Teesta Valley. The area was sparsely populated by the indigenous [[Lepcha people|Lepcha]] community and migrant [[Bhutia]] and [[Limbu people|Limbu]] tribes. Later in 1780, the [[Gorkha]]s invaded and conquered Kalimpong.<ref name="Next weekend you can be at ... Kalimpong" /> After the [[Anglo-Bhutan War]] in 1864, the [[Treaty of Sinchula]] (1865) was signed in which Bhutanese held territory east of the [[Teesta River]] was ceded to the [[British East India Company]].<ref name=kalidarjhist/> At that time, Kalimpong was a hamlet, with only two or three families known to reside there.<ref name=tribunekalim>{{cite web

}}</ref> The first recorded mention of the town was a fleeting reference made that year by [[Ashley Eden]], a government official with the Bengal Civil Service.

After the war, the region was made into a subdivision of the [[Western Duars]] district, and the following year it was merged with the district of Darjeeling.<ref name=kalidarjhist/> The temperate climate prompted the British to develop the town as an alternative hill station to [[Darjeeling]], to escape the scorching summer heat in the [[Indo-Gangetic plain|plains]]. Kalimpong's proximity to the [[Nathula]] and [[Jelepla]] passes, offshoots of the ancient [[Silk Road]], was an added advantage and it soon became an important trading outpost in the trade of [[fur]]s, [[wool]]s and food grains between India and Tibet.<ref name="khawaslhasa">{{cite news|title=The Forgotten Way: Recalling the road to Lhasa from Kalimpong|last=Khawas|first=Vimal|date=[[31 December]] 2004|work=[[The Statesman]]|publisher=The Statesman Ltd}}</ref> The increase in population attracted large numbers of migrants from Nepal, leading to a sudden population increase and economic prosperity.

The arrival of Scottish [[Missionary|missionaries]] saw the construction of schools and welfare centres for the British.<ref name=tribunekalim/> Rev. W. Macfarlane in the early 1870s established the first schools in the area.<ref name=tribunekalim/> The Scottish University Mission Institution was opened in 1886, followed by the Kalimpong Girls High School. In 1900, Reverend J.A. Graham founded the [[Dr. Graham's Homes]] for destitute [[Anglo-Indian]] students.<ref name=tribunekalim/> By 1907, most schools in Kalimpong also started offering education to Indian students. By 1911, the population had swelled to 7,880.

Following [[Indian independence movement|India's independence]] in 1947, Kalimpong became part of the state of West Bengal, after Bengal was partitioned between India and [[Pakistan]]. With [[People's Republic of China|China's]] annexation of Tibet in 1959, many Buddhist monks fled [[Tibet]] and established monasteries in Kalimpong. These monks also brought many rare Buddhist scriptures with them. In 1962, the permanent closure of the Jelepla Pass after the [[Sino-Indian War]] led to a slowdown in Kalimpong's economy, which relied heavily in trade between Tibet and India. In 1976, the visiting [[Dalai Lama]] consecrated the [[Zang Dhok Palri Phodang]] monastery, which houses many of the scriptures.

[[Image:Kalimpongkanchenjanga.jpg|thumb|Most large houses in Kalimpong were built during the British era. In the background is Mount Kanchenjunga.]]
Between 1986 and 1988, the demand for a separate state of [[Gorkhaland]] and [[Kamtapur]] based on ethnic lines grew strong. Riots between the [[Gorkha National Liberation Front]] (GNLF) and the West Bengal government reached a standoff after a forty-day strike. The town was virtually under a siege, leading the state government to call in the Indian army to maintain law and order. This led to the formation of the [[Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council]], a body that was given semi-autonomous powers to govern Darjeeling district. Though Kalimpong is now peaceful, the issue of a separate state still lingers. In July 2004, the generally tranquil town was catapulted into national and international headlines after [[Maninder Pal Singh Kohli]], a murderer wanted by [[Scotland Yard]], was traced and found to be residing in Kalimpong.<ref>''[http://www.suntimes.co.za/2004/07/25/news/durban/ndbn13.asp Wife duped by murder fugitive]'', Peter Foster, [http://www.suntimes.co.za Sunday Times (South Africa)], Sunday, [[2004-07-25]].</ref>

==Geography==
[[Image:Deolo.jpg|thumb|A view from the Deolo Resort, atop Deolo Hill, Kalimpong's highest point.]]
The town centre is located on a [[ridge]] connecting two hills, [[Deolo Hill]] and [[Durpin Hill]],<ref name=tribunekalim/> at an elevation of {{m to ft|1247|abbr=on}}. Deolo, the highest point in Kalimpong, has an altitude of {{m to ft|1704|abbr=on}} and Durpin Hill is at an elevation of {{m to ft|1372|abbr=on}}. The [[River Teesta]] flows in the valley below and separates Kalimpong from the state of Sikkim. The soil in the Kalimpong area is typically reddish in color. Occasional dark soils are found due to extensive existence of [[phyllite]] and [[schists]].<ref name="Identification and Mapping of Hazard Prone areas regarding landslide in the Darjeeling Hill areas">{{cite web|url=http://darjeeling.gov.in/geography.html|title=Identification and Mapping of Hazard Prone areas regarding landslide in the Darjeeling Hill areas|first=Mamata Desai|coauthors=Netaji Institute for Asian Studies,1, Woodburn Park, Kolkata|work=Department of Ecology & Environment|publisher=Government of Darjeeling|accessdate=2008-12-20}}</ref> The [[Siwalik Hills|Shiwalik Hills]], like most of the Himalayan foothills, have steep slopes and soft, loose topsoil, leading to frequent [[landslide]]s in the [[monsoon]] season.<ref name="Identification and Mapping of Hazard Prone areas regarding landslide in the Darjeeling Hill areas" /> The hills are nestled within higher peaks and the snow-clad Himalayan ranges tower over the town in the distance. Mount [[Kanchenjunga]] at {{m to ft|8591|abbr=on}} the world's third tallest peak, is clearly visible from Kalimpong.
[[Image:Kalimpong 02.jpg|thumb|View of the Himalaya range.]]
Kalimpong has five distinct seasons: spring, summer, autumn, winter and the [[monsoon]]s. Summers are mild, with the highs usually never crossing {{convert|30|C|F}}, and last between May and June. Summers are followed by the monsoon rains which lash the town between June and September. The monsoons are severe, often causing landslides which sequester the town from the rest of India. Winter lasts from December to February, with the maximum temperature being around {{convert|15|C|F}}. During the monsoon and winter seasons, Kalimpong is often enveloped by [[fog]]. The annual temperature ranges from a high of {{convert|30|C|F}} to a low of {{convert|-4|C|F}}.

Many locales in Kalimpong are named based on its distance in miles from [[Teesta Bazaar]], a town which lies on the Teesta River in the valley below. For example, the locale ''13th mile'' would be situated at a distance of {{Mi to km|13}} from Teesta Bazaar.

==Economy==
[[Image:Kalimpong 52.jpg|thumb|Oranges grown in the hillsides are exported to many parts of India.]]

The most significant contributor to the Kalimpong economy is tourism.<ref name="kuenseledu">{{cite news|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=11317|title=Kalimpong – As popular an educational destination as ever|last=Norbu|first=Passang|date=17 October 2008|work=Kuensel Online|publisher=Kuensel Corporation|accessdate=2008-12-09}}</ref> The summer and spring seasons are the most popular with tourists, keeping many of Kalimpong's residents employed directly and indirectly. Kalimpong was known as major [[ginger]] growing area of India, but after [[Sikkim]] was [[History of Sikkim|annexed by India in 1975]], Sikkim markets were also opened. Now, Kalimpong and Sikkim together contribute 15 percent of ginger produced.<ref name="Social and Gender Analysis in Natural Resource Management: Learning Studies and Lessons from Asia">{{cite book|first=Ronnie Vernooy of International Development Research Centre (Canada), NetLibrary, Inc|title=Social and Gender Analysis in Natural Resource Management: Learning Studies and Lessons from Asia|publisher=IDRC|year=2006|pages=64|isbn=155250218X|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5wFC3LnOfSUC}}</ref>

Many establishments cater to the Indian army base near the town, providing it with essential supplies. Small contributions to the economy come by the way of the sale of traditional arts and crafts of [[Sikkim]] and [[Tibet]]. Government efforts related to [[sericulture]], [[seismology]], [[fisheries]] etc. provide a steady source of employment to many of its residents. Kalimpong is well known for its flower export industry &ndash; especially for its wide array of indigenous [[Orchidaceae|orchids]] and [[gladioli]].<ref>[http://www.hillstationsinindia.com/east-india-hill-stations/kalimponq.html Kalimpong], [http://www.hillstationsinindia.com Hill stations in India]</ref> The [[Indian government]]'s proposal to reopen the Nathula and Jelepla passes in April 2006 will significantly boost the economy, as Kalimpong lies on historic trade routes.<ref>[http://www.flonnet.com/fl2014/stories/20030718005201800.htm Routes of promise], [http://www.flonnet.com Frontline magazine], Volume 20, Issue 14; 5–18 July July 2004.</ref>

Another important contributor to the town's economy is education sector.<ref name="kuenseledu"/> The schools of Kalimpong besides imparting education to the locals also cater to a significant number of students from the plains, the neighbouring state of Sikkim and also foreign countries such as Bhutan,<ref name="kuenseledu"/> Bangladesh, Nepal and Thailand. Besides providing livelihood to those directly involved with education, such as teachers, paying guest-keepers and other school staff, they also provide a good source of income to book sellers, hawkers, canteen wallahs, restaurant owners, garment sellers and drivers.<ref name="kuenseledu"/> In fact during the winters when schools shut for vacations, the economy of the town goes into a low scale hibernation mode.<ref name="kuenseledu"/>

==Transport==
[[Image:teestavalley.jpg|thumb|National Highway 31A winds along the banks of the river Teesta near Kalimpong.]]
Most people live fairly close to the market and so they walk between their homes and the market. Those staying far from the town centre own vehicles or rely on local share-taxis to travel to their destinations. Taxis for exclusive use around the city are also available. [[Four wheel drive]]s are the most popular means of transport, as they can easily navigate the steep slopes in the region.

The nearest [[airport]] is [[Bagdogra Airport]] near [[Siliguri]] located at a distance of 80&nbsp;km (50&nbsp;mi), while the nearest railhead connecting the rest of India is [[New Jalpaiguri]], located on the outskirts of Siliguri.<ref name="General Information" /> Kalimpong is located off the National Highway 31A, which links [[Sevok]] to Gangtok.
