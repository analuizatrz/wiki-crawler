'''The University of Texas at Austin''' (often referred to as '''The University of Texas''', '''UT Austin''', '''UT''', or '''Texas''') is a doctoral/research university located in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]]. It is the [[flagship#University campuses|flagship]]<ref name="flagship1">{{cite news | url=http://www.utexas.edu/opa/news/2005/07/mcdonald21.html | title=Texas flagship universities celebrate milestone of Giant Magellan Telescope partnership | publisher=University of Texas | date=2005-07-21 | accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref><ref name="flagship2">{{cite news | url=http://www.utexas.edu/supportut/campaign/ | title=A Capital Achievement | publisher=University of Texas | accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref><ref name="flagship3">{{cite news | url=http://www2.egr.uh.edu/news/Make_UH_next_flagship.html | title=Logical to make UH our next flagship university | author=Cunningham, William | publisher=University of Houston | date=2000-06-01 | accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref><ref name="flagship4">{{cite web | url=http://www.nndb.com/edu/364/000082118/ | title=University of Texas | work=NNDB | accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref><ref name="flagship5">{{cite news | url=http://washingtontimes.com/culture/20051002-103300-6882r.htm | title=Flagship university of Texas seeks to boost diversity | author=Austin, Liz | date=2005-10-03 | accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref> institution of [[University of Texas System|The University of Texas System]]. The main campus is located less than a mile from the [[Texas State Capitol]] in Austin. According to ''The Public Ivies: America's Flagship Public Universities'' (2001) by Howard and Matthew Greene, The University of Texas at Austin is one of America's "[[Public Ivy]]" institutions of higher education, defined by the authors as a public institution that "provides an Ivy League collegiate experience at a public school price." Founded in 1883, the university has had [[List of largest United States universities by enrollment|the fifth largest]] single-campus enrollment in the nation as of fall 2006 (and had the largest enrollment in the country from 1997&ndash;2003), with nearly 50,000 undergraduate and graduate students and 16,500 faculty and staff.<ref name="EnrEss" /> It currently holds the largest enrollment of all colleges in the state of Texas. 

The university also operates various auxiliary facilities aside from the main campus, most notably the [[J. J. Pickle Research Campus]]. Texas is a major center for academic research, annually exceeding $380 million in funding. In addition, the university's athletic programs were recognized by ''[[Sports Illustrated]],'' which dubbed UT "America's Best Sports College" in 2002.

==History==
{{main|History of The University of Texas at Austin}}

The first mention of a public university in [[Texas]] can be traced to the 1827 constitution for the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]]. Although an article promised to establish public education in the arts and sciences, no action was ever taken by the Mexican government. After Texas obtained its independence from Mexico in 1836, the Congress of Texas adopted the [[Constitution of the Republic of Texas|Constitution of the Republic]], which included a provision to establish public education in [[Republic of Texas|republic]], including two universities or colleges. On [[January 26]], [[1839]], the Congress of Texas agreed to eventually set aside fifty [[league (unit)|league]]s of land towards the effort; in addition, forty acres in the new capital of Austin were reserved and designated "College Hill."
[[Image:Oldmainbuilding.jpg|right|thumbnail|The University's old Main Building in 1903.]]
In 1846, Texas was annexed into the [[United States]]. The state legislature passed the [[Act of 1858]], which set aside $100,000 in United States [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] towards construction. In addition, the legislature designated land, previously reserved for the encouragement of railroad construction, toward the universities' fifty leagues. However, Texas's [[secession]] from the Union and the [[American Civil War]] prevented further action on these plans.

The passing of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill Act]] in 1862 facilitated the creation of [[Texas A&M University]], which was established in 1876 as the Agricultural & Mechanical College of Texas.<ref>[http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/TT/kct8.html Texas A&M University] ''Handbook of Texas Online.'' Accessed [[29 July]] [[2006]].</ref> The [[Texas Constitution|Texas Constitution of 1876]] mandated that the state establish a university "at an early day," calling for the creation of a "university of the first class," The University of Texas. It revoked the endowment of the railroad lands of the Act of 1858 but appropriated one million acres (4000 km²) in West Texas. In 1883, another two million were granted, with income from the sale of land and [[grazing rights]] going to The University of Texas and Texas A&M. 
[[Image:uttower1.jpg|left|thumb|At {{convert|307|ft|m|abbr=on}}, the University of Texas Tower was designed by [[Paul Philippe Cret]] in 1931.<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/opa/news/99newsreleases/nr_199909/nr_tower990909.html UT Austin Tower information guide]</ref>]]

In 1881, Austin was chosen as the site of the main university, and Galveston was designated the location of the medical department. On the original "College Hill," an official ceremony began construction on what is now referred to as the old Main Building in late 1882. The university opened its doors on [[September 15]], [[1883]].

The old [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]]-[[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] [[Main Building of The University of Texas at Austin|Main Building]] served as the central point of the campus's forty acre site, and was used for nearly all purposes. However, by the 1930s, discussions rose about the need for new library space, and the Main Building was razed in 1934 over the objections of many students and faculty. The modern-day tower and Main Building were constructed in its place.

Constitutional restrictions against funding building construction hampered expansion. However, the funds generated by [[petroleum|oil]] discovered on university-owned grounds in 1923 were put towards its general endowment fund. This extra revenue allowed the university to pay down its debt, and pass bond in 1931 and 1947, funding the necessary expansion after the enrollment spike following [[World War II]]. The university built 19 permanent structures between 1950 and 1965, when it was given the right of [[eminent domain]]. With this power, the university purchased additional properties surrounding the original forty acres.

==Campus==
[[Image:Johnson library.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum]] adjacent to the [[Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs]] on the UT Austin campus.]]

Today, the university encompasses about 350 acres (1.4 km²) on its main campus adjacent to downtown Austin and about 850 acres (3.4 km²) overall, including the [[J.J. Pickle Research Campus]] in north Austin and other properties in Austin and throughout Texas.

One of the university's most visible features is the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] [[Main Building of The University of Texas at Austin|Main Building]], including a {{convert|307|ft|m|sing=on}} tower designed by [[Paul Philippe Cret]].<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/tours/mainbuilding/ The Main Building] ''The University of Texas.'' Accessed [[1 December]] [[2005]].</ref> Completed in 1937, the Main Building is located in the middle of campus. The tower usually appears illuminated in white light in the evening but is lit orange for various special occasions, including athletic victories and academic accomplishments, such as commencement. The tower is darkened for solemn occasions.<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/opa/pubs/oncampus/02oc_issues/oc020129/oc_tower.html University approves new policy for lighting UT Tower] ''On Campus.'' Accessed [[1 December]] [[2005]].</ref> At the top of the tower is a [[carillon]] of 56 bells, the largest in Texas. Songs are played on weekdays by resident carillonneur Tom Anderson, in addition to the usual pealing of [[Westminster Quarters]] every quarter hour between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m.

On [[August 1]] [[1966]], [[Charles Whitman]], a former [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. marine]] and [[architectural engineering]] major at the university, barricaded himself on the observation deck of the tower of the Main Building with a [[Remington 700]] 6 mm rifle and various other weapons. In the ensuing 96-minute stand-off, Whitman killed 14 people and wounded an additional 31 before himself being killed by police who stormed the observation tower.<ref>{{cite web | title=After decades of silence, UT acknowledged shootings | first=Victoria | last=Rossi | date=[[August 1]], [[2006]] | publisher=[[Daily Texan]] | url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/news/2006/08/01/TowerMassacre40YearsLater/After.Decades.Of.Silence.Ut.Acknowledged.Shootings-2142759.shtml | accessdate=2006-08-01}}</ref> Later, the observation deck was closed until 1968 and closed again in 1975 following a series of [[suicide]] jumps. During the time of the shooting, the tower was open to the public. However, in 1998, after the installation of security and safety measures, the observation deck reopened to the public available by weekend tours.<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/student/txunion/ae/towertours/?tours=schedule Tower Tours Schedule Fall 2005] ''The Texas Union.'' Accessed [[1 December]] [[2005]].</ref>

The university is home to seven museums and 17 libraries, which hold over eight million volumes.<ref>[http://www.lib.utexas.edu/admin/cird/statisticaloverview2005.html Statistical Overview of the Library Collections] ''The University of Texas Libraries.'' Accessed [[1 December]] [[2005]].</ref> The holdings of the university's [[Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center]] include one of only 21 remaining complete copies of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] worldwide and the first permanent photograph: ''View from the Window at Le Gras'' taken by [[Nicéphore Niépce]].<ref>[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/gutenberg/ The Gutenberg Bible at the Ransom Center] ''Harry Ransom Center.''

The 155,000 square foot (14,000 m²) museum hosts approximately 17,000 works from Europe, the United States, and Latin America. 

The university also contains an extensive underground [[tunnel]] system that links many of the buildings.<ref>[http://www.betterthanyourboyfriend.com/the-secret-tunnels-under-ut.htm The Secret Tunnels Under UT] ''Better Than Your Boyfriend.''</ref> The tunnel system is closed to the public and is guarded by [[burglar alarm|silent alarms]]. The tunnels are used for communications and utility service.

The university operates a 1.1 megawatt [[Nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactor]] at the J.J. Pickle Research Campus. The university's first reactor went critical, at Taylor Hall on the main campus, in August 1963 at 10 kW using fuel loaned from the [[federal government of the United States|U.S. Government]]. This reactor was upgraded to 250 kW in 1968.<ref name="Nuclear">>[http://www.me.utexas.edu/~nuclear/about.htm Nuclear Engineering Teaching Lab] ''Nuclear and Radiation Engineering Program.''

The university continues to expand its facilities on campus. In February 2006, the Board of Regents voted to update and expand the football stadium. On [[March 2]], [[2006]], the student body passed a referendum to build a new Student Activities Center next to Gregory Gym on the east side of campus, pending final approval by the Board of Regents. According to ''The Daily Texan'', the project is estimated to cost $51 million and is set to open between fall 2010 and fall 2012. Funding will primarily come from students, raising tuition by a maximum of $65 per semester.<ref>Terrell, Abby.

===Admission===
As a state public university, UT is subject to [[Texas House Bill 588]] (HB 588, popularly known as the top ten percent law). HB 588 states that a Texas resident graduating in the top 10% of their senior class from an accredited Texas high school will be guaranteed '''''admission''''' when they submit a complete application by the deadline.  However, HB 588 guarantees admission into the university only; it does not guarantee acceptance into a particular major, nor does it guarantee any scholarship or other form of tuition assistance (except for those who are class [[valedictorian]]; a pre-existing law guarantees these students a full 'tuition only' scholarship for their first year of college).

Students outside of top ten percent will be reviewed holistically and compete for admission. Things that are taken into consideration are the high school they attend and the level (AP courses, honors) of the curriculum they are taking.<ref>http://bealonghorn.utexas.edu/freshmen/admission/factors/academic/index.html</ref>

Their selectivity is deemed as "More selective" according to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.<ref>{{cite web |title=Carnegie Foundation Classifications of The University of Texas at Austin |url=http://carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/sub.asp?key=748&subkey=16431&start=782 |accessdate=2007-10-23}}</ref> In fall 2006, a total of 27,315 applications were received and 13,305 were admitted. In fall 2007, 27,232 applications and 13,781 students were admitted.<ref>{{cite web| title=Information, Resources and Services for Prospective Students |url=http://bealonghorn.utexas.edu/ |accessdate=2007-10-23}}</ref>

===Faculty and research===
As of 2004, the university employed 2,271 faculty members. Approximately 51.1% were [[tenure]]d, while an additional 17.8% were tenure track. The university's faculty includes winners of the [[Nobel Prize]], the [[Pulitzer Prize]], the [[National Medal of Science]], the [[National Medal of Technology]], and numerous other awards. Over 1,000 faculty positions are endowed by private funds. Since 1984, more than forty $1 million-endowed chairs have been created at The University of Texas to recruit distinguished faculty and facilitate research in the sciences and engineering.

The university exceeds $446 million in annual research funding<ref>http://www.utsystem.edu/news/fastfacts.html</ref>, and its facilities house more than 90 research units. UT has earned more than 400 patents since its founding. In 2005, Texas secured $417 million in awards and grants, a new university record. In addition, Texas earned $5 million in licensing revenue and capped a six-year funding increase of 48%. The university has also reached out to establish partnerships with other facilities, including [[University of Texas Medical Branch|The University of Texas Medical Branch]] in Galveston, [[University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio|The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio]], the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]] of [[NASA]], the [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]], and the International Center for Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials.<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/research/about/2005report/ Report on Research 2005] ''The University of Texas Office of the VP for Research.'' Accessed [[December 2]], [[2005]].</ref>

In addition to research in traditional fields, scientists are pushing forward in several new, interdisciplinary areas, including nanotechnology and materials engineering for next-generation semiconductors. In addition, Texas is advancing high performance computing through the [[Texas Advanced Computing Center]] (TACC), which supports over 600 projects in the natural sciences, engineering, and business.

The university receives income from an endowment known as the [[Permanent University Fund]] (PUF), with $11.6 billion ([[List of U.S. colleges and universities by endowment|fourth]]-largest in the [[United States]]) in assets as of November 2005,<ref name="endowment">{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.nacubo.org/x2321.xml|title=2005 NACUBO Endowment Study|publisher=National Association of College and University Business Officers|accessdate=2006-05-25}}</ref> of which 30 percent is dedicated to the university.<ref name="30-percent">As required by the Texas Constitution[http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/txconst/sections/cn000700-001800.html], the UT System gets two-thirds of the [[Available University Fund]], the annual distribution of PUF income. A regental policy[http://www.utsystem.edu/OGC/RegentalPolicies/AUFspend.htm] requires that ''at least'' 45 percent of this money go to UT Austin for "program enrichment." By taking two-thirds and multiplying it by 45 percent, we get 30 percent which is the ''minimum'' amount of AUF income that can be distributed to UT Austin under current policies. The Regents, however, can and do decide to allocate additional amounts to UT Austin. Also, the majority of the UT System share of the AUF is used for debt service of UT System [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], some of which were issued for the benefit of UT Austin[http://www.utsystem.edu/CONT/REPORTS/LARs/AUFLAR-102704.pdf]. One should note that the Regents are free to change the 45 percent minimum of the UT System share going to UT Austin at any time, although doing so might be difficult politically.</ref> Proceeds from lands appropriated in 1839 and 1876, as well as oil monies, comprise the majority of this fund. At one time, the PUF was the chief source of income for Texas's two university systems, The University of Texas System and [[Texas A&M University System|the Texas A&M University System]]; today, however, its revenues account for less than 10  percent of the universities' annual budgets. This has challenged the universities to increase sponsored research and private donations. Privately funded endowments contribute over $2 billion to the University's total endowment value.

==Student life==
The university enrolls 37,377 undergraduate, 11,533 graduate and 1,467 law students. The student population includes students from all 50 states and more than 100 foreign countries, most notably, [[South Korea]], followed by [[India]], the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Mexico]] and the [[Republic of China]], are represented.<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/academic/oir/statistical_handbook/04-05/students/analysis/ 2004-2005 Statistical Handbook, Degrees Conferred] ''The University of Texas Office of Institutional Research.'' Accessed [[1 December]] [[2005]].</ref> The average [[SAT]] score for entering Fall 2004 [[First year|freshmen]] was a 1230 out of 1600.

===Housing===
The campus is currently home to fourteen residence halls, the last of which opened for residence in Spring 2007. On-campus housing can hold more than 7,100 students.<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/student/housing/pdfs/reshall_masterplan_100405.pdf Residence Hall Master Plan] ''The University of Texas Division of Housing and Food.''

Accessed [[December 2]], [[2005]].</ref>  Academic enrollment exceeds the capacity of on-campus housing; as a result, most students must live in private residence halls, [[housing cooperative]]s, apartments, or with [[fraternities and sororities|Greek organization]]s and other off-campus residences.  The Division of Housing and Food Service, which already has the largest market share of 7,000 of the estimated 27,000 beds in the campus area, plans to expand to 9,000 beds in the near future.<ref name="Texan-housing">{{cite news | url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2006/08/03/TopStories/Ut.Residences.To.Expand-2143178.shtml?norewrite200608032103&sourcedomain=www.dailytexanonline.com | title=UT residences to expand | publisher=The Daily Texan | date=[[3 August]] [[2006]] | accessdate=2006-08-03}}</ref>

The University of Texas offers a wide variety of varsity and intramural sports programs. Due to the breadth of sports offered and the quality of the programs, Texas was selected as "America's Best Sports College" in a 2002 analysis performed by ''[[Sports Illustrated]].''<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/news/2002/10/01/1_10/ America's Best Sports Colleges] ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.

However this ranking is based only on clients of the Collegiate Licensing Company which does not handle licensing for approximately three dozen large schools such as Ohio State, Southern California, UCLA, Michigan State, and Texas A&M.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/sports/stories/longhorns/08/16/0816royalties.html|title=Texas repeats as national champion in merchandising|publisher=''[[The Austin American-Statesman]]''|accessdate=2007-08-17|date=2007-08-16|author=Maher, John}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clc.com/clcweb/publishing.nsf/Content/rankings.html|title=The Collegiate Licensing Company Rankings|accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref>

In recent years, the men's [[college basketball|basketball]] team has gained prominence, advancing to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] Sweet Sixteen in 2002, the Final Four in 2003, the Sweet Sixteen in 2004, and the [[Elite Eight]] in 2006.

The university's [[college baseball|baseball]] team is considered one of the best in the nation with more trips to the [[College World Series]] than any other school, with wins in 1949, 1950, 1970, 1983, 2002 and 2005.

Additionally, the university's highly successful men's and women's swimming and diving teams lay claim to sixteen NCAA Division I titles.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} In particular, the men's team is under the leadership of Eddie Reese, who served as the head men's coach at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, and the 2004 Games in Athens.

===Rivalries===
One of the university's notable rivals in many sports is [[Texas A&M Athletics|Texas A&amp;M University]].<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/magazine/features/si50/states/texas/ Sports Illustrated's 50th Anniversary: Texas] ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' poll (conducted by [[Harris Interactive]]) shows 56% of respondents picked Texas vs Texas A&M as the biggest rivalry, followed by Texas vs Oklahoma at 15%, and the Cowboys vs Texans at 7%.</ref> The two schools have acknowledged the importance of this rivalry by creating the [[State Farm]] [[Lone Star Showdown]] series, which encompasses all sports where both schools field a varsity team. The football game played between the two schools is the third longest-running rivalry in the nation and is the longest-running rivalry for both schools. The game used to be played on Thanksgiving day but in recent years has been played on the day following [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. Both schools traditionally hold a rally each year before the football game &mdash; Texas hosts the [[Hex Rally]], and students at Texas A&M host the [[Aggie Bonfire#Revival|Aggie Bonfire]] (although it is no longer an officially sanctioned Texas A&M event because of the deaths of 12 students in 1999). 

Some fans and observers, however, argue that the Longhorns' biggest rival in football is the [[University of Oklahoma]].<ref>[http://totaljibbly.blogspot.com/2005/11/season-it-never-fails.html The Season] ''Total Jibbly''. [[November 22]], [[2005]].</ref>  The football game between Texas and Oklahoma is known as the [[Red River Shootout]] and is held annually in [[Dallas, Texas]] at the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]].  In recent years, this rivalry has been particularly spirited, in part due to the fact that at least one school had been ranked in the top five nationally at the time of the game (from 2000-05).

Other schools, such as Arkansas and [[Texas Tech Red Raiders|Texas Tech]], also consider Texas among their rivals.<ref>[http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/preview?gid=200610280086 Texas Longhorns/Texas Tech Raiders Preview Saturday, October 28, 2006] ''[http://sports.yahoo.com/ Yahoo!
