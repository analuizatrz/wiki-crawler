'''Braniewo''' (until 1945 {{Audio-de|Braunsberg|Braunsberg.ogg}}, {{lang-pl|Brunsberga}}) is a town in northeastern [[Poland]], in the [[Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship]], with a population of 18,068 (2004). It is the capital of [[Braniewo County]]. Located on the [[Pasłęka]] River, about five km from the [[Vistula Lagoon]], Braniewo lies about halfway between [[Gdańsk]] and the [[Russia]]n city of [[Kaliningrad]].

==History==

[[Image:Braniewo 1684.jpg|thumb|left|250px|General view of Braunsberg in 1684 - [[Engraving]] ]]
During the [[Northern Crusades|conquest]] and [[Christianization]] of Prussia, the [[Teutonic Knights]] conquered an [[Old Prussians|Old Prussian]] settlement named ''Brusebergue'' in 1240 and built a new town atop it on the [[Pasłęka|Passarge (Pasłęka)]] River. The German name of this new city was ''Braunsberg'' (literally "Brown's Mountain"), although it was probably derived from a [[Germanization]] (''Brus-berg'' and ''Brunsberg'') of the older Prussian name or possibly named after Saint [[Bruno of Querfurt]]. In 1243 the city, together with the surrounding region of [[Warmia]], was given by the Order to the newly created [[Archbishopric of Warmia]], whose [[Bishops of Warmia|bishop]] built his cathedral in the city and made it his chief residence. In 1254 Braunsberg was granted its [[Lübeck law]] [[town privileges]] but was soon destroyed and depopulated in the second uprising of native Prussians (in 1261). It was rebuilt in a new location in 1273 and settled by newcomers from [[Lübeck]]. In 1284 given a new city charter, again based on the city charter of Lübeck. However, the next bishop, [[Heinrich I Fleming]] (1278-1300) transferred the chapter from Braunsberg to [[Frombork|Frauenburg (Frombork)]] where it remained until the 20th century.

In 1296 a [[Franciscan]] abbey was built in Braunsberg, and in 1342 a "new city" (still called ''Neustadt'' or ''Nowe Miasto'') was added. The city became a prosperous member of the [[Hanseatic League]]. It remained a part of the [[Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights]] until 1466, when as a consequence of the [[Peace of Toruń 1466|Second Peace of Toruń]] ending the [[Thirteen Years' War]], the city passed to the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] as part of the new autonomous province of [[Royal Prussia]]. In 1487 it withstood a siege by Polish troops during the [[War of the Priests]].

During the reign of Duke [[Albert I, Duke of Prussia|Albert]] in neighboring [[Ducal Prussia]], a large part of Braunsberg's populace converted to [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Protestantism]]. Albert sought to unite [[Warmia]] with Ducal Prussia, causing the Catholics of the city to swear allegiance to the king of Poland in return for aid against Protestant Prussia. In 1526 a Polish royal commission released Braunsberg's burghers from the oath to the Polish king and handed the city back to Prince-Bishop [[Mauritius Ferber]]. Braunsberg again swore allegiance to the Prince-Bishops of Warmia, but had to denounce all Lutheran teachings and hand over Lutheran writings.

The city suffered from warfare and the church tower was not rebuilt until 1544, when Prince-Bishop [[Johannes Dantiscus]] ordered 20 [[zentner]] copper from [[Anton Fugger]] in [[Augsburg]]. It could only be paid off slowly with yearly payments of 100 [[Mark (money)|marks]]. For many years Braunsberg was not able to directly attend Hanseatic meetings; it was not until 1557 that representatives attended session in Lübeck again.

Braunsberg was occupied by [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] for several years during the [[Livonian War]].

During Prince-Bishop [[Stanislaus Hosius]]' government, Lutheran teachings again became popular in the city. They were suppressed when Hosius brought in the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] and founded the [[Collegium Hosianum]] [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. The Jesuit theologian [[Antonius Possevinus]] was instrumental in enlarging the Collegium Hosianum to receive [[Swedes]]. A priest seminary was added in 1564. [[Pope Gregory XIII]] later added a papal mission seminary for northern and eastern European countries. [[Regina Protmann]], a native of Braunsberg, founded the [[Saint Catherine]] Order of Sisters in the town, recognized by the church in 1583.

The ethnically German, politically Polish, and primarily Catholic city was annexed by the mostly Protestant [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1772 during the [[Partitions of Poland|First Partition of Poland]]. The city obtained its first railway connection in 1852. In 1871 it became part of the newly established [[German Empire]].

Next to [[Kaliningrad|Königsberg]], Braunsberg was the leading academic center of Prussia. In 1912 the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] college became the State Academy of Braunsberg ({{lang-de|Staatliche Akademie Braunsberg}}).

During [[World War II]] Braunsberg was captured by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] in 1945 and suffered heavy destruction due to fighting and subsequent looting. The German inhabitants of the city were either [[Evacuation of East Prussia|evacuated]] before the Soviet army arrived, killed during the fighting, or [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled]] to Germany after the war.

The city of Braunberg, previously known as ''Brunsberga'' in older Polish records, became Polish in 1945 and was given the current name ''Braniewo''.

In 2001 the St. Catherine Church, built in 1346, destroyed in 1945, and rebuilt after 1979, was declared a Basilica Minor (''Bazylika Mniejsza''). This Gothic Hall church was built on a site, which held a previous wooden Church of St. Catherine since 1280. Prince-Bishop [[Lucas Watzenrode]] of Warmia had added extensively to the building.
