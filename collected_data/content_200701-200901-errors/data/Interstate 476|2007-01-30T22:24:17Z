'''Interstate 476''' is a 130.5-mile long Interstate highway that travels between [[I-95]] near [[Chester, Pennsylvania]] and [[I-81]] near [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. Since its completion in [[1996]], I-476 has been the longest auxiliary [[interstate highway]] in the [[United States]].

The route consists of both the 20.5-mile '''Mid-County Expressway''' (locally referred to as the '''Blue Route''') through the [[Philadelphia]] suburbs, and the 110-mile '''Northeast Extension''' of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] connecting the western Philadelphia area with the [[Lehigh Valley]], the [[Poconos]], and the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]]-[[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]] metropolitan area.

==Exit list==
Until [[2002]], the mileposts on the Northeast Extension portion of I-476 started over at zero from the beginning of the Extension at the mainline Turnpike; additionally the exits were numbered sequentially as a continuation of the mainline Turnpike's numbering, starting with 31 at the [[Lansdale, Pennsylvania|Lansdale]] exit. In 2002, as part of a statewide transition from sequential to mileage-based [[Exit number|exit numbering]], [[PennDOT]] and the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission]] renumbered the mileposts and exits along the entire length of I-476 as one continuous highway.

== History ==

=== The Mid-County Expressway ===

The portion of Interstate 476 between [[Interstate 95]] and [[Interstate 276]], running north-south through [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania]] is officially known as the '''Mid-County Expressway''', as well as the '''Veterans Memorial Highway'''.  Originally planned as far back as 1928, I-476 was later proposed as the "Chester Extension" of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in the late 1940's.  Since the beginnings of the Interstate Highway system, the PA Turnpike Commission dropped the Chester Extension project and the forerunner to the present-day Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) picked up the project, designating it first as '''Interstate 480''' (as I-76 back then was designated as I-80S), and later as I-495. The present-day I-476 designation was assigned in 1974 when I-80S was renumbered as I-76.

The road recieved its ubiquitous nickname, the '''Blue Route''', from a 1958 location report indicating various proposed geographic configurations of an expressway through [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]] with lines of various colors on a map.  The "blue route" won out over other contenders, which included a more easterly "red route" and "yellow route" and a more westerly "green route".

As one of the most controversial Interstate Highways in Pennsylvania, construction of I-476 began in 1968, but was not completed until [[1991]], due mainly to litigation between the [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation]] and residents in [[Marple Township, Pennsylvania]].  An agreement in [[1984]] led to the present lane configuration.  The compromise, due to Swarthmore residents' desire to limit pollution to its district, led to the throttling down from three lanes of traffic in each direction to two. Ironically, this has led to bottleneck conditions in the area, and ultimately, more pollution from slowed down vehicles spending more time in this stretch of roadway {{fact}}. The connection with the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] was not completed until [[1994]]. [[Image:I476_Blue_Route_Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The birth of the "Blue Route" nickname.]]
The highway is designated as a federal scenic route, thus prohibiting the erection of advertisement billboards along the entire freeway portion. This designation was tested shortly after [[9/11]] when two local residents took it upon themselves to erect a flagpole bearing the [[American Flag]] at the [[Pennsylvania Route 3]] interchange of the roadway, which officials initially believed was a violation of the prohibition; however, the flag remains erect to this day. A private resident also displays illuminated "[[Jesus]]" signage above the northbound lanes near the interchange with [[U.S. Route 1]] in Marple Township, narrowly avoiding violation since the sign is technically on private property that just happens to face the highway.

In [[2005]], work began on a massive, yet much-needed, rehabilitation between [[Interstate 95]] and [[Pennsylvania Route 3]].  Paving, bridge repair, and ramp maintenance were just a sampling of the improvements performed on the roadway.  Construction continued in [[2006]] with the section between PA 3 and [[Interstate 76 (east)|Interstate 76]], with [[2007]] being slated for the total rehabilitation of the origial pre-1970 section between I-76 and the PA Turnpike. Several long-term solutions for the Marple Township/Swarthmore bottleneck conditions have been proposed, from an extension of the [[Norristown High Speed Line]] connecting Montgomery County with the [[Media-Sharon Hill Trolley]], via 69th Street Terminal in [[Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania|Upper Darby]], to an outright widening project favored by local Congressman [[Jim Gerlach]] and former Congressman [[Curt Weldon]], U.S. Senator [[Arlen Specter]], and other local politicians.

It remains one of the few highways in the [[Philadelphia]] region to feature [[ramp meter]]s, which utilize a type of traffic signal that controls the amount of vehicles entering the road during [[rush hour]]s.  Deactivated for a lengthy period of time shortly after their initial installation, [[PennDOT]] recently decided to reintroduce the meters to ease massive traffic flow from the [[MacDade Boulevard]], [[Baltimore Pike]], [[U.S. Route 1]], [[Pennsylvania Route 3]], and [[U.S. Highway 30]] interchanges.

=== The Northeast Extension ===

[[Image:Exit44_476.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Standard Turnpike guide sign along the Northeast Extension portion of I-476]] The portion of Interstate 476 north of the I-276 interchange is known as the '''Northeast Extension''' of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] system. The 110-mile [[Toll road|toll road]] opened in stages from November 23, 1955 to November 7, 1957, and was originally designated '''Pennsylvania Route 9'''.

The highway includes a major, 4,461-foot tunnel through [[Blue Mountain]] known as the '''Lehigh Tunnel'''.  The tunnel was named "Lehigh Tunnel" so as not to cause confusion with the existing Blue Mountain tunnel on the mainline.  The tunnel was originally to be named for Turnpike Commission chairman Thomas J. Evans, but this was changed due to his [[July 25]], [[1967]] conviction for conspiracy to defraud the Turnpike Commission of $19 million. [http://www.pahighways.com/toll/PATurnpike.html] The Lehigh Tunnel was originally a two-lane tunnel, in the manner of the mainline turnpike's original seven tunnels, until it was "twinned" in the early 1990's. The project to do so was notably the first tunneling project in the United States to use the [[New Austrian Tunnelling method]].

On [[November 1, 1996]], after the expansion of the Lehigh Tunnel and the completion of the I-276/I-476/PA 9 interchange, the I-476 designation was extended up the entire length of the Northeast Extension, supplanting the PA 9 designation. This extension resulted in I-476 surpassing the 120-mile [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] in [[Massachusetts]] as the longest auxiliary Interstate highway.
