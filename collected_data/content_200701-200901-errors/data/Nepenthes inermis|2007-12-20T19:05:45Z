'''''Nepenthes inermis''''' ({{pronEng|nəˈpɛnθiːz ɪnˈɚmɪs}}) is a tropical [[pitcher plant]] [[endemism|endemic]] to [[Sumatra]]. The [[specific epithet]] ''inermis'' is [[Latin]] for "unarmed" and probably refers to the upper pitchers of this species, which are unique in that they completely lack a [[peristome]].

==Botanical history==
''N. inermis'' was first collected on [[September 7]], [[1918]], by [[H. A. B. Bünnemeijer]] on [[Mount Talang]], at an altitude of 2590 m above sea level.{{Ref_label|A|I|none}} Two further collections were made by Bünnemeijer on [[Bukit Gombak]] on [[November 16]], [[1918]], at 2300 m{{Ref_label|B|II|none}} and 2330 m.{{Ref_label|C|III|none}} A fourth specimen was taken on [[April 26]], [[1920]], from an elevation of 1800 m on [[Mount Kerintji]].<ref name=Danser>Danser, B.H. 1928.

''Bulletin de Jardin de Botanique, Buitenzorg'', Série III, '''9'''(3–4): 249–438.</ref>{{Ref_label|D|IV|none}} This final specimen, ''Bünnemeijer 9695'', was later designated as the [[lectotype]] of ''N. inermis'' by [[Matthew Jebb]] and [[Martin Cheek]].<ref name=J&C>Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R. Cheek 1997. A Skeletal Revision of ''Nepenthes'' (Nepenthaceae). ''Blumea'' '''42'''(1): 1–106.</ref>

[[Image:Nepenthes inermis.gif|thumb|left|150px|Herbarium specimens of ''N. inermis'' illustrated by B.&nbsp;H.&nbsp; Danser]]

''N. dubia'' was first illustrated in an issue of ''De Tropische Natuur'' published in 1927.<ref>Danser, B.H. 1927. Indische bekerplanten. ''De Tropische Natuur'' '''16''': 197–205.</ref> A year later, [[B. H. Danser]] formally described ''N. inermis'' in his seminal monograph "[[The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies]]".{{Ref_label|E|V|none}} He wrote: "This new species is easily distinguishable from all others by the peculiar pitchers without peristome and with very narrow lid. Probably it is most nearly related to ''N. Bongso''."<ref name=Danser />

Several of the specimens collected by Bünnemeijer were labeled with the local vernacular names ''galoe-galoe antoe'' and ''kandjong baroek''. Danser noted that these originate from the [[Minangkabau language]] and are also used to refer to other species, but stated that their meaning was not clear to him.<ref name=Danser />

In 1986, [[Mitsuru Hotta]] and [[Rusjdi Tamin]] included plant material belonging to ''N. dubia'' and ''N. inermis'' in their description of ''[[Nepenthes bongso|N. bongso]]''.<ref name=T&H>Tamin, R. & M. Hotta 1986. ''Nepenthes'' di Sumatera: The genus ''Nepenthes'' of the Sumatra Island. In: M. Hotta (ed.) ''Diversity and Dynamics of Plant Life in Sumatra 1''. Kyoto University, Japan. pp. 75–109.</ref><ref name=Clarke>Clarke, C.M. 2001. ''Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia''.  Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu.</ref>

In a 1993 study of ''Nepenthes'' prey and [[Nepenthes infauna|pitcher infauna]], the same authors, together with M. Kato and T. Itino, identified ''N. inermis'' from [[Mount Gadut]] as ''N. bongso''.<ref name=Kato>Kato, M., M. Hotta, R. Tamin & T. Itino 1993. Inter- and intra-specific variation in prey assemblages and inhabitant communities in ''Nepenthes'' pitchers in Sumatra. ''Tropical Zoology'' '''6''': 11–25.</ref><ref name=Clarke />

Despite this taxonomic confusion, ''N. bongso'' differs considerably in pitcher morphology from ''N. inermis'' and is not easily confused with it.

==Description==
''N. inermis'' is a climbing plant. The stem can reach 5 m in length and is up to 5 mm in diameter. It is cylindrical-triangular in cross section. [[Internode]]s are up to 10 cm long.<ref name=Clarke />

[[Image:Nepenthes inermis2.jpg|thumb|left|A climbing stem of ''N. inermis'' with upper pitchers]]

Leaves are [[wikt:sessile|sessile]] and [[wikt:coriaceous|coriaceous]]. The [[lamina]] is [[wikt:lanceolate|lanceolate]]-[[wikt:spathulate|spathulate]] in form. It may be up to 12 cm long and 3 cm wide. It has an acute or obtuse apex and is gradually [[wikt:attenuate|attenuate]] towards the base, which clasps the stem and is not [[wikt:decurrent|decurrent]]. Three longitudinal veins are present on either side of the [[midrib]]. [[wikt:pinnate|Pinnate]] veins are [[wikt:reticulate|reticulate]]. [[Tendril]]s can be up to 15 cm long and may or may not have a curl.<ref name=Clarke />

Rosette and lower pitchers are rarely produced. They are [[wikt:infundibular|infundibular]] in the lower two-thirds to three-quarters, and ovoid above. They are distinctly constricted just below the peristome. Terrestrial pitchers grow to 8 cm in height and 3 cm in width. Fringed wings are usually absent, but may be present in the upper part. The pitcher mouth is round and horizontal, and raised slightly towards the rear. The peristome is cylindrical, up to 3 mm wide, and bears indistinct teeth. The lid or [[operculum (botany)|operculum]] is ovate and lacks appendages. An unbranched [[spur (biology)|spur]] (≤4 mm long) is inserted at the base of the lid.<ref name=Clarke />

[[Image:Nepenthes inermis3.jpg|thumb|Unopened upper pitcher]]

The unusual upper pitchers of ''N. inermis'' are larger than its lower pitchers, growing to 9 cm in height and 5 cm in width.<ref name=Danser /> They gradually or abruptly arise from the ends of the tendrils, forming a 10 to 20 mm wide curve.<ref name=Danser /> They are tubular to infundibular in the lower two-thirds with laterally appressed pitcher walls. As in ''N. dubia'', there is almost no gap between the walls in mature pitchers. The upper part of the pitcher is widely infundibular throughout. Wings are reduced to ribs in upper pitchers. The mouth is round and either horizontal or slightly raised at the front and rear. Mature upper pitchers completely lack a peristome, a trait that is unique to this species. The lid is very long, narrow, and [[wikt:cuneiform|cuneiform]]. It is never reflexed beyond 90 degrees relative to the mouth.<ref name=Clarke />

''N. inermis'' has a [[raceme|racemose]] [[inflorescence]]. The [[peduncle]] may be up to 5 cm long. The [[rachis]] grows to 15 cm in length, although it is usually shorter in female inflorescences. [[Pedicel]]s are [[bract]]eolate and up to 8 mm long. [[Sepal]]s are oblong-lanceolate and up to 3 mm long.<ref name=Clarke />

Young parts of the plant, such as developing pitchers, are covered in a dense [[indumentum]]. However, most hairs are [[wikt:caducous|caducous]] and mature parts are virtually [[wikt:glabrous|glabrous]]. An exception to this are the hairs on the [[Ovary (plants)|ovary]] and some other parts of the inflorescence, which may be persistent.<ref name=Clarke />

The stem, inflorescence and tendrils are characteristically purplish-red in most plants. The lamina is green, often with a red midrib. Pitchers are yellowish-green.<ref name=Clarke /> Danser described the colour of herbarium specimens as "blackish in all parts".<ref name=Danser />

==Ecology==
''N. inermis'' is [[endemism|endemic]] to a number peaks in the [[Barisan Mountains]] that line the western side of [[Sumatra]]. More specifically, it is known only from the [[Indonesia]]n provinces of [[West Sumatra]] and [[Jambi]]. ''N. inermis'' has an altitudinal distribution of 1500 to 2600 m above sea level. It usually grows as an [[epiphyte]] in [[mossy forest]], but also occurs terrestrially in stunted upper montane vegetation above 2000 m.<ref name=Clarke />

Substantial populations of this species are present on [[Mount Talang]], [[Mount Gadut]], and [[Mount Belirang]]. ''N. inermis'' is particularly abundant on the western slopes of the latter, where it grows terrestrially.<ref name=Clarke />

The [[conservation status]] of ''N. inermis'' is listed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] on the [[IUCN Red List|2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]].<ref name=IUCN>Schnell, D., P. Catling, G. Folkerts, C. Frost, R. Gardner, ''et al.'' 2000. [http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/40112/all ''Nepenthes inermis'']. ''[[IUCN Red List|2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]]''. [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]] 2006. Retrieved on 11 May 2006. Listed as Vulnerable (VU A1c v2.3).</ref>

==Carnivory==
''N. inermis'' produces extremely thick [[mucilage|mucilaginous]] pitcher liquid. It is so viscous that if a pitcher is held upside down, the fluid will pour out forming an unbroken stream several metres in length.<ref name=trip>Hopkins, M., R. Maulder & B.[R.] Salmon 1990. {{PDFlink|[http://www.carnivorousplants.org/cpn/articles/CPNv19n1_2p19_28.pdf A real nice trip to Southeast Asia.]|1.72&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 1808573 bytes -->}} ''[[Carnivorous Plant Newsletter]]'' '''19'''(1–2): 19–28.</ref><ref name=Salmon>Salmon, B.[R.] 1993. {{PDFlink|[http://www.carnivorousplants.org/cpn/articles/CPNv22n1_2p11_12.pdf Some observations on the trapping mechanisms of ''Nepenthes inermis'' and ''N. rhombicaulis''.]|148&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 151585 bytes -->}} ''[[Carnivorous Plant Newsletter]]'' '''22'''(1–2): 11–12.</ref> This fluid coats the entire inner surfaces of the pitchers in a thin film. The pitchers of ''N. inermis'' function not only as [[Carnivorous_plant#Pitfall_traps|pitfall traps]] but also as [[Carnivorous_plant#Flypaper_traps|flypaper traps]], with the sticky inner walls trapping flying insects above the surface of the fluid.<ref name=Clarke /><ref>Rice, B. 2007. Carnivorous plants with hybrid trapping strategies. ''[[Carnivorous Plant Newsletter]]'' '''36'''(1): 23–27.</ref> The fluid also acts as a [[lubricant]], allowing prey items to easily slide down into the bottom of the pitcher cup.<ref name=Clarke />

The upper pitchers of ''N. inermis'' are frequenty tipped over during downpours. The rainwater that accumulates in them is lost, but the extremely viscous fluid, together with the laterally appressed walls, ensure that the contents is retained. No longer holding heavy rainwater, the pitchers quickly spring back to an upright position.<ref name=Clarke /><ref name=Clarke1997>Clarke, C.[M.] 1997. {{PDFlink|[http://www.carnivorousplants.org/cpn/articles/CPNv26n1p4_10.pdf Another Nice Trip to Sumatra.]|1.57&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 1647999 bytes -->}} ''[[Carnivorous Plant Newsletter]]'' '''26'''(1): 4–10.</ref>

A similar trapping method may be employed by related species such as ''[[Nepenthes dubia|N. dubia]]'', which also produce very viscous pitcher fluid.<ref name=Clarke />

''N. inermis'' pitchers mostly trap flying insects, particularly [[fly|flies]] of the suborders [[Nematocera]] and [[Brachycera]]. However, they do not normally contain [[invertebrate]] [[Nepenthes infauna|pitcher infauna]].<ref name=Kato />

It has been suggested that glands on the lid secrete compounds that intoxicate visiting insects, such that they lose their footing and fall into the pitcher.<ref name=Salmon /><ref name=Clarke1997 />

These species are characterised by infundibular upper pitchers and highly viscous pitcher fluid.

''N. inermis'' is thought to be most closely related to ''[[Nepenthes dubia|N. dubia]]''.

In 2001, [[Charles Clarke (botanist)|Charles Clarke]] performed a [[cladistic analysis]] of the ''Nepenthes'' species of Sumatra and [[Peninsular Malaysia]] using 70 morphological characteristics of each taxon.

==Natural hybrids==

{{main|Nepenthes × pyriformis}}

''N. inermis'' is known to hybridise with ''[[Nepenthes talangensis|N. talangensis]]'' on the upper slopes of [[Mount Talang]], where the two species grow sympatrically. ''N. talangensis'' was only described as a distinct species in 1994.<ref name=N&W>Nerz, J. & A. Wistuba 1994. [http://www.carnivorousplants.org/cpn/Species/v23n4p101_114.html Five new taxa of ''Nepenthes'' (Nepenthaceae) from North and West Sumatra]. ''[[Carnivorous Plant Newsletter]]'' '''23'''(4): 101–114.</ref> Prior to this it was placed within ''[[Nepenthes bongso|N. bongso]]'' and some of the older literature identifies this hybrid as ''N. bongso'' &times; ''N. inermis''.<ref name=trip />

''N. inermis'' &times; ''N. talangensis'' has been the subject of taxonomic confusion in the past. In an article published in 1973 on the ''Nepenthes'' of Borneo, Singapore, and Sumatra, botanist [[Shigeo Kurata]] incorrectly identified specimens of this hybrid  as belonging to ''N. dubia''.<ref name=Kurata>Kurata, S. 1973. ''Nepenthes'' from Borneo, Singapore and Sumatra. ''Gardens' Bulletin Singapore'' '''26'''(2): 227–232.</ref><ref name=Clarke />

In 1997, [[Matthew Jebb]] and [[Martin Cheek]] published their monograph "A Skeletal Revision of ''Nepenthes'' (Nepenthaceae)", in which they referred to ''N. dubia'' plant material from [[Mount Talang]] (''Kurata s.n.'' SING).<ref name=J&C /> [[Charles Clarke (botanist)|Charles Clarke]] later identified ''Kurata s.n.'' as representing ''N. inermis'' &times; ''N. talangensis''.

The natural hybrid is similar to ''N. dubia'', but can be distinguished on the basis of several stable characters. The hybrid has a wider pitcher lid that is never relfexed beyond 90 degrees and the pitcher cup is not appressed in the lower parts as in ''N. dubia''. In addition, the mouth of ''N. inermis'' &times; ''N. talangensis'' is raised towards the back as opposed to being horizontal.<ref name=Clarke />

In 2001, Kurata described this hybrid as a new species, ''N. pyriformis''.<ref>Kurata, S. 2001. Two new species of ''Nepenthes'' from Sumatra (Indonesia) and Mindanao (Philippines). ''Journal of the Insectivorous Plant Society (Japan)'' '''52'''(2): 30–34.</ref> Clarke rejected this interpretation in his monograph ''Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia'', published the same year. Clarke found that the [[type specimen]] of ''N. pyriformis'', ''Kurata & Mikil 4230'' NDC, matches the appearance of ''N. inermis'' &times; ''N. talangensis'' "in most respects".<ref name=Clarke />

===Other hybrids===
Where their ranges overlap, ''N. inermis'' is also known to hybridise with ''[[Nepenthes singalana|N. singalana]]'' and ''[[Nepenthes spathulata|N. spathulata]]''.<ref name=Clarke />
