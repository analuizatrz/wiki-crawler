==Early years==
[[Image:Claude Vorilhon (right).png|thumb|left|Raël/Claude Vorilhon (right)]]
The beginnings of Raëlian history goes back to the history of Raël, which concerns the origins of Raël, his personage, and his works, which developed from Claude Vorilhon.  The personage purportedly began as the result of encounters described in Raelian Messages, mainly from ''The Book Which Tells the Truth'' (1974) and ''Extraterrestrials Took Me to their Planet'' (1975).  None of these encounters is verified from a factual standpoint but they tie in to the beliefs of Raëlians.

Raëlian books are a primary source of Raël's history.  Translated portions of the original text are distributed freely worldwide in 33 languages through [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]].<ref name="The Raelian Movement: Downloads">[http://rael.org/download.php The Raelian Movement: Downloads], ''The International Raëlian Movement''. 2007. Retrieved [[3 April]] [[2007]].</ref>   Some of the books include the contents of multiple [[Raëlian Church|Raelian]] books and have testimonials, footnotes, updates, and hyperlinks appended to them.  In addition to the Raëlian books, a Canadian sociologist named [[Susan J. Palmer]] writes about Raël's struggle to organize the young Raëlian movement.<ref name="Palmer, pp. 37-8, 57.">Palmer, pp. 37-8, 57.</ref>

===Founding===
According to Raëlian beliefs, on the morning of [[December 13]], [[1973]] ([[Julian Date]] 2442029),<ref name="GMT+1">In France, Julian Dates 2442030 and 2442696 begin at 1:00 P.m. on [[December 13]], [[1973]] and [[October 10]], [[1975]], respectively. All times are GMT +1:00.</ref> Claude Vorilhon &mdash; who was at the time a professional test driver and automobile [[journalist]] for the Autopop Magazine &mdash; had a first meeting with an extraterrestrial humanoid, an Eloha (plural: Elohim), who landed a UFO within an inactive volcano called [[:fr:Puy de Lassolas|Puy de Lassolas]] near the capital of [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]], [[France]] ([[Clermont-Ferrand]]).<ref name="Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 3-9.">Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 3-9.</ref>

Two days later, in the third meeting, an Eloha referred to [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] insignias: one engraved his spaceship and one on his spacesuit.  Both were formed by interlocked triangles which according to the Eloha, means "as above, so below" enclosing [[swastika]] which means "all is cyclic in infinite time". In Raëlism, the [[swastika]] symbolizes, "The choice between paradise, which the peaceful use of science makes possible, and the hell of returning to the primitive stage where humanity submits to nature instead of dominating and benefiting from it." This is the original emblem of the Raelian Movement which is used primarily in the African and Asian continents.<ref name="Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 62.">Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 62.</ref> 

Three days later, Claude Vorilhon meets Yahweh Elohim for the last time that year on a Tuesday. On that day, Vorilhon was given the name for the religious movement which he was to establish. The six-letter name is "MADECH", which stands for "''m''ouvement pour l‘''a''ccueil ''d''es ''E''lohim ''c''réateurs de l’''h''umanité" or "movement for welcoming the Elohim, creators of humanity". It also stands for "''M''oise ''a'' ''d''evancé ''E''lie et le ''Ch''rist" meaning "[[Moses]] preceded [[Elijah]] and the [[Christ]]".  The "New Commandments" presented to him on that Tuesday concerned the establishment of Geniocracy, Economic Humanitarianism, World Government, and his mission to catalyze these endeavors and to hasten the return of the Elohim<ref name="Elohim">[[Angels]] or [[Fallen angels]] in Christianity and [[Jinn]] ([[Genie]]s) in Islam.</ref> to [[Earth]].<ref name="Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 104.">Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 104.</ref>

In [[September 19]], [[1974]], Claude Vorilhon held his first public conference Paris, [[France]] which attracted more than 2000 people.<ref name="Rael: Messenger of the Elohim">[http://rael.org/rael_content/rael_bio.php?prophet Rael: Messenger of the Elohim], ''The International Raelian Movement''. Retrieved [[1 December]] [[2006]].</ref>  Soon after, Rael founded and began to establish MADECH.<ref name="Rael: Messenger of the Elohim"/>  In [[December 13]], this was brought into fruition as 170 MADECH members gathered at Puy de Lassolas and formed an organization of "a president, a treasurer, and a secretary" who each signed a 10,000 [[franc]] check payable towards the publication of the first Raëlian book.<ref name="Palmer, p. 37.">Palmer, p. 37.</ref>

[[Susan J. Palmer]] commented that in ''UFO platform societies'' like the MADECH organization, there was no obligation of membership and commitment like those found in cults, but rather an open place where people could freely exchange their views and relate their experiences on the subject of UFOs.  Only the first Raëlian book had surfaced at the time, and Palmer says it had comprised largely of a "creation myth and eschatology" but it had "no rituals, no priesthood, no experiential dimension, and no coherent system of ethics" which would lead to an organized movement that had any chance of committing to large projects guided by a leader.<ref name="Palmer, p. 57.">Palmer, p. 57.</ref>

At the [[:fr:Place de la République|Place de la République]] in [[March 1975]], Claude Vorhilon staged a purging of leaders which hampered his own creativity.<ref name="Palmer, p. 38.">Palmer, p. 38.</ref> In the following month, Claude Vorhilon called for a meeting of the MADECH organization, which held its headquarters in [[Paris]], and as its president, he conducted it with the intention to rid the organization from the kind of occultism and [[pseudoscience]] which contradicted his [[physicalism|physicalist]] point of view.<ref name="Palmer, p. 37.">Palmer, p. 37.</ref> In addition to this, the MADECH officials had an increasing desire to blend in with the rest of the [[ufologists]] and [[trekkies]] and were becoming less interested in the Raëlian view of [[Elohim]] extraterrestrials.  A schism was becoming more apparent among the officials, and subsequently Vorilhon dismissed all of them.  Their positions were replaced by an inner circle of seven people whose mission was to inform the public of the Raëlian messages and to raise funds for building an [[Raëlian embassy for extraterrestrials|embassy for extraterrestrials]].<ref name="Palmer, p. 37.">Palmer, p. 37.</ref>  Vorilhon says he resigned as president of MADECH by that June, because it seemed to him that MADECH could survive on its own and that he had made a mistake by structuring it into a form that he likened to a "petanque club or a war veterans' association."  Then he speaks of a personal desire to settle in the countryside and write an autobiography of events happening prior to his purported extraterrestrial encounters beginning in [[December 13]], [[1973]].<ref name="Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 142-143.">Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 142-143.</ref>

===Sightings===
In his book ''Intelligent Design'', Raël claims the following events occurred.  In [[July 31]], [[1975]], along with his wife Marie-Paul and a devoted MADECH member, François, Raël sights a UFO near his new home in the countryside near [[Clermont-Ferrand]],<ref name="Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 142-143.">Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 142-143.</ref> the town he previously had lived in.<ref name="Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 135.">Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 135.</ref>  The glowing craft performed aerial start-and-go maneuvers along a zigzag path.  Raël thought that this was a verification that the new location that he and his wife were now living in was the right place and time.<ref name="Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 142-143.">Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 142-143.</ref>

He said that in [[October 7]], [[1975]], an hour before midnight,<ref name="GMT+1"/> after having a sudden urge to observe the night sky, he decided to go to Roc Plat, an uninhabited place between two brooks surround by a forest. According to him a spacecraft suddenly landed and shone a bright light behind a bush.  He said he then met the same extraterrestrial from his first encounter in [[December 13]], [[1973]]. He said after a few words, he was taken up in that spacecraft with the Eloha and sent to a remote base relatively close to the solar system where he was given a resort-style relaxation treatment.<ref name="Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 145-148.">Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 145-148.</ref>

He said that on the morning of [[October 8]], received a lecture from Yahweh Elohim about his current achievement towards the foundation of MADECH, the need for [[geniocracy]], Buddhism, and about the ideas of God and Soul, and later traveled to the Planet of the Eternals.  He said the planet orbited around a very large star and had a climate similar to the rain forests of Earth. He later claimed to have sat down with the Eloha and had a meal with the major prophets including Buddha, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed. He said that a guide showed him installations which houses machines for creating biological robots. He gave a picture of his mother to a machine which he claimed created similarly-appearing biological robot.  He said that in the night, he received an introduction to bedroom his future home at the Planet of the Eternals and was presented young, mature female biological robots. He said that before reaching a climax, he wore a helmet which plays music controlled by his thoughts which the females danced to. Then the climax happens.<ref name="Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 148-171.">Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 148-171.</ref>

He said that on the morning of [[October 9]], he took a scented bath and that soon after, Yahweh Elohim (an extraterrestrial) presented Claude Vorilhon to a machine which maximized his faculties. Yahweh Elohim then gave advice to him, the one who has become Claude Raël.  Claude Raël then spent a few more hours and enjoyed what that world had to offer while he was there, including meeting with the past messengers of the Elohim.<ref name="Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 171-178.">Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 171-178.</ref>  By midnight of [[October 10]] (Julian Date 2442695),<ref name="GMT+1"/> 666 days after the first meeting with the Elohim and minutes after the last one, Claude Raël is back on Roc Plat.<ref name="Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 178.">Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 178.</ref>

He said that in the afternoon of [[October 7]], [[1976]], at ''la Negrerie'' of [[France]], fifty [[Raëlians]] witnessed cotton-like substances falling from the sky<ref name="Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 356-7.">Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 356-7.</ref> which Rael said has a historical relationship to [[manna]].<ref name="Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 28.">Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 28.</ref> Rael said that [[manna]] was a pulverized synthetic chemical food made by the Elohim, and that it was sent to Israelites on the ground in similar manner during their journey through an artificial passage in [[Red Sea]] formed by a repulsion beam.<ref name="Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 28.">Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 28.</ref>

===Geniocratic movement===
In 1978, Raëlians had a conference for the French press announcing their vision for a worldwide political movement for [[Geniocracy]].  In [[March 1978]], one their members was voted onto the city council of [[Sarlat]].  However, in the previous December, the authoritarian nature of the [[Geniocracy|Geniocratic]] model of government, the Raëlians being a sect, and the swastika in their logo prompted the police to seize documents in Raël's home as well as the homes of other Raëlians.<ref name="Palmer, p. 86.">Palmer, p. 86.</ref>

From 1980 to 1992, the Raël and his movement became increasingly global. Beginning from 1980, Claude Raël's fifth [[Raelian]] book ''[[Sensual Meditation]]'' was published for the first time and formal publication of the Raelian Messages in the Japanese language began<ref>[http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ja&u=http://webmarch.net/~jrm/ Harmony Revolution], ''Japanese Raelian Movement''.

At sundown in 1986, in a restaurant next to Villa Pamphilli park—just outside [[Vatican City]]—Raël began claiming to members that he was the true pope and played a guitar hymn about extraterrestrials.<ref name="Palmer, p. 91.">Palmer, p. 91.</ref>  In 1990, Australians became the next Raëlian target,<ref name="Palmer, p. 64.">Palmer, p. 64.</ref> and in 1992, Canada's Raëlians purchased 115 hectares near [[Valcourt, Quebec|Valcourt]], [[Quebec]] for a series of summer seminars in North America, and their leader gave it the name "Le Jardin du Prophète" (The Prophet's Gardens).<ref name="Palmer, p. 61.">Palmer, p. 61.</ref>

===First wave of sexual advocacy===
Quebec remained as the epicenter for Raelian campaigns and testing of experimental ideas.<ref name="Palmer, p. 64.">Palmer, p. 64.</ref> In [[December 1992]], a project—Operation Condom—was launched in response to a veto of the Montreal Catholic School Commission against the installation of high school condom vending machines.  A mobile condom vendor—a pink van dubbed the "condom-mobile"—was orchestrated by a Raëlian transexual.  The transexual advocated the notion that extraterrestrial [[Elohim]] wanted the teens to live a long life of [[pleasure]] and criticized the commission by quoting statistics about [[teen pregnancy|teen pregnancies]] and [[sexually transmitted diseases]].<ref name="Lewis, p. 375.">Lewis, p. 375.</ref>  About 10,000 condoms were distributed.<ref name="SusanJPalmer">Susan J.

In [[Montreal]] [[July 7]], [[1993]], a conference about [[masturbation]] entitled "Yes to Self-Love" was hosted by [[Betty Dodson]], [[Raël]], and a Raëlian bishop.<ref name="Palmer, p. 69.">Palmer, p. 69.</ref>  Betty Dodson, who came to Montreal the previous month,<ref name="Clitoraid America">[http://raelianews.org/download.php?view.152 Clitoraid America], ''Raelian Contact 316''.

===Raël's return to racing===
In 1994, rich Japanese Raëlians rented a race car and showed it to [[Claude Vorilhon]].  They believed that it would generate publicity for the movement.  Claude accepted the offer on the condition that the funding must not come from member tithes or embassy funding.  So the funding of Raël's races which took place in the 1990s and early 2000s came mostly from well funded European and Japanese people.<ref name="Susan J.

===Calls for religious and tax-exempt status===
In [[October 7]], [[1994]], Raëlians began implementing their own version of baptism in front of a baptismal font inside [[St. Peter's Basilica]], however, in response to Catholics' complaints, Vatican guards escorted the Raëlians to the exit gates of the city.  In the same week, Raël purportedly handed a copy of his book ''Le Livre qui dit la vérité'' to [[Pope John Paul II]].<ref name="Palmer, p. 91.">Palmer, p. 91.</ref>

In [[March 1995]], the Raëlians attained [[religious corporation|religious-corporation]] status in Quebec and was therefore eligible to apply for federal tax exemption in Canada.  However the tax department refused the application since according to them, they did not meet the requirement of religions which believe in transcendental and immaterial beings.  Raëlians made an appeal which did not go through.  However, in the United States, the Raëlians' attempt to achieve tax-exempt status was a success.<ref name="Palmer, p. 66.">Palmer, p. 66.</ref>

[[Image:Raëlians at UFOland.jpg|thumb|left|Raëlians at UFOland]]
==Recent years==
===Museum for the paranormal===
In [[August 1997]], ''UFOland''—built by the Raëlians as the largest structure in North America made out of bales of hay—opened on their Valcourt estate.  Its purpose was to inform the public about the Raëlian interpretation about the UFO phenomenon and to attract funds for the ''[[Raelian Foundation]]''. The first room served as an attraction for their proposed [[Raëlian embassy for extraterrestrials]].  Audio visual presentations in six other rooms displayed teachings about the Raëlian message, sightings, and government cover-ups concerning UFOs.  In 2001, ''UFOland'' was closed to the public.  The reason given by the director for ''UFOland'' was that the revenue did not justify the costs—including two hour trips from Montreal.<ref name="Palmer, p. 65.">Palmer, p. 65.</ref>

===Anti-clerical campaigns===
In [[July 2001]], Raëlians on the streets attracted Italians and Swiss people as they gave leaflets in protest to over a hundred child molesters in existence among Roman Catholic clergy in France.  They recommended that parents should not send their children to Catholic confession.  The Episcopal [[vicar]] of Geneva sued the Raëlian Church for libel but did not win.<ref name="The bishops react to the attacks anti-catholics of the Raëlian movement (translated)">[http://www.kath.ch/infosekten/text_detail.php?nemeid=6390 The bishops react to the attacks anti-catholics of the Raëlian movement (translated)], ''Infosekten''.

In [[October 2002]], Raëlians in a Canadian anti-clerical parade held handed out Christian crosses to high school students.  They were invited to burn the crosses in a park not far from Montreal's [[Mount Royal]] and to sign letters of apostasy from the Roman Catholic Church.  The Quebec Association of Bishops called this "incitement to hatred", and several school boards attempted to prevent their students from meeting Raëlians.<ref name="Palmer, p. 92.">Palmer, p. 92.</ref>

===Advocacy===
In [[December 26]], [[2002]], [[Brigitte Boisselier]], a Raëlian Bishop and CEO of a biotechnology company called Clonaid, announced the birth of baby Eve, a human clone, which at that point ignited much media attention, ethical debate, doubt, critics, and claims of a hoax.  Spokespeople for the movement, such as Claude Vorilhon, have suggested that this is only first step in achieving a more important agenda, saying that that accelerated growth process and [[mind transfer]],  in combination with [[cloning]] are mechanisms by which [[eternal life]] may be achieved.<ref name="THE CLONING DEBATE">[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/science/july-dec02/cloning_12-27.html THE CLONING DEBATE], ''MacNeil/Lehrer Productions''.

According to the ''[[Japan Today]]'' of [[February 10]], [[2003]], that Sunday, about sixty Raëlians celebrated with banners the purported birth of the first cloned babies: 1) a baby girl named Eve, 2) a daughter and clone of a Dutch lesbian, 3) a son and clone of a Japanese male.  The small parade event began at [[Hiroshima Station]] and ended at [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park]].  In the article, figures by the observers and a representative of the movement suggest that one percent of [[Japan]]'s Raëlians participated in the event.<ref name="Japan's Raelians hold parade to celebrate human clone births">[http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=12216&sec=42&cont=4 Japan's Raelians hold parade to celebrate human clone births], ''Worldwide Religious News, Japan Today''.

In 2006, Raëlian Movement vocally advocated of the concept of a "United States of Africa" following a more honest and complete ''decolonization'' that would involve the disbanding of corrupt rulerships as a result of Africans returning to their non-Christian ancestors' religious and territorial roots, which existed before colonization by Europeans.<ref name="AFRICA, THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY">[http://raelafrica.org/e107v2/download.php?view.1 AFRICA, THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY], ''The International Raelian Movement''.
