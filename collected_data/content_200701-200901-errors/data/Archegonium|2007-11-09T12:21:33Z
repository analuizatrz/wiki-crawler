An '''archegonium''' (pl: '''archegonia'''), from the [[ancient Greek]] ''αρχη'' (beginning) and ''γονος'' (offspring), is a multicellular structure or organ of the [[gametophyte]] phase of certain [[plant]]s producing and containing the [[ovum]] or female [[gamete]]. The archegonium has a long neck and a swollen base. Archegonia are typically located on the surface of the plant [[thallus (tissue)|thallus]], although in the [[Hornwort|horned liverworts]] they are embedded. 

They are also much-reduced and embedded in the megagametophytes of [[gymnosperm]]s. The term is not used for [[angiosperm]]s or the gnetophytes ''[[Gnetum]]'' and ''[[Welwitschia]]'' because the megagametophyte is reduced to just a few cells, one of which differentiates into the egg cell. The function of surrounding the gamete is assumed in large part by [[diploid]] cells of the [[megasporangium]] ([[nucellus]]) inside the [[ovule]].

The corresponding male organ is called the [[antheridium]].
