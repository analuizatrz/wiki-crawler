'''Vermont''' ({{Audio-IPA|en-us-Vermont.ogg|/vərˈmɒnt/}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[New England]] region of the [[Northeastern United States|northeastern]] [[United States|United States of America]]. The state ranks 45th by total area and 43rd by land area at {{convert|9250|sqmi|km2}}.  It has a population of 608,827, ranking 49th of all fifty states (surpassing only [[Wyoming]]). The only New England state with no coastline along the Atlantic Ocean, Vermont is notable for the [[Green Mountains]] running north to south and [[Lake Champlain]] which makes up 50% of Vermont's western border. It is bordered by [[Massachusetts]] to the south, [[New Hampshire]] to the east, [[New York]] to the west, and the Canadian province of [[Quebec]] to the north.

Originally inhabited by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes ([[Abenaki]], <!---Abenaki are Algonquians[[Algonquian]],---->and [[Iroquois]]), the territory that is now Vermont was claimed by [[France]] but became a British possession after France's defeat in the [[French and Indian War]]. For many years, the surrounding [[thirteen Colonies|colonies]] disputed control of the area, especially New Hampshire and New York. Settlers who held land titles granted by these colonies were opposed by the [[Green Mountain Boys]] militia, which eventually prevailed in creating an independent state, the [[Vermont Republic]], which was founded during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and lasted for 14 years. In 1791, Vermont joined the United States as the fourteenth state.

The state is noted for its scenery and [[dairy]] products. It is the leading producer of [[maple syrup]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web | title=US Department of Agriculture - Economic Research Service|work='Table 44&mdash;U.S. maple syrup production and value, by state, calendar years |url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/briefing/sugar/data/table44.xls|accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref> The state capital is [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]], and the largest city and metropolitan area is [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]].

== Geography ==
{{see also|List of counties in Vermont|List of Vermont county seats|List of towns in Vermont|List of mountains in Vermont}}

Vermont is located in the New England region in the eastern United States, and comprises 9,614 square miles (24,902&nbsp;km²), making it the 45th largest state. Of this, land comprises 9,250 square miles (23,955&nbsp;km²) and water comprises 365 square miles (948&nbsp;km²), making it the 43rd largest in land area and the 47th in water area. In area, it is larger than [[El Salvador]] and smaller than [[Haiti]].

[[Image:National-atlas-vermont.png|thumb|300px|Map of Vermont, showing cities, roads and rivers]]
The west bank of the [[Connecticut River]] marks the eastern border of the state with New Hampshire (the river itself is part of New Hampshire).<ref>{{Findlaw us|289|593|Vermont v. New Hampshire|link=article|year=1933}}</ref> [[Lake Champlain]], the major lake in Vermont, is the sixth-largest body of fresh water in the United States and separates Vermont from New York in the northwest portion of the state. From north to south, Vermont is 159 miles (256&nbsp;km). Its greatest width, from east to west, is 89 miles (143&nbsp;km) at the Canadian border; the narrowest width is 37 miles (60&nbsp;km) at the Massachusetts line. The state's [[geographic center]] is [[Washington, Vermont|Washington]], three miles (5&nbsp;km) east of [[Roxbury, Vermont|Roxbury]].

There are six distinct physiographic regions of Vermont. Categorized by geological and physical attributes, they are the Northeastern Highlands, the Green Mountains, the Taconic Mountains, the Champlain Lowlands, the Valley of Vermont and the Vermont Piedmont.<ref>{{cite web | title=Academics Content Server at Saint Michael's |work=The Physiographic Regions of Vermont | url=http://academics.smcvt.edu/vtgeographic/textbook/physiographic/physiographic_regions_of_vermont.htm | accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref>

The origin of the name Green Mountains ({{lang-fr|Les verts monts}}) is uncertain. Some authorities say that they are so named because they have much more [[forestation]] than the higher White Mountains of New Hampshire and Adirondacks of New York. Other authorities say that they are so named because of the predominance of [[mica]]-[[quartz]]-[[chlorite]] [[schist]], a green-hued metamorphosed shale. The Green Mountain range forms a north-south spine running most of the length of the state, slightly west of its center. In the southwest portion of the state are the [[Taconic Mountains]]; the Granitic Mountains are in the northeast.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=8NWPJkRK-VMC&pg=RA1-PA274-IA1&lpg=RA1-PA274-IA1&dq=%22granitic+mountains%22+vermont&source=web&ots=pp2RZdKv3o&sig=qEAMGLyzP3I5tkFmW5uxGHqPj5o#PRA1-PA272,M1 Google Books]</ref> In the northwest near Lake Champlain is the fertile [[Champlain Valley]]. In the south of the valley is [[Bomoseen Lake|Lake Bomoseen]].

[[Image:Vermont.png|200px|thumb|left|Vermont has 14 counties. Only two&mdash;[[Lamoille County, Vermont|Lamoille]] and [[Washington County, Vermont|Washington]]&mdash;are entirely surrounded by Vermont territory.]]
Several mountains have timberlines with delicate year round alpine ecosystems. These include [[Mount Mansfield]], the highest mountain in the state, [[Killington Peak]], the second highest, and [[Camel's Hump (Vermont)|Camels Hump]] the state's third highest. About 77 percent of the state is covered by forest; the rest is covered in meadow, uplands, lakes, ponds and swampy wetlands.

Areas in Vermont administered by the [[National Park Service]] include the [[Appalachian Trail by state#Vermont|Appalachian National Scenic Trail]], and the [[Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park]] in [[Woodstock, Vermont|Woodstock]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Vermont | publisher = National Park Service | accessdate = 2008-07-15 | url = http://www.nps.gov/state/vt}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
Vermont has a continental moist climate, with warm, humid summers and cold winters, which become colder at higher elevations.<ref>http://academics.smcvt.edu/vtgeographic/textbook/weather/weather_and_climate_of_vermont.htm accessed [[September 15]], [[2007]]</ref> It has a [[Koppen climate classification]] of Dfb, similar to Minsk, Stockholm and Fargo.<ref>http://vermont.wedding.net/geography.html accessed [[September 15]], [[2007]]</ref> Vermont is known for its [[mud season]] in spring followed by a generally mild early summer, hot Augusts and a colorful autumn, and particularly for its cold winters. The northern part of the state, including the rural northeastern section (dubbed the "[[Northeast Kingdom]]") is known for exceptionally cold winters, often averaging 10 °F (5.56 °C) colder than the southern areas of the state. Annual [[snow]]fall averages between {{convert|60|in|cm|0}} to {{convert|100|in|cm|0}} depending on elevation, resulting in a number of cross-country and downhill [[List of ski areas and resorts in the United States#Vermont|ski areas]]. The annual mean temperature for the state is {{convert|43|°F|°C|0}}.<ref>[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/VAN_VIR/VERMONT.html Vermont Online Encyclopedia] retrieved [[May 28]], [[2008]]</ref>

In the autumn, Vermont's hills display red, orange and gold foliage displayed on the [[sugar maple]] as cold weather approaches. This display of color is not due so much to the presence of a particular variant of the sugar maple; rather it is caused by a number of soil and climate conditions unique to the area.

The highest-recorded temperature was 105&nbsp;°F (41&nbsp;°C), at [[Vernon, Vermont|Vernon]] on [[July 4]], [[1911]]; the lowest-recorded temperature was -50&nbsp;°F (-46&nbsp;°C), at [[Bloomfield, Vermont|Bloomfield]] on [[December 30]], [[1933]].

{{main|History of Vermont}}

[[Image:Mount mansfield 20040926.jpg|280px|thumb|right|[[Mount Mansfield]], at 4,393 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (1,339&nbsp;[[metre|m]]), is the highest point in Vermont.]]
===Pre-Columbian===
Between 8500 to 7000 BC, at the time of the Champlain Sea, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] inhabited and hunted in Vermont. During the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]], from the 8th millennium BC to 1000 BC, Native Americans migrated year-round. During the [[Woodland period]], from 1000 BC to AD 1600, villages and trade networks were established, and ceramic and [[Bow (weapon)|bow and arrow]] technology was developed. In [[pre-Columbian]] Vermont, the western part of the state was originally home to a small population of [[Algonquian]]-speaking tribes, including the [[Mahican|Mohican]] and [[Abenaki]] peoples. Sometime between 1500 and 1600, the [[Iroquois]] drove many of the smaller native tribes out of Vermont, later using the area as a [[hunting]] ground and warring with the remaining Abenaki. The population in 1500 was estimated to be around 10,000 people.

=== Colonial ===
{{seealso|List of forts in Vermont}}
[[Image:ConstitutionHouse WindsorVermont.JPG|280px|right|thumb|The [[Old Constitution House]] at [[Windsor, Vermont|Windsor]], where the [[Constitution of the Vermont Republic|Constitution of Vermont]] was adopted on [[July 8]], [[1777]].]]

The first [[Europe]]an to see Vermont is thought to have been [[Jacques Cartier]], in 1535. On [[July 30]], [[1609]], [[French colonization of the Americas|French explorer]] [[Samuel de Champlain]] claimed Vermont as part of [[New France]], and erected a fort which was the first European settlement in Vermont.

In 1690, a group of [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-British settlers from [[Albany, New York|Albany]] established a settlement and trading post at [[Chimney Point, Vermont|Chimney Point]] {{convert|8|mi}} west of present-day [[Addison, Vermont|Addison]]). 

The first permanent British settlement was established in 1724, with the construction of [[Fort Dummer]] protecting the nearby settlements of [[Dummerston, Vermont|Dummerston]] and [[Brattleboro (town), Vermont|Brattleboro]]. 

From 1731-4, the French constructed a fort which gave the French control of the New France/Vermont border region in the Lake Champlain Valley.

The British failed to take the Fort St. Frédéric four times between 1755 and 1758. In 1759, a combined force of 12,000 British regular and provincial troops under Sir [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]] captured the fort. The French were driven out of the area.

Following France's loss in the [[French and Indian War]], the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|1763 Treaty of Paris]] gave control of the land to the British.

The end of the war brought new settlers to Vermont. Ultimately, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and New York all contended for this frontier area.

On [[1764-07-20]], [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] established the boundary between [[New Hampshire]] and [[New York]] along the west bank of the [[Connecticut River]], north of [[Massachusetts]], and south of the parallel of ''45 Degrees north latitude''. When [[New York]] refused to recognize land titles through the New Hampshire Grants (towns created earlier by [[New Hampshire]] in present Vermont), dissatisfied colonists organized in opposition, which led to the creation of independent Vermont on [[1777-01-18]].<ref name="SLADE">[[William Slade|Slade, William, Jr.]], Compiler. ''Vermont State Papers: Being a Collection of Records and Documents Connected with the Assumption and Establishment of Government by the People of Vermont, Together with the Journal of the Council of Safety, the First Constitution, the Early Journals of the General Assembly, and the Laws from the Year 1779 to 1786, Inclusive.''; [[Middlebury, Vermont]]; 1823.

In 1770, [[Ethan Allen]], his brothers [[Ira Allen|Ira]] and Levi, and Seth Warner recruited an informal militia, the [[Green Mountain Boys]], to protect the interests of the original New Hampshire settlers against the new migrants from New York.

=== Independence and statehood ===

{{main|Vermont Republic}}

On [[January 18]], [[1777]], representatives of the New Hampshire Grants declared the independence of the [[Vermont Republic|Vermont]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Second Vermont Republic|work=Vermont's Declaration of Independence (1777)  | url=http://www.vermontrepublic.org/vermonts_declaration_of_independence_1777 | accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref> For the first six months of the state's existence, the state was called [[New Connecticut]].<ref name="autogenerated1">Esther Munroe Swift, ''Vermont Place-Names: Footprints in History'' Picton Press, 1977</ref>

On [[June 2]], [[1777]], a second convention of 72 delegates met to adopt the name "Vermont." This was on the advice of a friendly Pennsylvanian who wrote them on how to achieve admission into the newly independent United States as the 14th state.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> On [[July 4]], the [[Constitution of the Vermont Republic|Constitution of Vermont]] was drafted at the [[Old Constitution House|Windsor Tavern]] adopted by the delegates on [[July 8]]. This was among the first written constitutions in [[North America]] and was indisputably the first to abolish the institution of slavery, provide for universal manhood suffrage and require support of public schools.

===Revolutionary War===
{{main|Battle of Bennington}}
The Battle of Bennington, fought on [[August 16]], [[1777]], was a seminal event in the history of the state of Vermont. It achieved statehood as the 14th state in the union in 1791.

A combined American forces, under General Stark's command, attacked the British column at [[Hoosick, New York]], just across the border from Bennington and killed or captured virtually the entire British detachment. General Burgoyne never recovered from this loss and eventually surrendered the remainder of his 6,000-man force at [[Saratoga, New York]], on [[October 17]].

Battles of [[Battle of Bennington|Bennington]] and [[Battle of Saratoga|Saratoga]] are recognized as the turning point in the Revolutionary War because they were the first major defeat of a British army. The anniversary of the battle is still celebrated in Vermont as a legal holiday .

===Statehood and the ante-bellum era===
Vermont continued to govern itself as a sovereign entity based in the eastern town of Windsor for fourteen years. The independent state of Vermont issued its own coinage from [[1785]]-[[1788]]<ref>Margaret Bucholt [http://www.manchestervermont.net/about.php Manchester and the Mountains Chamber of Commerce] ''An Insider's Guide to Southern Vermont'', Penguin, 1991</ref> and operated a statewide postal service. [[Thomas Chittenden]] was governor from 1778-1789 and 1790-1791. The state exchanged ambassadors with France, the Netherlands, and the American government then at Philadelphia. In 1791, Vermont joined the federal Union as the fourteenth state&ndash;the first state to enter the union after the original thirteen colonies.

Vermont had a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature until 1836.

The mid to late 1850s saw a transition from Vermonters mostly favoring slavery's containment, to a far more serious opposition to the institution, producing the [[Radical Republican (USA)|Radical Republican]] and [[abolitionist]] [[Thaddeus Stevens]]. As the Whig party shriveled, and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] emerged, Vermont strongly trended in support of its candidates. In 1860 it voted for President [[Abraham Lincoln]], giving him the largest margin of victory of any state.

=== The Civil War ===
{{main|Vermont in the American Civil War}}
During the [[American Civil War]], Vermont sent more than 34,000 men into United States service. Almost 5,200 Vermonters, 15%, were killed or mortally wounded in action or died of disease. 

The northernmost land action of the war, the [[St. Albans Raid]], took place in Vermont.

===Postbellum era and beyond===
The first election in which women were allowed to vote was on [[December 18]], [[1880]], when women were granted limited [[suffrage]] and were first allowed to vote in town elections, and then in state legislative races.

Large-scale [[flooding]] occurred in early November 1927. During this incident, 85 people died, 84 of them in Vermont. Another flood occurred in 1973, when the flood caused the death of two people and millions of dollars in property damage.

In 1964, the [[US Supreme Court]] forced “one-man, one-vote” redistricting on Vermont, giving cities an equitable share of votes in both houses for the entire country.<ref>{{cite web | title=Arizona State Library | work=One Man, One Vote" ... That's All She Wrote!
 | url=http://www.library.arizona.edu/exhibits/udall/congrept/88th/641014.html | accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref> Until that time, counties were often represented by area in state senates and were often unsympathetic to urban problems requiring increased taxes.

According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], as of 2005, Vermont has an estimated population of 623,050, which is an increase of 1,817, or 0.3%, from the prior year and an increase of 14,223, or 2.3%, since the year 2000. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 7,148 people (that is 33,606 births minus 26,458 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 7,889 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 4,359 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 3,530 people.

It is the least populous state in New England.

Residents of British ancestry (especially English) live throughout most of Vermont. The northern part of the state maintains a significant percentage of people of French-Canadian ancestry.

In the last two decades, the Burlington area has welcomed the resettlement of several refugee communities. These include individuals and families from South East Asia, Bosnia, Sudan, Somalia, Burundi and Tibet. These communities have grown to include non-refugees and in some cases are several generations in the making.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

According to the [[2000 U.S. Census]], 2.54% of the population aged 5 and over speak [[French language|French]] at home, while 1.00% speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [http://www.mla.org/map_data_results&state_id=50&mode=state_tops].

In colonial times, like many of its neighboring states, Vermont's largest religious affiliation was [[Congregationalism]]. In 1776, 63% of affiliated church members in Vermont were Congregationalists. At that time, however, only 9% of people belonged to a specific church due to the remoteness of population centers. The Congregational [[United Church of Christ]] remains the largest Protestant denomination and Vermont has the largest percentage of this denomination of any state.<ref>{{cite web | title=Adherents.com | work=Religion in Vermont | url=http://www.adherents.com/loc/loc_vermont.html | accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref>

Today more than two-thirds of Vermont residents identify themselves as [[Christianity|Christians]]. This number includes a body of Christian Lebanese stoneworkers.{{Fact|date=September 2008}} The largest single religious body in the state is the [[Roman Catholic Church]].  According to the [[Association of Religion Data Archives|ARDA]] the Catholic Church had 147,918 members in 2000.<ref>http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/reports/state/50_2000.asp</ref>  

Twenty-four percent of Vermonters attend church regularly. This low is matched only by New Hampshire.<ref>{{cite book | author = Sullivan, Will |title = A New Shade of Granite | publisher = US News and World Report | date = June 11, 2007}}</ref>  

Over one-fifth of Vermonters identify themselves as non-religious, tying Vermont with Oregon as having the second-highest percentage of non-religious people in the United States. Only Washington State has a higher percentage.{{Fact|date=May 2008}} A survey suggests that people in Vermont and New Hampshire<ref> which were polled jointly,</ref> are less likely to attend weekly services and are less likely to believe in God (54%) than people in the rest of the nation (71%). The two states are at the lowest levels among states in religious commitment. About 23% percent of the respondents attend religious service at least once a week (39% nationally). Thirty-six percent said religion is very important to them (56% nationally).<ref>[http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080713/NEWS01/80712015] retrieved July 29, 2008</ref>

Almost one-third of Vermonters are self-identified [[Protestantism|Protestants]]. The largest Protestant denomination in the state is the [[United Church of Christ]] with 21,597, and the second largest is the [[United Methodist Church]] with 19,000 members;<ref>http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/reports/state/50_2000.asp</ref> followed by [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalians]], "other" Christians, and [[American Baptist Churches|Baptists]].

[[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] and [[Brigham Young]]&mdash;the first two leaders of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]&mdash;were both born in Vermont. Adherents to the Mormon faith, however, do not make up a single percentage point of Vermont's population. A memorial to Joseph Smith, at his birthplace in Sharon, is maintained by the LDS. 

The state has 5,000 people of [[Jew]]ish faith - 3,000 in Burlington and 500 each in Montpelier-Barre and Rutland&mdash;and four [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and two [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] congregations.<ref>2001 ''Shengold Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref>  

Vermont may have the highest concentration of western-convert [[Buddhists]] in the country. It is home to several Buddhist retreat centers.<ref>http://www.boston.com/news/local/vermont/articles/2005/02/23/green_mountains_good_karma/ Buddhist retreat centers</ref>

Other religions include [[Quakers|The Society of Friends]], [[Shinto]], [[Wicca]], [[Islam]], and [[Paganism]].{{Fact|date=July 2008}}<!---this sentence should be deleted, not because these religions don't exist in Vt, but because they haven't been enumerated by a scholarly source.

== Economy ==
In 2007, Vermont was ranked 32nd among states in which to do business.

===Agriculture===

Over the past two centuries logging has fallen off as over-cutting and the exploitation of other forests made Vermont's forest less attractive. Loss of farms has had the beneficial effect of allowing Vermont's land and forest to recover. The accompanying lack of industry has allowed Vermont to avoid many of the ill-effects of 20th century industrial busts, effects that still plague neighboring states. Today, most of Vermont's forests consist of second-growth.

Of the remaining industries, [[dairy farming]] is the primary source of agricultural income.

In the last half of the twentienth century, developers have had plans to build [[Condominium (housing)|condos]] and houses on what was relatively inexpensive, open land. Vermont's government has responded with a series of laws controlling development and with some pioneering initiatives to prevent the loss of Vermont's dairy industry.

In 1947 there were 11,206 dairy farms in the state. In 2003 there were fewer than 1,500, a decline of 80%. The number of cattle had declined by 40%. However, milk production had doubled in the same period due to tripling the production per cow.<ref>[http://www.vermontdairy.com/dairy_industry/farms/numbers Dairy Farm Numbers - Vermont Dairy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2007, there were 1,087 farms left, down from 1,138 in 2006. While milk production rose, Vermont's market share declined. Within a group of states supplying the Boston-NYC market,<ref>called "federal order one"</ref> Vermont was third with a 10.6% share of the market.<ref>New York has 44.9%, Pennsylvania has 32.9%</ref><ref>{{cite book | author = Dunbar, Bethany |title = Vermont Milk Commission takes a look at hauling costs | publisher = the Chronicle | date = November 14, 2007}}</ref> in 2007, there were 1,050 dairy farms remaining. The number has been diminishing by 10% annually.<ref>{{cite book | author = Dunbar, Bethany M. |title = Vermont Milk Commission considers price premium | publisher = the Chronicle | date = September 10, 2008}}</ref>

A significant amount of milk is shipped into the Boston market. Therefore the Commonwealth of Massachusetts certifies that Vermont farms meet Massachusetts sanitary standards. Without this certification, a farmer may not sell milk for distribution into the bulk market.<ref>[http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/627/627.F2d.606.79-7759.79-7113.1070.1098.html LeClair vs Saunders] retrieved [[April 21]], [[1980]]</ref>

An important and growing part of Vermont's economy is the manufacture and sale of artisan foods, fancy foods, and novelty items trading in part upon the Vermont "brand" which the state 
<!---Is is trademarked? Is there a citation/footnote that can be used? ---->
manages and defends. Examples of these specialty exports include [[Cabot Cheese]], the [[Vermont Teddy Bear Company]], [[Fine Paints of Europe]], Vermont Butter and Cheese Company, several [[Vermont beer and breweries|micro breweries]], ginseng growers, [[Burton Snowboards]], [[Lake Champlain Chocolates]], [[King Arthur Flour]], and [[Ben & Jerry's|Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream]]. 

In 2001, Vermont produced 275,000 US gallons (1,040,000 L) of maple syrup, about one-quarter of U.S. production. For 2005 that number was 410,000 accounting for 37% of national production.<ref>((cite web |  author = Vermont Maple Sugar Makers Assoc. | title=Maple Facts |url=http://www.vermontmaple.org/maplefacts.html | access date = 2007-04-08))</ref> 

In 2000, only 3% of the state's working population was still engaged in agriculture.<ref>{{cite book | author = Liz Halloran | title = Vermont's War | publisher = US News and World Report, [[January 22]], page 45 | year = 2007}}</ref>

Wine industry started in Vermont in 1985. There are 14 wineries today.<ref>{{cite book | author = Curran, John |title = Winemakers hope new state council will help them grow | publisher = Burlington Free Press | date = July 29, 2007}}</ref>

===Manufacturing===
[[IBM]], in Essex Junction, is Vermont's largest for-profit employer. It provides 25% of all manufacturing jobs in Vermont. In 2007 it employed 6,800 workers.<ref>[http://www.acinet.org/oview6.asp?soccode=&stfips=50&from=State&id=11&nodeid=12 America's Career Infonet]accessed [[February 3]], [[2008]]</ref> It is responsible for $1 billion of the state's annual economy.<ref>''The Burlington Free Press'', [[February 28]], [[2007]], page 8C, "IBM:Enriching economy for 50 years."</ref>

===Health===
An increasingly aging population is expected to improve this industry's position in the state economy. In 2008, [[Fletcher Allen Health Care]] was the second highest employer of people in the state.<ref>{{cite book | author = McLean, Dan |title = IBM won't be No. 1 employer for much longer | publisher = Burlington Free Press | date = June 29, 2008}}</ref> 
===Housing===
In 2007 Vermont was the 17th highest state in the nation for mortgage affordability. However, in 41 other states, inhabitants contributed within plus or minus 4% of Vermont's 18.4% of household income to a mortgage.<ref>{{cite web | title=Vermont Business Roundtable|work=Housing Prices, Availability, and Affordability in Vermont  | url=http://www.vtroundtable.org/Portals/0/housingreport.pdf | accessdate=2007-01-07|format=PDF}}</ref>

Housing prices did not rise that much during the early 2000s. As a result, the collapse in real estate values was not that precipitous either. While foreclosure rose significantly in 2007, the state stood 50th (last,best) in ratio of foreclosure filings to households.<ref>{{cite book | author = Braithwaite, Chris |title = Vermont weathers mortgage storm | publisher = the Chronicle | date = December 19, 2007}}</ref> While housing sales dropped annually from 2004 to 2008, prices continued to rise.<ref>{{cite book | author = Ryan, Matt |title = Moving In: Essex home prices edge higher | publisher = Burlington Free Press | date = August 3, 2008}}</ref>

In 2007, Vermont was best in the country for construction of new energy efficient homes as evaluated by the [[EPA]] under the [[Energy Star]] program.<ref>{{cite book | author = Gresser, Joseph |title = Vermont is top in N.E. for new energy efficient homes | publisher = the Chronicle | date = October 3, 2007}}</ref> However, about 60% of Vermont homes heated with oil in 2008.<ref>{{cite book | author = Pollak, Sally |title = In from the cold | publisher = Burlington Free Press | date = September 14, 2008}}</ref> In August 2008, the cost in Vermont of various heating sources per 1 million BTU ranged from $14.39 for cord wood to $43.50 for kerosene.

===Labor===
As of 2006, there were 305,000 workers in Vermont. 11% of these are unionized.<ref>[http://www.empirecenter.org/2007/01/unions_shrink_e.php Unions Shrink Even in NY, Data Show<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>A separate study shows over 325,000 workers in [[2000]] !http://www.bishca.state.vt.us/hcadiv/Data_Reports/healthinsurmarket/SurveyVTFamilyHealth2000/DataTables126_146/128_WorkingStatewideOfferFirm.PDF</ref>

A modern high unemployment rate of 9% was reached in June 1976. A modern low of 2.2% was measured in March 2002.<ref>{{cite book | author = Hemingway, Sam |title = State heads for a major recession | publisher = Burlington Free Press | date = October 22, 2008}}</ref>

===Insurance===
[[Captive insurance]] plays an increasingly large role in Vermont's economy. With this form of alternative insurance, large corporations or industry associations form standalone insurance companies to insure their own risks, thereby substantially reducing their insurance premiums and gaining a significant measure of control over types of risks to be covered. There are also significant tax advantages to be gained from the formation and operation of captive insurance companies. According to the Insurance Information Institute, Vermont in 2004 was the world's third-largest domicile for captive insurance companies, following [[Bermuda]] and the [[Cayman Islands]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Insurance Information Institute|work=Captives & Other Risk-Financing Options  | url=http://www.iii.org/media/hottopics/insurance/test3/?table_sort_745148=2 | accessdate=2007-01-07}}</ref>

===Tourism===
Tourism is a large industry in the state. In winter, the ski resorts [[Mount Mansfield|Stowe]], [[Smugglers' Notch]], [[Killington Ski Resort]], [[Mad River Glen]], [[Sugarbush]], [[Stratton, Vermont|Stratton]], [[Jay Peak Resort|Jay Peak]], [[Okemo Mountain|Okemo]], [[Suicide Six]], [[Mount Snow]] and [[Bromley Mountain|Bromley]] host skiers from around the globe, although their largest markets are the Boston, Montreal and New York metropolitan areas. In the summer, resort towns like [[Stowe, Vermont|Stowe]], [[Manchester, Vermont|Manchester]], [[Quechee, Vermont|Quechee]], [[Wilmington, Vermont|Wilmington]] and [[Woodstock, Vermont|Woodstock]] host visitors. Resorts, hotels, restaurants, and shops, designed to attract tourists, employ people year-round.
[[Image:LakeChamplain.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Lake Champlain.]]

Summer camps contribute to Vermont's tourist economy. [[Trout]] fishing, lake fishing, and [[ice fishing]] draw outdoor enthusiasts to the state, as does the hiking on the [[Long Trail]]. In winter, nordic and backcountry skiers visit to travel the length of the state on the [[Catamount Trail]]. Several [[horse show]]s are annual events. Vermont's state parks, historic sites, museums, golf courses, and new boutique hotels with spas were designed to attract tourists.

===Quarrying===
The towns of [[Rutland (town), Vermont|Rutland]] and [[Barre (town), Vermont|Barre]] are the traditional centers of marble and granite quarrying and carving in the U.S. For many years Vermont was also the headquarters of the smallest union in the U.S., the Stonecutters Association, of about 500 members. The first marble quarry in America was on Mount Aeolus overlooking East Dorset.<ref>[http://www.virtualvermont.com/towns/dorset.html VirtualVermont.com]</ref>
Up the western side of the state runs the "Marble Valley" joining up with the "Slate Valley" that runs from just inside New York across from Chimney Point until it meets the "Granite Valley" that runs west past Barre, home of the Rock of Ages quarry, the largest granite quarry in America.
Vermont is the largest producer of slate in the country.<ref>[http://www.apartmentlinks.com/VT/Vermont.html ApartmentLinks.com]</ref>
Production of dimension stone is the greatest producer of revenues by quarrying.

===Taxes===
In 2007 Vermont stood 14th highest out of 50 states and the District of Columbia for state and local taxation, with a per capita load of $3,681. The national average was $3,447.<ref>DatabankUSA,''AARP Bulletin'', April 2007, compiled from figures from the US 
<!---Okay to change this after investigating why the rankings used different per capita tax loads. Be sure to give a footnote/reference. These are just statistics. No one is trying to rain on anyone's parade here.--->Census</ref> However, CNNMoney ranked Vermont highest in the nation based on the percentage of per capita income. The rankings showed Vermont had a per capita tax load of $5,387, 14.1% of the per capita income of $38,306.<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/pf/0704/gallery.tax_friendliest/8.html Tax-Friendly Places 2007 | 8 | CNNMoney.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Vermont collects personal [[income tax]] in a progressive structure of five different income brackets, ranging from 3.6% to 9.5%. 

Vermont's general [[sales tax]] rate is 6%, which is imposed on sales of tangible personal property, amusement charges, fabrication charges, some public utility charges and some service contracts (some towns and cities impose an additional 1% Local Option Tax). There are 46 exemptions from the tax which include medical items, food, manufacturing machinery, equipment and fuel, residential fuel and electricity, clothing, and shoes. A [[use tax]] is imposed on the buyer at the same rate as the sales tax. The buyer pays the use tax when the sellers fails to collect the sales tax or the items are purchased from a source where no tax is collected. The use tax applies to items taxable under the sales tax. [[Property tax]]es are imposed for the support of education and municipal services. 

Vermont does not assess tax on [[intangible property|intangible]] [[personal property]]. Vermont does not collect [[inheritance taxes]]; however, its [[estate tax]] is decoupled from the federal estate tax laws and therefore the state still imposes its own estate tax.

===Government finances===
Vermont is the only state in the union not to have a balanced budget requirement.<ref>[http://www.ncsl.org/programs/fiscal/balbuda.htm State Balanced Budget Requirements: Provisions and Practice<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2007, Moody's Investors Service gave its top rating of Aaa to the state.<ref>Burlington Free Press, [[February 6]], [[2007]], Business, page 7A, ''Moody's gives highest bond rating to Vermont.''</ref>

== Transportation ==
Vermont's main mode of travel is by automobile. Individual communities and counties have public transit, but their breadth of coverage is frequently limited. [[Greyhound Lines]] services a number of small towns. Two [[Amtrak]] trains serve Vermont. The [[Ethan Allen Express]] serves Rutland and Fair Haven, while the [[Vermonter]] serves [[Saint Albans]], [[Essex Junction]], [[Waterbury]], [[Montpelier]], [[Randolph]], [[White River Junction]], [[Windsor]], [[Bellows Falls]] and [[Brattleboro, Vermont|Brattleboro]].

===Electricity===
Vermont has the highest rate of nuclear generated power in the nation, 73.7%.<ref>{{cite book | author = Hemingway, Sam |title = Nukes by the numbers | publisher = Burlington Free Press | date = July 20, 2008}}</ref>
Another source says that the state gets 1/3 of its power from [[Hydro Quebec]] and 1/3 from [[Vermont Yankee]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Dunbar, Bethany M. |title = Ten candidates talk business | publisher = the Chronicle | date = October 22, 2008}}</ref><!---74% sounds like too much. 1/3 is definitely top of the head but maybe closer. We need megawattage here from qualified source--->

Vermont experts estimated that the state has the capacity to ultimately generate from 134 to 175 megawatts of electricity from hydro power.<ref>{{cite book | author = Gresser, Joseph| title = Panel considers small hydro power potential | publisher = the Chronicle | date = August 20, 2008}}</ref>

===Communication===
* Broadband coverage as of 2006<ref>[http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070208/NEWS01/702080306/1009/NEWS05 Burlington Free Press.com | Top Stories<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><!--<ref>Rural Vt. wants it's broadband,''Burlington Free Press'',February 8, 2007, page 1A</ref> -->

(Above percentages are of population, not of land area.)

Cell phone coverage in the state, generally, outside of the major metropolitan areas is weak due to interference from mountains, the attempt to serve a small rural population living in a large area rendering investment in improvements uneconomical, and environmentalists' opposition to towers.<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3675/is_200310/ai_n9323531 Cell Service in Vermont: Can't hear the tourist for the trees | Vermont Business Magazine | Find Articles at BNET.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Unicel]], focusing on rural areas, has better coverage.<ref>[http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20070105/085242.shtml Techdirt: Vermont's Muni Broadband Plan Sounds Half Right<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In summer of 2007, Verizon Wireless announced that it would purchase Unicel (Rural Cellular) in Vermont and 14 other states for $2.67 billion during the first half of 2008. Some state officials and Unicel subscribers have opposed this purchase.<ref>[http://www.saveunicel.com Save Unicel]</ref> As a result, Unicel in Vermont only will be sold to another company.

In May 2007, Vermont passed measures intended to make broadband (3 mbits minimum) together with cellular coverage universally available to all citizens with the intention of having the first e-state in the Union by 2010.<ref>[http://blog.tomevslin.com/2007/01/vermont_the_fir.html A Synopsis of the extent of the measure to extend broadband]</ref>

In 2008 [[Comcast]] started to extend additional cable access throughout the state.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3675/is_200602/ai_n17179866 Bnet Business Network] accessed [[February 21]], [[2008]]</ref> In 2007, 2/3 of all Vermonters had access to cable. At the end of this 2008 initiative, 90% of Vermonters will have access.

== Law and government ==
{{main|Government of Vermont}}

Vermont is federally represented in the [[United States Congress]] by two senators and one representative.

The state is governed by a [[Vermont Constitution|constitution]] which divides governmental duties into legislative, executive and judicial branches: the [[Vermont General Assembly]], the [[Governor of Vermont]] and the [[Vermont Supreme Court]]. The governorship and the General Assembly serve two-year terms including the governor and 50 senators. There are no [[term limits in the United States|term limit]]s for any office. The state capital is in Montpelier.

There are three types of incorporated municipalities in Vermont: towns, cities, and villages. Like most of New England, there is slight provision for autonomous county government. Counties and county seats are merely convenient repositories for various government services such as County and State Courts, with several elected officers such as a State's Attorney and Sheriff. All county services are directly funded by the State of Vermont. The next effective governmental level below state government are municipalities. Most of these are towns.<ref>[http://www.sec.state.vt.us/municipal/pubs/who'swho.html town offices]</ref>

An in-depth evaluation of government ranked Vermont high compared to other states. It ranked highest in "small discrete issues and huge global ones." It performed poorly in the issues in-between and planning for the future.<ref>[http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/uploadedFiles/Grading-the-States-2008.pdf Pew Report 2008] accessed [[March 26]], [[2008]]</ref>

=== Political ===
{{main|Politics of Vermont}}<!---please ensure that your contribution has been vetted in the main article before summarizing it here.---->
{{seealso|United States Congressional Delegations from Vermont|Category:Vermont elections}}

Vermonters have been known for their political independence. Vermont is one of four states that were once [[Republic of Vermont|independent]] (the others being Texas, California, and Hawaii). It has sometimes voted contrarian in national elections. Notably, Vermont is the only state to have voted for a presidential candidate from the [[Anti-Masonic Party]], and Vermont was one of only two states to vote against [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in all four of his presidential campaigns (the other was [[Maine]]).

Vermont's unique history and history of independent political thought has led to movements for the establishment of the [[Second Vermont Republic]] and other plans advocating [[secession]].<ref>These relatively small political movements are similar in nature to those found in [[California]], [[Hawaii]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Texas]]; although the historical contexts are variant.</ref> In 2007, about 13% of Vermont's population supported Vermont's withdrawal from the Republic. The percentage who supported this in 2005 was 8%.<ref>[http://www.vermontrepublic.org Second Vermont Republic<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/local/vermont/articles/2007/06/03/in_vermont_nascent_secession_movement_gains_traction In Vermont, nascent secession movement gains traction - Boston.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Republicans dominated Vermont politics from the party's founding in 1854 until the mid-1970s. Prior to the 1960s, rural interests dominated the legislature. As a result, cities, particularly the older sections of Burlington and Winooski, were neglected and fell into decay. People began to move out to newer suburbs. 

In the meantime, many people had moved in from out of state. Much of this immigration included the arrival of more liberal political influences of the urban areas of New York and New England in Vermont.<ref>{{cite web | title=The World|work=Rise of the Democratic Party | url=http://www.vt-world.com/Archive/2004/February_18_2004/Features.htm | accessdate=2006-12-25}}</ref>  

After the legislature was redistricted under one-person, one-vote, it passed legislation to accommodate these new arrivals.
This legislation was the Land Use and Development Law ([[Act 250 (US law)|Act 250]]) in 1970. The law, which was the first of its kind in the nation, created nine District Environmental Commissions consisting of private citizens, appointed by the Governor, who must approve land development and subdivision plans that would have a significant impact on the state's environment and many small communities. 

As a result of Act 250, Vermont was the last state to get a Wal-Mart (there are four, as of March 2008, but only the Williston store was new construction). 

Another case involves the recent controversy over the adoption of [[civil union]]s, an institution which grants same-sex couples nearly all the rights and privileges of [[marriage]]. In ''[[Baker v. Vermont]]'' (1999), the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that, under the [[Constitution of Vermont]], the state must either allow [[same-sex marriage]] or provide a [[separate but equal]] status for them. The state legislature chose the second option by creating the institution of [[civil union]]; the bill was passed by the legislature and signed into law by Governor [[Howard Dean]]. 

Vermont is one of only two states represented by a member of the United States Congress who does not currently associate with a political party: [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Bernie Sanders]] describes his political views as [[socialism|socialist]], but caucuses with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] in the selection of the Senate leadership.<ref>Powell, Michael. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/04/AR2006110401124.html Exceedingly Social, But Doesn't Like Parties. ''The Washington Post'' [[November 5]], [[2006]].</ref>
In the early 1960s many [[progressivism|progressive]] Vermont Republicans and newcomers to the state helped bolster the state's small Democratic Party. Until 1992, Vermont had supported a Democrat for president only once since the party's founding&mdash;in [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s 1964 landslide victory against [[Barry Goldwater]]. In 1992, it supported Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] for president and has voted for Democrats in every presidential election since. Vermont gave John Kerry his fourth-largest margin of victory in 2004. He won the state's popular vote by 20 percentage points over incumbent [[George W. Bush]], taking almost 59% of the vote. [[Essex County, Vermont|Essex County]] in the state's northeastern section was the only county to vote for Bush. Vermont still remains the only state that President Bush has not visited.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/12/28/vermont.banning.bush.ap/index.html?iref=mpstoryview Activists in Vermont town want Bush, Cheney subject to arrest - CNN.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On the other hand, Republican Governor Douglas won all counties but Windham in the 2006 election. Vermonters are frequent ticket-splitters.<ref>{{cite web | title=Vermont General Elections|work=For Governor  | url=http://vermont-elections.org/elections1/2006GEGov.xls | accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref>

In 2007, when confronted with an allegedly liberal issue, assisted suicide for the terminally ill, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives rejected the measure by a vote of 82-63.<ref>[http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=54843 It's sudden death in Vermont for assisted suicide proposal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Minor parties flourish. Rules which eliminate smaller parties from the ballot in most states do not exist in Vermont. As a result, voters often have extensive choices for general elections.

A political issue has been [[Act 60 (Vermont law)|Act 60]], which balances taxation for education funding. This has resulted in the town of [[Killington, Vermont secession movement|Killington]] trying to secede from Vermont and join [[New Hampshire]] due to what the locals say is an unfair tax burden.<ref>[http://www.nhpr.org/node/8429 Killington Secession Not Too Popular in VT | New Hampshire Public Radio]</ref><ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/Northeast/03/02/killington.secession.ap/ CNN.com - Killington residents vote to secede from Vermont - [[March 4]], [[2004]]]</ref>

A movement favors separating Vermont from the U.S. or making it the 11<sup>th</sup> province of Canada. Some suggest the state should join Canada due to its liberal policies as opposed to remaining with the U.S.<ref>http://www.vermontcanada.org/reasons.html Vermont Canada retrieved on [[June 6]], [[2007]]</ref><ref>http://baheyeldin.com/canada/state-of-vermont-wants-to-join-canada.html retrieved on [[June 6]], [[2007]]</ref> 

The Vermont constitution and the courts supports the right of a person to walk (fish and hunt) on any unposted, unfenced land. That is trespass must be proven by the owner; it is not automatically assumed.<ref>[http://www.usconstitution.net/vtconst.html#Section67 Vermont Constitution] retrieved [[May 29]], [[2008]]</ref>

===Taxation===
Property taxes are levied by towns based on fair market appraisal. Rates vary from .97% on homesteaded property in Ferdinand, Essex County, to 2.72% on nonresidents property in Barre City.<ref>{{PDFlink|http://www.vermontproperty.com/newsltr/2005effectivetaxrates.pdf|111&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 113965 bytes -->}}</ref> Statewide towns average 1.77% to 1.82% tax rate. To equitably support education, some towns are required by [[Act 60 (Vermont law)|Act 60]] to send some of their collected taxes to be redistributed to school districts lacking adequate support.<ref>[http://education.vermont.gov/new/html/laws/act60.html Laws & Regulations: Act 60 Links & Resources<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Higher education===
Experimentation at the University of Vermont by George Perkins Marsh, and later the influence of Vermont born philosopher and educator [[John Dewey]] brought about the concepts of electives and learning by doing. Today Vermont has five colleges within the [[Vermont State Colleges]] system, [[University of Vermont|UVM]], fourteen other private, degree-granting colleges, including [[Middlebury College]], a private, co-educational liberal arts college founded in 1800, [[Burlington College]] and [[Champlain College]], both located in Burlington, are the two primary private colleges of Vermont's largest city, the [[Vermont Law School]] at Royalton, and [[Norwich University]], the oldest private military college in the United States and birthplace of [[ROTC]], founded in 1819.
