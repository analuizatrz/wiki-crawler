He has gained further acclaim for recent dramatic roles, such as in the acclaimed films ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost In Translation]]'', ''[[Broken Flowers]]'' and ''[[The Royal Tenenbaums]]''.


==Biography==
===Early life===
Murray was born and raised in [[Wilmette, Illinois]], the fifth of nine children of Edward J. Murray II, a [[lumber]] salesman, and Lucille Collins,[http://landing.ancestry.com/famoustree/Tree.aspx?name=murray&sourceCode=6865] both [[Irish American]] [[Catholic]]s. [http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2001/02/06/murray/index.html] Three of Murray's siblings are also actors: [[John Murray (actor)|John Murray]], [[Joel Murray]], and [[Brian Doyle-Murray]]. A sister, Nancy, is an Adrian [[Dominican nuns|Dominican Sister]] in [[Illinois]]. Murray graduated from [[Loyola Academy]], after which he attended [[Regis University]] in [[Denver, Colorado]] before [[dropping out]] to pursue his comedy career.(AP)

===Early career===
[[Image:Bill_Murray_making_pizza_Evanston_Illinois_1971.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Bill Murray making pizza at [[Little Caesars|Little Caesars Pizza]], Evanston, Illinois, 1971]]With an invitation from his older brother, Brian, Murray got his start at [[The Second City|Second City Chicago]] studying under [[Del Close]]. The [[improvisational comedy]] troupe was a perfect fit for Murray's clever, dry humor and [[ad-lib]]bing. While in Chicago, Murray worked at [[Little Caesar's]] alongside now-celebrity chef [[Kerry Simon]]. He eventually became a featured player on ''The [[National Lampoon]] Radio Hour'', aired on some 600 stations between [[1973]] and [[1975]].

===''Saturday Night Live''===
In 1975, he landed his first television role as a cast member of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[variety show]] ''[[Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell]]''. That same season, another variety show titled ''NBC's Saturday Night'' premiered. Cosell's show lasted just one season. 

After working in Los Angeles with the "guerrilla video" commune [[TVTV]] on a number of projects, Murray rose to prominence when he joined the cast of [[NBC]]'s newly-titled ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' the following season, replacing [[Chevy Chase]]. This was initially a turbulent experience for Murray. He often flubbed his lines and seemed awkward on camera. Chase had been the most popular cast member and some fans sent Murray [[hate mail]] stating he was a poor replacement. When Chase appeared as a guest host that season, they reportedly got into a fist fight backstage. But by the end of Murray's first season, he had begun to display his witty, laid-back [[persona]].  His characters, such as Nick the Lounge Singer and [[nerd]] Todd DiLamuca, became very popular with viewers. With the departure of [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[John Belushi]] in 1979, Murray became the most popular member of the [[ensemble cast]]. In 1980, the entire cast left the show.

Murray later revisited the troupe he started with in the TV special ''Bill Murray Live From the Second City'' in 1980.

===Film career===
[[Image:Lost in Translation still 1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Murray with [[Scarlett Johansson]] in ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]'']] Murray landed his first starring role with the film ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]'' in 1979. He followed up with his portrayal of famed writer [[Hunter S. Thompson]] in 1980s ''[[Where the Buffalo Roam]]''. In the early [[1980s]], he starred in a string of box-office hits including ''[[Caddyshack]]'', ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'' and ''[[Tootsie]]'' (in an unlikely  and uncredited dramatic supporting role). 

Murray began work on a [[film adaptation]] of the novel ''[[The Razor's Edge]]''. The film, which Murray also co-wrote,  was his first starring role in a [[dramatic film]]. He later agreed to star in ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' in a role originally written for [[John Belushi]]. This was a deal Murray made with [[Columbia Pictures]] in order to gain financing for his film. ''Ghostbusters'' became the highest-grossing film of 1984. But ''[[The Razor's Edge (1984 film)|The Razor's Edge]]'', which was filmed before ''Ghostbusters'' but not released until after, was a box-office flop. Upset over the failure of ''Razor's Edge'', Murray took four years off from acting to study [[French language|French]] at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. With the exception of a memorable [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in the [[1986 in film|1986]] movie ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', he did not make any appearances in films.

Murray returned to films in 1988 with ''[[Scrooged]]'' and followed up with the long-awaited [[sequel]] ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'' in 1989. In 1990, Murray made his first and only attempt at directing when he co-helmed ''[[Quick Change]]'' with producer [[Howard Franklin]]. Subsequent films ''[[What About Bob?]]'' (1991) and ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'' (1993) were box-office hits and critically acclaimed. 

After a string of films that did not do well with audiences (besides ''[[Kingpin (film)|Kingpin]]'', in which he played a supporting role), he received much critical acclaim for [[Wes Anderson]]'s ''[[Rushmore (film)|Rushmore]]'' for which he won several awards. Murray then experienced a resurgence in his career as a dramatic actor. After dramatic roles in ''[[Wild Things]]'', ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'', and ''[[Hamlet (2000 movie)|Hamlet]]'' (as [[Polonius]]), and a comedic role in Wes Anderson's ''[[The Royal Tenenbaums]]'', he garnered considerable acclaim for the [[2003 in film|2003]] film ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]''. He received a [[Golden Globe Award]] and a [[BAFTA]] award. He was also nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], in what was considered to be a two-horse race between him and [[Sean Penn]], who eventually prevailed. In an interview included on the ''Lost in Translation'' DVD, Murray states that this is his favorite movie in which he has appeared. 

[[Image:MurrayTable.jpg|thumb|200px|Bill Murray as Don Johnston in ''Broken Flowers''.]]
During this time, Murray still appeared in comedic roles such as ''[[Charlie's Angels (film)|Charlie's Angels]]'' and ''[[Osmosis Jones]]''. In 2004, he provided the voice of [[Garfield]] in ''[[Garfield (film)|Garfield: The Movie]]'' and marked his third collaboration with Wes Anderson in ''[[The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou]]''. Murray also garnered acclaim for his dramatic role in [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s ''[[Broken Flowers]]''.

In [[2005]], he announced that he would take a break from acting, as he had not had the time since his new breakthrough in the late-[[1990s]]. His last film role to date is Garfield's voice in the sequel  ''[[Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties]]''. [[Dan Aykroyd]] has recently confirmed in an [http://www.cisnfm.com/station/blog_mike_mcguire.cfm?bid=7500 interview] with CISN Country that Murray will be reprising his role as the voice of Dr. Peter Venkman in ''[[Ghostbusters III]]'', which will be done with [[computer animation]] partially because Murray refused to act in a live action sequel.

===Personal life===
Murray wed Margaret Kelly in 1980. They had two sons, Homer (born 1982) and Luke (born 1985), before divorcing in 1994. In [[1997]], he married [[Jennifer Butler]]. They have four children together: Cal (born 1993), Jackson (born 1995), Cooper (born 1996), and Lincoln (born 2001).

He is a partner with his brothers in Murray Bros. Caddy Shack, a restaurant chain with locations near [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] and in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]] and [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]. Murray is an avid golfer who often plays in celebrity tournaments.  His [[1999 in literature|1999]] book ''Cinderella Story: My Life in Golf'', part [[autobiography]] and part [[essay]], expounds on his love of golf. In 2002, he and his brothers starred in the [[Comedy Central]] series, ''[[The Sweet Spot]]'', which chronicled their adventures playing golf.

He is a part-owner of the [[St. Paul Saints]] independent minor-league [[baseball]] team and occasionally travels to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] to watch the team's games.  He also owns part of the [[Charleston RiverDogs]], [[Hudson Valley Renegades]], and the [[Brockton Rox]].  He invested in a number of other minor league teams in the past, including the [[Utica Blue Sox]], Miami Miracle, and Salt Lake Trappers.

Very detached from the [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] scene, Murray does not have an agent or manager and reportedly[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,176-1476612,00.html] only fields offers for scripts and roles using a personal telephone number with a voice mailbox that he checks infrequently. This practice has the downside of sometimes preventing him from taking parts that he had auditioned for and was interested in, such as that of Sulley in ''[[Monsters, Inc]]'' and [[Willy Wonka]] in ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]].'' Murray has homes in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston, SC]], and [[New York]].

During the [[2000 election|2000 presidential campaign]], Murray stumped for [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] candidate [[Ralph Nader]].

Murray is a huge fan of Chicago pro sports teams, especially the [[Chicago Cubs]] and the [[Chicago Bears]]. He also is a big [[Michael Jordan]] fan and has made cameo appearances in ''[[Space Jam]]'' and Jordan documentaries.  He also cheered courtside for the [[Illinois Fighting Illini]]'s game versus the [[University of North Carolina]] in the NCAA Basketball Tournament's championship game in 2005.

==Trivia==
{{Unreferenced|date=January 2007}}
*Murray was the first guest on both of [[David Letterman]]'s long-running late night television programs.  He appeared on the first episode of [[Late Night with David Letterman]] on [[February 1]], [[1982]], as well as the inaugural episode of [[Late Show with David Letterman]] on [[August 30]], [[1993]].  In addition, he was the first guest on ''Late Show'' on [[February 1]], [[2007]], as David Letterman celebrated his 25th anniversary in late night.
*[[Lorenzo Music]] voiced Murray's character, [[Peter Venkman|Venkman]], in ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'' cartoon series. Music is best-known for voicing [[Garfield]] the cat in various cartoon series. Murray would go on to be the voice of Garfield in the ''[[Garfield (film)|2004 film]]'' and ''[[Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties|2006 film]]''.
*Murray is said to have a policy of not doing a third version of anything, which is one of the reasons ''Ghostbusters III'' has been reported to be in [[development hell]], but his filmography would also seem to suggest that he has not been offered a third version of anything besides ''Ghostbusters''. It is possible he will be offered a second sequel to ''Garfield''.
*In early February 2007, Dan Aykroyd revealed in an interview that Bill Murray agreed to provide the voice of Dr. Venkman in an upcoming animated Ghostbusters sequel, after having upheld his refusal to appear in a live-action sequel.
*He was named #1 Smartass on [[Comedy Central]]'s "List of the 51 Greatest Smartasses."
*Appeared on [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC's]] ''[[American Chopper]]'' during which the Teutuls did a Caddyshack-themed bike.
