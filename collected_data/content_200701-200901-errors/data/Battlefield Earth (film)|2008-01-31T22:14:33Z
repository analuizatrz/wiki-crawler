'''''Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000''''' is a [[2000 in film|2000]] film adaptation of the [[Battlefield Earth (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[L. Ron Hubbard]]. The film stars [[John Travolta]], [[Forrest Whitaker]] and [[Barry Pepper]]. It was a notorious commercial and critical disaster and has been widely criticized as one of the "[[Films considered the worst ever|worst films ever made]]".<ref name="duncancampbell" /><ref name="Travolta Sets Sights">{{cite web|url=http://cache-origin.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=51e04b9f-62f2-475c-a813-3ef6f414da49 |title=Travolta Sets Sights on "Battlefield Earth 2" |accessdate=2007-03-26 |last=Farache |first=Emily |date=[[2000-10-18]] |publisher=E!

The film depicts an Earth that has been under the rule of the alien Psychlos for 1,000 years. The Psychlos' greedy chief of security on Earth, Terl (Travolta), seeks to buy his way off what he regards as a backward planet inhabited by primitive "man-animals". He enslaves humans to mine gold for him in areas that the Psychlos cannot reach and puts one of his slaves, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Pepper), in charge of the mining project. Tyler is instructed in the use of Psychlo technology but turns his new-found knowledge against the Psychlos, leading a human uprising against the aliens. He forms an army of liberated slaves and trains them in the use of human weapons found in a thousand-year-old US military depot. The rebellion succeeds with the humans overthrowing the Psychlos and blowing up their home planet.<ref>{{cite news   | last =Staff | first =  | coauthors =  | title = Battlefield Earth | work = [[Sight & Sound]] | pages =  | language =  | publisher =[[British Film Institute]]| date = May 2000 | url =  | accessdate =  }}</ref>

Travolta, a long-time [[Scientology|Scientologist]], had sought for many years to deliver a big-screen adaptation of the novel by Hubbard, the founder of Scientology. He was unable to obtain funding from any major studio due to concerns about the film's script, prospects and the connections with Scientology. The project was eventually taken on by an independent production company, Franchise Pictures, which specialized in rescuing stars' stalled pet projects. Travolta signed on as a co-producer and contributed millions of dollars of his own money to the production, which was largely funded by a German film distribution company. The investors later successfully sued and bankrupted Franchise after it emerged that the company had fraudulently overstated the film's budget by $31 million.<ref name="fiasco">{{cite book | title=Fiasco: A History of Hollywood's Iconic Flops| last=Parish| first=James Robert| date=2007| pages=275-291| publisher=Wiley| isbn=0470098295}}</ref>

Reviewers wrote scathingly of the film, criticizing virtually every aspect of the production. Audiences were reported to have greeted early screenings with derision and stayed away in droves after a lackluster opening weekend, causing the film's earnings to fall far short of its costs. Travolta had originally envisaged the film as being the first of two adapted from the book, as ''Battlefield Earth's'' screenplay only covered the novel's first half. However, the failure of the film meant that the planned sequel was not made.<ref name="fiasco" />

== Plot synopsis ==
In the year 3000, Earth is ruled by the Psychlos, a brutal race of giant humanoid aliens who conquered the planet a thousand years previously. The remnants of humanity are either enslaved by the Psychlos and used for manual labor or survive in primitive tribes living in remote areas outside Psychlo control. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Pepper), a member of one such tribe, leaves his home in the [[Rocky Mountains]] on a journey of exploration. He joins forces with Carlo (Coates), a hunter. Before long, both men are captured by a Psychlo raiding party and transported to a slave camp at the Psychlos' main base on Earth, a giant dome built over the ruins of [[Denver]].

Terl (Travolta), the Psychlo Security Chief on Earth, has been condemned by his superiors to remain indefinitely at his post as punishment for his greediness and incompetent plotting. Aided by his deputy Ker (Whittaker), Terl devises a plan to buy his way off the planet by making a fortune using human slaves to mine gold in radioactive areas, where Psychlos are unable to go due to the explosiveness of the gas that they breathe. Terl selects Jonnie as his "foreman" for the project and subjects him to a learning machine that educates him in Psychlo knowledge. Terl gives Jonnie a party of slaves and a Psychlo flying shuttle and orders him to go out and find gold.

Inspired to revolt by the sight of a copy of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] which he finds in the ruins of [[Denver Public Library]], Jonnie plots a human uprising against the Psychlos. He obtains gold from [[Fort Knox]] to satisfy Terl's demands, instead of mining gold as ordered. Jonnie and his followers find an abandoned underground US military base with working aircraft, weapons, fuel, and nuclear bombs. They use the base's flight simulators to train themselves in aerial combat.

After a week's training, the rebels launch a mass uprising against the Psychlos using [[AV-8 Harrier II|Harrier]] jump-jets and other weapons. The hunter Carlo sacrifices himself to destroy the dome over Denver. The Psychlos inside suffocate on the Earth's atmosphere, which they are unable to breathe. Jonnie captures a Psychlo teleportation device and uses it to teleport an atomic bomb to the Psychlo home world. The ensuing detonation causes the entire Psychlo atmosphere to explode, wiping out the planet. Ker and Terl survive on Earth, but face different fates: Ker sides with the victorious humans, while Terl is imprisoned as a hostage. The film ends with the humans in control of Earth but facing an uncertain future.

== Development ==

After ''Battlefield Earth'' was published in 1982, L. Ron Hubbard suggested that a film version of the book was in the works. He gave an interview in February 1983 to the ''Rocky Mountain News'' in which he told the reporter, "I've recently written three screenplays and some interest has been expressed in ''Battlefield Earth'', so I suppose I'll be right back in Hollywood one of these days and probably on location in the Denver area for ''Battlefield Earth'' when they film it." <ref name="lamont">{{cite book | title=[[Religion Inc.]]| last=Lamont| first=Stewart| date=1986| pages=156| publisher=Harrap| location=London| isbn=0245543341}}</ref> 

Hubbard's comments suggest that he saw himself being directly involved in the film; author Stewart Lamont suggests that Hubbard may even have envisioned directing it, given his previous work on [[Scientology]] training films.<ref name="lamont" /> In October 1983, the film rights were sold by the [[Church of Scientology]]'s in-house literary agency, [[Author Services Inc.]], to Salem Productions of [[Los Angeles]]. Two films were envisaged, covering each half of the book and tentatively budgeted at $15 million each.<ref>{{cite news   | last =[[Author Services Inc.]]| first =  | coauthors =  | title =Press Release| work =   | pages =  | language =  | publisher =[[Business Wire]]| date =[[October 14]], [[1983]]  | url =  | accessdate =  }}</ref> William Immerman was set as the producer for the film.<ref name="blowen">{{cite news   | last =Blowen  | first =Michael  | coauthors =  | title =Welles Returns to Direct  | work =[[Boston Globe]]  | pages =69  | language =  | publisher =Globe Newspaper Company  | date =[[November 27]], [[1984]]  | url =  | accessdate =  }}</ref> The veteran screenwriter [[Abraham Polonsky]] and the British director [[Ken Annakin]] were hired to produce a film breakdown, with production scheduled to begin in 1985.<ref>{{cite news   | last = [[Author Services Inc.]] | first =  | coauthors =  | title =Press Release  | work =  | pages =  | language =  | publisher = [[Business Wire]]  | date =[[April 18]], [[1984]]  | url =  | accessdate =  }}</ref> In November 1984, [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] public relations firm Dateline Communiations announced a nationwide contest to promote the film.<ref name="blowen" />  First and second place prizes were an all-expense paid trip to the film's production location and a paid walk-on part in the film, and other announced prizes included a trip to Los Angeles for the world premiere, records, cassettes, and hardcover and paperback copies of the novel.<ref name="blowen" /> A 30-foot (10 m) high inflatable figure of the film's villain, Terl, was erected by Scientology officials on Hollywood Boulevard in 1984 in an effort to promote the production and auditions were held in Denver. However, the low-budget project soon collapsed.<ref name="ladn">{{cite news   | last = Whipp  | first = Glenn  | title = The Battle For 'Earth': Travolta's Scientology Ties Raise Controversy Over New Film  | publisher = [[Los Angeles Daily News]]  | date = 2000-05-12 }}</ref>

John Travolta, who had converted to Scientology in 1975, received an autographed copy of ''Battlefield Earth'' from Hubbard when the book was first published in 1982. Hubbard reportedly hoped that Travolta would turn the book into a film "in the vein of ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]''."<ref name="hs">{{cite news   | title = Science Friction  | publisher = [[Herald Sun]]  | date = 2006-04-12 }}</ref> At the time, however, Travolta's influence in Hollywood was at a low ebb after a series of flops. The success of the 1994 movie ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]],'' for which Travolta was nominated for the Best Actor [[Academy Award]], made him a major player again.<ref>{{cite news   | last =Hernandez  | first =Greg  | coauthors =  | title =Travolta in a Fever Once Again   | work =Daily News of Los Angeles   | pages =A2  | language =  | publisher =  | date =[[December 6]], [[2007]]  | url =  | accessdate =  }}</ref> He had not forgotten Hubbard's wishes to see the book on the big screen and so took on the task of making ''Battlefield Earth'' into a movie.<ref>{{cite news   | last = Pearlman  | first = Cindy  | title = Travolta Wins His Fight To Film 'Battlefield Earth'  | publisher = [[The Plain Dealer (newspaper)]]  | date = 2000-05-07 }}</ref> Travolta, a devoted Scientologist and one of the organization's most vocal supporters, described the book in interviews as "like ''Pulp Fiction'' for the year 3000"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw5672.html |title=Uphill Battlefield for John Travolta and Roger Christian  |accessdate=2006-09-04 |last=Lee |first=Patrick |date=[[2000-05-15]] |work=Sci Fi Weekly |publisher=SciFi.com}}</ref> and "like ''[[Star Wars]]'', only better."<ref name=vain>{{cite web | first = Mark | last = Morris | title = You're so vain... | url = http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,,319213,00.html | work =  | publisher = [[The Observer]] | date = [[2000-05-28]] | accessdate = 2008-01-11 }}</ref> Travolta lobbied a variety of Hollywood figures and was reported to have recruited the aid of fellow Scientologists. According to Bill Mechanic, the former head of [[Twentieth Century Fox]], "He had Scientologists all over me. They come up to you and they know who you are." This did not impress Mechanic: "Do you think in any way, shape, or form that weirding me out is going to make me want to make this movie?" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2006/09/brad-greys-scientology-scare.php |title=Brad Grey's Scientology Scare |accessdate=2006-09-24 |last=Bercovici |first=Jeff |date=[[2006-09-15]] |work=Radar Online |publisher=Radar magazine}}</ref>

Explaining his motivation, Travolta stated that "I have a special affection for this book. Hubbard was a great writer, and I had an idea of the movie's potential, a fantasy in my mind that lasted for years."<ref name="nyt_14may00">{{cite news   | last = Hirschberg  | first = Lynn  | title = The Samaha Formula for Hollywood Success  | publisher = [[New York Times]]  | date = 2000-05-14

Travolta's involvement in ''Battlefield Earth'' was first publicised in late 1995.<ref>{{cite news   | last =Staff  | first =  | coauthors =  | title =Travolta in line to rewrite superstar salary scale  | work =[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =  | date =November 13, 1995 - November 19, 1995  | url =  | accessdate =  }}</ref> It was assumed from the start that he would star in and produce the film, which would be distributed by [[MGM]]; [[J.D.

The author James Robert Parish comments that both studios regarded the project as too risky, on several grounds.<ref name="fiasco" /> Its heavy reliance on special effects would be very expensive, pushing the budget up to as much as $100 million; Hubbard's narrative was seen as naive and outdated; and the "Scientology factor" could work against the film, negating Travolta's star power. <ref name="fiasco" /> As one studio executive put it, "On any film there are ten variables that can kill you. On this film there was an eleventh: Scientology. It just wasn't something anyone really wanted to get involved with." <ref name="dixon">{{cite book | title=Visions of the Apocalypse: Spectacles of Destruction in American Cinema| last=Dixon| first=Wheeler Winston| date=2003| pages=115-116| publisher=Wallflower Press| isbn=1903364744}}</ref>

Finally, in 1998, the project was taken over by Franchise Entertainment. The company's head Elie Samaha, a former drycleaning mogul turned nightclub owner, specialized in rescuing stars' pet projects. Franchise sought out major stars whose projects were stalled at the major studios, bringing them aboard at reduced salaries. Samaha's approach made waves in Hollywood, earning him a reputation of being able to produce star vehicles more cheaply than the major studios.<ref name="variety_10may04" /> However, his unorthodox deals raised eyebrows, with the entertainment industry magazine ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' commenting that they were "often so complex and variable as to leave outsiders scratching their heads." <ref>{{cite news   | last =Bing  | first =Jonathan   | coauthors =  | title =The Samaha Syndrome  | work =[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =  | date =[[June 9]], [[2003]]  | url =  | accessdate =  }}</ref> As Samaha put it, "With my movies, the movie stars are my partners. If you give them 25 percent of the profits (while reducing their upfront payments), they get out of the trailer faster."<ref name="nyt_14may00" /> He learned of ''Battlefield Earth'' via Cassian Elwes, an agent at the theatrical agency William Morris, and approached Travolta.<ref name="nyt_14may00" /> A deal was soon struck and financing was arranged; Travolta significantly reduced his normal fee of $20 million, lowering the film's cost from the $100 million that had previously been forecast, and costs were reduced further by utilizing Canadian locations and facilities.<ref name="hs" /> 

The film was set up as an independent production for [[Morgan Creek Productions]] which would, in turn, release the film through [[Warner Bros.]] in the U.S. under an existing distribution agreement.  Travolta's company JTP Films was also involved,<ref>{{cite news   | last =Staff  | first =  | coauthors =  | title =Christian to direct Travolta in 'Earth'  | work =[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =  | date =[[January 14]], [[1999]]  | url =  | accessdate =  }}</ref> with Travolta investing $5 million of his own money in the production.<ref>{{cite news   | last =Schneller  | first =Johanna   | coauthors =  | title =Vanity projects are like land mines.

The Intertainment deal later became the focus of a legal action that bankrupted Franchise.<ref name="variety_10may04" /> Samaha forecast that the film would be a major hit: "My projected numbers on ''Battlefield Earth'' are really conservative. I'm already covered internationally, and there's no way I'm going to lose if the movie does $35 million domestically. And Travolta has never had an action movie do under $35 million." <ref name="nyt_14may00" />

According to Samaha, he got around the "negative factor" of the Scientology connection by the simple expedient of "yell[ing] at everyone, 'This is a science-fiction film starring John Travolta!' again and again." <ref name="dixon" /> Samaha acknowledged that "everyone thought I was crazy or mentally retarded" for taking on the project, but pitched the film as "''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' starring John Travolta".<ref name=Dreams /> He was bullish about the film's prospects, telling the ''Wall Street Journal'' that "it is going to make people in Hollywood take notice of Elie Samaha.

Travolta's manager Jonathan Krane denied that the Church of Scientology was playing any part in the production: "I've never even dealt with or talked to the church on this.

==Production==

Travolta and his manager, Jonathan Krane, took the lead in hiring the on-set personnel. They initially approached [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct the film. When Tarantino declined, [[Roger Christian (filmmaker)|Roger Christian]], a protégé of [[George Lucas]], was recruited as the director.<ref name="nyt_14may00" /> He had most recently been the [[second unit]] director on Lucas' ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]''.<ref>{{cite news   | last =Staff  | first =  | coauthors =  | title =Roger Christian  | work =[[Internet Movie Database]]  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =  | date =  | url =http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002337/  | accessdate = 2008-01-20 }}</ref> [[Patrick Tatopoulos]] was signed to develop the production design and costume, including the design of the alien Psychlos,<ref name="time" /> and the Czech-American composer [[Elia Cmiral]] was signed to provide the film's score.<ref name="space">[http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/movies/battlefield_earth_christian_000511.html 'Battlefield' Director: Pulp Sci-Fi or Modern Myth?], Space.com, 11 May 2000</ref> Travolta and Krane also signed the cinematographer and most of the principal actors.<ref name="nyt_14may00" />

The cast included Travolta, [[Barry Pepper]], [[Forest Whitaker]], [[Kim Coates]], [[Richard Tyson]], Sabine Karsenti, and [[Michael Byrne (actor)|Michael Byrne]]. Travolta's wife [[Kelly Preston]] also appeared in one scene. Travolta originally saw himself in the role of Tyler, but by the time the movie was actually made, Travolta felt he was too old to play the role, and took the role of the main villain instead.<ref>{{cite news   | last =Staff  | first =  | coauthors =  | title =John Travolta on 'Battlefield', NASA  | work =Space.com  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =  | date =[[May 3]], [[2000]]  | url =  | accessdate =  }}</ref>

''Mean's'' staffers changed the script's title to "Dark Forces" by "Desmond Finch" and circulated it to readers at a number of major Hollywood film production companies. The comments that came back were universally unfavorable: "a thoroughly silly plotline is made all the more ludicrous by its hamfisted dialog and ridiculously shallow characterizations", "a completely predictable story that just isn't written well enough to make up for its lack of originality."

The film's exceptionally bad reviews and poor word-of-mouth led to a precipitous falling-off in its grosses. Having earned $11,548,898 from 3,307 screens on its opening weekend, its take collapsed by 67% to $3,924,921 the following weekend, giving an average take of only $1,158 per screen.<ref name="natpost" /> The film made 95% of its entire domestic gross in the first two weekends and flatlined thereafter, with earnings dropping a further 75% by the end of its third week to only $1 million.<ref name="hs" /> 

The following week, facing earnings of just $205,745, Warner Bros. attempted to cut its losses by slashing the number of screens at which the film was being shown. The number was reduced from 2,587 to only 641.<ref>{{cite news   | last =Lyons   | first =Charles   | coauthors =Dana Harris  | title =Samaha ducking the bullets on 'Battlefield'  | work =[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =  | date =[[June 12]], [[2000]]  | url =  | accessdate =  }}</ref> By its sixth weekend on release, the film was showing on only 95 screens and had made just $18,993 in a week - less than $200 per screen. <ref>{{cite news   | last =Staff  | first =  | coauthors =  | title =Business Data for Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000  | work =[[Internet Movie Database]]  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =  | date =  | url =http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185183/business  | accessdate =  2008-01-20}}</ref> International earnings were equally dire.

The ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]'' summarised the film as being "a flat-out mess, by golly, with massive narrative sinkholes, leading to moments of outstanding disbelief in the muddled writing and shockingly chaotic ''[[mise en scene]]'' that's accompanied by ear-pummeling sound and bombastic music."<ref>{{cite news   | last =Hunter  | first =David   | coauthors =  | title ='Battlefield Earth'  | work =[[Hollywood Reporter]]  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =  | date =[[May 12]], [[2000]]  | url =  | accessdate =  }}</ref>  In her book ''Celebrity Tantrums!: The Official Dirt'', Lisa Brandt called the film a "Scientology stinkburger".<ref>{{cite book  | last =Brandt   | first =Lisa   | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =Celebrity Tantrums!: The Official Dirt  | publisher =ECW Press  | date =2003  | location =  | pages =177  | url =  | doi =  | id =    | isbn =1550225669 }}</ref> The film is profiled in ''Better Living Through Bad Movies'' by Scott Clevenger and Sheri Zollinger, who comment "So what new truths have we gleaned from ''Battlefield Earth''?

The film was reported to have been greeted with widespread derision in preview screenings for the public and critics. An audience of Los Angeles entertainment journalists, critics and others greeted the film with "guffaws and hoots" at a screening in [[Century City]], while other viewers in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore responded with "derisive laughter" or simply walked out.

Responding to the criticism, the film's producer Elie Samaha complained that, "(The) critics were waiting for us to ... chop our heads off. Everybody hated Scientology for some reason. I didn't know people were so prejudiced." He argued that despite the film's poor performance it would cover its costs in due course: "Maybe (in) the second cycle with Internet, and HBO, and DVD, you always make your money ... so I'm not going to lose sleep over one movie that did not perform for us." <ref>{{cite news   | last =Powell  | first =Betsy   | coauthors =  | title =Power Producer All Fired Up  | work =Toronto Star  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =  | date =[[July 16]], [[2000]]  | url =  | accessdate =  }}</ref>

As Travolta did not attend to collect his trophies, an action figure of Terl, his character, accepted them in his place.

They're obviously doing their job. ... Not every film can be a critical and box office success. It would have been awful only if Battlefield Earth was neither. That's not the case.

The court heard testimony from Intertainment that according to Franchise's bank records the real cost of ''Battlefield Earth'' was only $44 million, not the $75 million declared by Franchise. The remaining $31 million had been fraudulent "padding". Intertainment's head Barry Baeres told the court that he had only funded ''Battlefield Earth'' because it was packaged as a slate that included two more commercially attractive films, the [[Wesley Snipes]] vehicle ''[[The Art of War (film)|The Art of War]]'' and the [[Bruce Willis]] comedy ''[[The Whole Nine Yards (film)|The Whole Nine Yards]]''.<ref name="variety_10may04" /> Baeres testified that "Mr. Samaha said, 'If you want the other two pictures, you have to take ''Battlefield Earth'' - it's called packaging'." Baeres commented that, "We would have been quite happy if he had killed [''Battlefield Earth'']." <ref>{{cite news   | last =Hiestand  | first =Jesse   | coauthors =  | title =Baeres: No secret budget deal  | work =Hollywood Reporter  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =  | date =[[May 10]], [[2004]]  | url =  | accessdate =  }}</ref>

Intertainment won the case and was awarded $121.7 million in damages, bankrupting Franchise Pictures. Samaha himself was declared by the court to be personally liable for $77 million in damages.<ref name="fiasco" /><ref>{{cite news   | last =Shprintz  | first =Janet   | coauthors =  | title =Attempt to Collect  | work =[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =  | date =[[June 21]], [[2004]]  | url =  | accessdate =  }}</ref> However, the jury rejected Intertainment's claims under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations]] (RICO) statute, which would have trebled the damages if Franchise had been convicted on that charge.<ref>{{cite news  | last =Shprintz  | first =Janet   | coauthors =  | title =Samaha Slammed  | work =[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =  | date = [[June 17]], [[2004]]  | url =  | accessdate =  }}</ref>

The failure of the film was also reported to have led in 2002 to Travolta sacking his manager Jonathan Krane, who had set up the deal with Franchise in the first place.<ref>{{cite news   | last =Staff  | first =  | coauthors =  | title =Krane Gives John No Lift  | work =Daily Mirror  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =  | date =[[April 2]], [[2002]]  | url =  | accessdate =  }}</ref>

==Followups and sequels==
''Battlefield Earth'' is significantly shorter than its source novel, covering only the first 436 pages of the 1,050-page book.<ref name="zoriannakit" /> A sequel covering the remainder of the book was originally planned at the outset.<ref name="zoriannakit" /> Corey Mandell, the scriptwriter for the first film, was commissioned to deliver the script for the sequel and Travolta, Pepper and producer Krane were all signed up to the sequel in their contracts for the first film.<ref name="zoriannakit" /> Christian and Whitaker were approached to reprise their respective roles, and the producers planned for a 2002 release date so as not to compete with George Lucas' ''[[Star Wars: Episode II]]''.<ref>{{cite news   | last =Staff  | first =  | coauthors =  | title ='Earth' Gets Sequel Before First Release  | work =The Journal Gazette  | pages =1D  | language =  | publisher =  | date =[[January 8]], [[2000]]  | url =  | accessdate =  }}</ref><ref name="zoriannakit">{{cite news   | last =Kit  | first =Zorianna   | coauthors =  | title ='Earth' Is Bound For 2nd Chapter  | work =Hollywood Reporter  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =  | date =[[January 6]], [[2000]]  | url = http://www.allbusiness.com/services/motion-pictures/4838060-1.html | accessdate =2008-01-20  }}</ref> However, the disastrous performance of ''Battlefield Earth'' and the collapse of its financial backers made it very unlikely that a live-action sequel will be made.<ref name="fiasco" /> 

Author Services announced in 2001 that Pine Com International, a [[Tokyo]]-based animation studio, would produce thirteen one-hour animated television segments based on the book and rendered in a [[manga]] style. <ref>{{cite news   | last =Staff  | first =  | coauthors =  | title =Battlefield Earth Soon To Become An Animated TV Series  | work =Battlefieldearth.com  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =[[Author Services Inc.]]  | date =  | url =http://www.battlefieldearth.com/news/betv.html 
  | accessdate = 2008-01-20 }}</ref> The plans appear to have fallen through and, according to author James Robert Parish, "little has been heard of the series since."<ref name="fiasco" />

== Parodies ==

''[[South Park]]'' has [[parody|parodied]] the film twice, first in a spoof at the 2000 [[MTV Movie Awards]], and then in the episode "[[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|Trapped in the Closet]]".<ref name="ortega">{{cite news   | last = Ortega  | first = Tony  | coauthors =  | title = Sympathy For The Devil: Tory Bezazian was a veteran Scientologist who loved going after church critics.

The MTV short was the first time ''South Park'' had satirized Scientology, in a piece entitled: "The Gauntlet". Though the short was primarily a ''[[Gladiator (film)|Gladiator]]'' parody, with the characters fighting [[Russell Crowe]] in the Roman [[Colosseum]], it included "[[John Travolta]] and the Church of Scientology" arriving in a spaceship to defeat Crowe and attempt to recruit the boys into Scientology. Travolta, along with his fellow Scientologists, was depicted as a Psychlo, as he appeared in the film.<ref name="mtv" />

A commentary for this film was released by [[RiffTrax]] in on [[January 28]], [[2007]].<ref name="rifftrax">{{cite news   | last = [[Michael J.
