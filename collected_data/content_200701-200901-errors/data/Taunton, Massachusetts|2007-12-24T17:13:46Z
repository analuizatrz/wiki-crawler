'''Taunton''' is a city in [[Bristol County, Massachusetts|Bristol County]], [[Massachusetts]],  [[United States]]. It is the  [[county seat|seat]] of [[Bristol County]] and the hub of the [[Greater Taunton Area]]. As of the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]], the city had a total population of 55,976.  

Taunton's nicknames are derived from its history. The moniker ''Silver City'' is born of Taunton's industrial past when companies such as [[F. B. Rogers Silver Co.|F. B. Rogers/International Silver Co.]] as well as Poole Silver and Reed & Barton produced silver goods throughout the city. ''Christmas City'' is still evident each December with Christmas celebrations on the Taunton Green. The name Taunton means "town (or city) on the river."

==History==
Taunton was founded in 1637 by [[Elizabeth Pole]], and officially [[incorporation (municipal government)|incorporated]] as a [[New England town|town]] on [[September 3]] [[1639]]. Most of the town's settlers were originally from [[Taunton, England|Taunton]], [[Somerset]], [[England]], which led early settlers to name the settlement after that town. At the time of Taunton's incorporation, they explained their choice of name as being, ''in honor and love to our dear native country... and owning it a great mercy of God to bring us to this place, and settling of us, on lands of our own bought with our money in peace, in the midst of the heathen, for a possession for ourselves and for our posterity after us.''{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Prior to 1640, the Taunton area was called Cohannet. 

[[Image:Taunton Massachusetts - Mayflower Hill Cemetery.jpg|thumb|left|Mayflower Hill Cemetery]]
The [[Great Britain|British]] founders of Taunton took possession of the land from the native [[Wampanoag]]s. The Taunton area was the site of battles (on its soil or the surrounding area) during various conflicts, including [[King Philip's War]] and the [[American Revolution]]. Taunton was re-incorporated as a city on [[May 11]] [[1864]].

Once a great industrial city, the "Silver City" was home to many [[silversmithing]] operations, including the Taunton Silversmiths, [[Reed & Barton]], [[Poole Silver]], and the [[F. B. Rogers Silver Co.|F. B. Rogers Silver Co./International Silver Co.]]  Various other industries operated throughout the city into the third quarter of the 20th century.

In October 2005, the nearby [[Whittenton Pond Dam]] threatened to fail following a week that brought nine inches of rain to the city. Over 2,000 city residents were evacuated<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/10/18/national/main952230.shtml | title=Town Braces For Massive Flood | publisher=CBS News | date=[[October 18]] [[2005]] | accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref> and Mayor Robert Nunes issued a [[State of Emergency]]. It is estimated that if the dam had failed, the Mill River would have inundated the downtown area with up to six feet of water. In response, Governor [[Mitt Romney]] ordered an immediate inspection of high-risk dams throughout the Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/10/18/national/main953863.shtml | title=Mass. Dam Continues To Hold | publisher=CBS News | date=[[October 18]] [[2005]] | accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/10/18/massachusetts.dam/index.html | title=Officials still fear dam collapse | date=[[October 18]] [[2005]] | publisher=CNN | accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref>

Taunton once included many surrounding towns, including [[Norton, Massachusetts|Norton]], [[Easton, Massachusetts|Easton]], [[Mansfield, Massachusetts|Mansfield]], [[Dighton, Massachusetts|Dighton]], [[Raynham, Massachusetts|Raynham]], and [[Berkley, Massachusetts|Berkley]].  Possession of the latter is still noted by the naming of [[Taunton Hill]] in [[Assonet, Massachusetts|Assonet]], which is now North Main Street, a street that heads into Berkley.

==Geography==
[[Image:Taunton waters.JPG|200px|thumb|An abstract map of Taunton's watershed]]

This is the second largest city by area in Massachusetts.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Only Boston, at {{convert|48.42|sqmi|sqkm|2}} of land, is larger.  

Taunton has one major river, the [[Taunton River]], alongside with its tributaries including the [[Mill River (Taunton River)|Mill River]] and the [[Three Mile River (Massachusetts)|Three Mile River]]. These rivers are within the [[Taunton River Watershed]].

The city is bordered by [[Norton, Massachusetts|Norton]] to the northwest, [[Easton, Massachusetts|Easton]] to the north, [[Raynham, Massachusetts|Raynham]] to the northeast, [[Lakeville, Massachusetts|Lakeville]] to the east, [[Berkley, Massachusetts|Berkley]] and [[Dighton, Massachusetts|Dighton]] to the south, and [[Rehoboth, Massachusetts|Rehoboth]] to the west. 

City neighborhoods include Clearview Estates, East Taunton, Elliot's Corner, Herring Run Estates, Linden Estates, Matthews Landing, North Taunton, Oakland, Pine Crest Estates, Pine Hill Estates, Wades Corner, [[Weir Village, Massachusetts|Weir Village]], Westville, Whittenton, Whittenton Junction, [[Britannia Village]], Willis Lake Village and Woodward Estates.  Taunton is also home to almost the entirety of the Massasoit State Park in East Taunton, and a large portion of the Hockomock Swamp Wildlife Management Area in North Taunton.

Taunton has been a hotbed area of local, [[U.S. state|state]], and national [[United States|American]] [[politics]] for centuries. Many famous political or politically-controversial events occurred in Taunton's long history. This town was the first in [[Colonial America]] where a woman ([[Elizabeth Pole]]) was credited with its founding. [[Robert Treat Paine]] was a long-time Taunton resident and a signer of the Declaration of Independence and the first Attorney-General of Massachusetts. Part of [[King Phillip's War]] was fought on Taunton's limits. 

Former [[President of the United States|U.S. presidents]], such as Presidents James K. Polk, William H. Taft, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman,  gave campaign speeches in Taunton. The city's former [[Camp Myles Standish]] during [[World War II|WWII]] was a [[prisoner-of-war camp]], a welcoming area for about a million U.S. and Allied soldiers; and a candidate site for the [[United Nations|U.N. Headquarters]], soon after the [[military camp]] closed. Although the city hasn't been as much of a hotbed of politics as it once was, it still continues to be a [[politics|politically active]] region of Massachusetts.

The city is serviced by a central public library, the Taunton Public Library, which opened in 1903 
and has undergone several expansions and renovations since that time. Also of note is the [[Old Colony Historical Society]], which archives the city and region's past.

The Taunton Green is the name of the city square. Early in its history, "The Green" was used as a training ground for militias in the [[American Revolution]]. Some say it was also the site of the historic "Liberty & Union"/"Taunton" flag raising in 1774 by the [[Sons of Liberty]], prior to the American Revolution.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Taunton%2C_Massachusetts | title=Taunton, Massachusetts | publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica 11th Edition at LoveToKnow Classic Encyclopedia | year=1911/2006 | accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref> In the 20th and 21st century, the city square was temporarily transformed during the [[winter holiday season]] into a grand display of [[Christmas]] lights, scenes, and extravagant events. This is where and how the city earned its unofficial nickname in the surrounding areas as the "Christmas City." 

"The Green" continues to provide a centralized location for city-wide Christmas activities, other holidays, events, and parades for the citizens of Taunton. A waterfall can sometimes be found at the center of the Taunton Green, although currently it is used only rarely, possibly to defray maintenance costs. 

Always to be seen flapping together in emblematic unison, the "Liberty & Union" flag and the U.S. flag fly side-by-side on the flagpole at the city's center.

==Media==
Taunton is served by several publications including the ''Silver City Bulletin'', ''[[The Taunton Call]]'', ''[[Brockton Enterprise]]'', and the ''[[Taunton Daily Gazette]]''. Regional papers of importance such as the ''[[Boston Globe]]'', ''[[Boston Herald]]'', and ''[[Providence Journal]]'', are also widely available.

Taunton has local cable television channels which include the Taunton Educational Network (channel 9), Taunton Community Access and Media, Inc. (channel 15), and Taunton Municipal Network (channel 17). Comcast's Taunton system carries all Providence and Boston stations as well and both markets are available over-the-air. The two radio stations based in Taunton are [[WPEP (AM)|WPEP 1570 AM]] and WSNE 93.3 FM, the latter of which primarily serves and has its studios in Providence.

Some of the major Internet providers in Taunton are [[Comcast]], [[EarthLink]], SBC Yahoo! Dial, and [[Verizon]]. The [[Taunton Municipal Lighting Plant]] (TMLP), Taunton's [[electric company]], is also an Internet service provider for the city and its surrounding towns.

==Healthcare and utilities==
Taunton is home to the [[Morton Hospital and Medical Center]].

Electricity is provided to residents by the Taunton Municipal Lighting Plant. Municipal water and sewer also service the city.

==Transportation==
{{seealso|Old Colony Railroad}}
The [[Taunton Branch Railroad|Taunton Railway]] began in 1838 (201 years after its founding by Elizabeth Pole from Dorchester, The [[Dorchester Company]] started in 1623 as part of the [[Sheffield Patent]] settling at Stage Point, Gloucester, Cape Anne) as the main rail transportation system both industrial and passenger connecting Taunton with points south, east, north, and west including New Bedford and Cape Cod, Fall River and Newport, Somerset and Providence, Attleboro and Providence, Mansfield and Boston, Stoughton and Boston, Raynham Middleborough and Wareham as time went on.  Taunton is the central highway hub of southeastern Massachusetts. Much of the eastern part of the state's major highways intersect and/or runs through the city, especially at its center. [[U.S. Highway 44|US 44]], [[Massachusetts Route 138|MA 138]], and [[Massachusetts Route 140|MA 140]] intersect at a square at Taunton's center, which is called the Taunton Green. MA 140 is also accessible from the eastern neighborhood of the city, popularly referred to as "East Taunton." Additionally, [[Route 24 (Massachusetts)|MA 24]] and MA 140 intersect near East Taunton, and it is at that junction that Route 140 ceases to be a 2-lane divided freeway from the south and becomes a smaller state highway to the north. [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] runs through the northern portion of Taunton, unofficially referred to as "North Taunton", and parallel to Myles Standish Industrial Park, Taunton's main industrial park.

Various smaller routes run through other parts of the city. These include a small portion of [[Massachusetts Route 104|MA 104]], close to the Taunton-Raynham city limits, and [[Massachusetts Route 79|MA 79]], close to the Taunton-Berkley-Lakeville ([[Plymouth County, Massachusetts|Plymouth County]]) city-town-county limits. Taunton is the western terminus of MA 104. It merges into US 44 after entering the city. 

Several freight rails pass through the city on their way towards Fall River, New Bedford and a link-up with the line in Middleborough. There are plans being worked on to link up parts of this rail with the Stoughton line of the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] commuter rail system to Boston. The [[Greater Attleboro Taunton Regional Transit Authority]], or GATRA, provides bus [[Public transport|mass transit]].

Taunton also has its own [[Taunton Municipal Airport|municipal airport]], serving mostly smaller craft and occasional commuter jets. The nearest airport with national airline service is at [[T.F. Green Airport]] in Rhode Island, and the nearest international service is at [[Logan International Airport]] in Boston.
