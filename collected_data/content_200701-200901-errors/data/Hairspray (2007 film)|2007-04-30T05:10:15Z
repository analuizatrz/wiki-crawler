'''''Hairspray''''' is a film adaptation of the [[musical theatre|Broadway musical]] of the [[Hairspray (musical)|same name]]. The Broadway musical was made after the [[Hairspray (film)|1988 film]]; thus the 2007 film is not technically a direct remake of the 1988 film but rather is an adaptation of the Broadway musical, which, in turn, was an adaptation of the 1988 film. The cast includes [[John Travolta]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], [[Jerry Stiller]], [[Queen Latifah]], [[Amanda Bynes]], [[Christopher Walken]], [[Allison Janney]], [[Zac Efron]], and [[Paul Dooley]]. The 2007 film is produced by Zadan/Meron Productions in the [[United States]] and will be distributed by [[New Line Cinema]].

==Plot synopsis==
In 1960s Baltimore, plump, but pleasant high school outsider Tracy Turnblad ([[Nicole Blonsky]]) attempts to break out of the boundaries set upon her by her mom Edna ([[John Travolta]]). Along with her best friend Penny Pingleton ([[Amanda Bynes]]), Tracy auditions for a part on the popular local TV program for teens, ''The Corny Collins Show''. No one is surprised more when she makes it on than Tracy herself, but her newfound popularity is quickly in jeopardy when it catches the attention of a scheming and jealous rival, the attractive Amber Von Tussle ([[Brittany Snow]]). Things turn even more dramatic when Tracy wins the heart of Amberâ€™s ex-boyfriend Link Larkin ([[Zac Efron]]). Together with her bitter TV station owner mother, and former beauty queen, Velma Von Tussle ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]), Amber attempts to destroy Tracy, get her off ''The Corny Collins Show'', and off the air for good.

The majority of the filming was done in Canada rather than Baltimore because of lower costs in Canada and because Canada was better equipped with the soundstages needed to film a musical.
