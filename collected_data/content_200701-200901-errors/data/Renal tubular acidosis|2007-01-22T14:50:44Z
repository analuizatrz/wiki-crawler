The acid-base balance of the body is regulated by the [[lungs]] and the [[kidney]]: the lungs remove [[carbon dioxide]] and the kidneys resorb filtered [[bicarbonate]] and excrete [[hydrogen ions]], to remove the daily acid load produced by [[metabolism]] of [[dietary]] [[protein]], amongst other things.

The '''renal tubular acidoses''' (RTAs) are a group of disorders in which there is a failure of the kidney to either resorb bicarbonate or excrete hydrogen ions which is unrelated to advancing [[renal failure]]. They are a cause of a [[metabolic acidosis|normal anion gap acidosis]].

==Types==
There are several different subtypes of RTA;
* Distal or type 1 RTA 
* Proximal or type 2 RTA 
* [[Hypoaldosteronism]] or type 4 RTA

===Distal RTA===
Distal RTA ('''dRTA''') is the most common and also the classical form of RTA, being the first described. It has a number of causes which cause a common underlying problem, which is a failure of acid secretion by the alpha intercalated cells of the [[cortical collecting duct]] of the distal [[nephron]].
This leads to a failure acidify the urine to a pH of less than 5.3 even if the blood is too acidic (ie there is systemic [[acidemia]]), and consequently there is a tendency towards acidemia.
This leads to the clinical features of dRTA <ref>{{cite journal |quotes= |last=Laing |first=C M |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |month=Jun |title=Renal tubular acidosis: developments in our understanding of the molecular basis. |journal=Int J Biochem Cell Biol |volume=37 |issue= 6|pages= 1151-61|id= |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=15778079&dopt=Citation}}</ref>;
*Variable metabolic [[acidosis]]/acidemia
*[[Hypokalemia]] (which may be severe)
*[[kidney stone|Urinary stone]] formation
*Nephrocalcinosis (deposition of [[calcium]] in the substance of the kidney)
*[[Bone]] demineralisation (causing [[rickets]] in children and [[osteomalacia]] in adults)

The acidosis is variable, and one may have dRTA with alpha intercalated cell failure without necessarily being acidemic, this is termed ''incomplete dRTA''. The diagnosis of dRTA can be made by the observation of a urinary pH of greater than 5.3 in the face of a systemic acidemia (usually taken to be a serum bicarbonate of 20mmol/l or less). In the case of an incomplete dRTA-failure to acidify the urine following an oral acid loading challenge is often used as a test-this is usually in the form of a short [[ammonium chloride]] test <ref> {{cite journal |quotes= |last=Wrong |first= O|authorlink= |coauthors=Davies HEF |year= 1959|month= |title=The Excretion of Acid in REnal Disease |journal=QJM |volume= 28|issue= |pages=259-313 |id= |url= |accessdate= }}</ref>, in which ammonium chloride capsules are used as the acid load.

It is worth noting that the clinical picture may be very variable, ranging from being completely [[asymptomatic]], through [[loin]] pain and [[hematuria]] from [[kidney stones]] to [[failure to thrive]] and severe [[rickets]] in childhood forms as well as possible [[renal failure]] and even [[death]].

*Autoimmune disease, classically [[Sjogren's syndrome]] but may be associated with any autoimmune disease, including [[SLE]], [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] and even [[hypergammaglobulinemia]]. Hypokalaemia is often more severe in these cases.<ref>{{cite journal |quotes= |last=Wrong |first=OM |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1993 |month= |title=Immune-related potassium-losing interstitial nephritis: a comparison with distal renal tubular acidosis |journal=QJM |volume=86 |issue=8 |pages=513-542 |id= |url=http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/86/8/513 |accessdate= }}</ref>
*Nephrocalcinosis, which may cause dRTA as well as be caused by it-due to calcium disruption of the [[cortical collecting duct]].

*[[Renal transplantation]]
*[[Sickle cell anemia]]
*Liver [[Cirrhosis]]

====Treatment====
This is relatively straightforward. It involves correction of the acidemia with oral [[sodium bicarbonate]] or [[sodium citrate]]. This will correct the acidemia and reverse bone demineralisation. Hypokalema and urinary stone formation and nephrocalcinosis can be treated with [[potassium citrate]] tablets which not only replace potassium but won't increase calcium excretion and thus exacerbate stone disease as sodium bicarbonate or citrate may do.<ref>{{cite journal |quotes= |last=Morris |first= R C|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |month= |title=Alkali Therapy In Renal Tubular Acidosis: Who Needs It? |journal=J Am Soc Nephrol |volume=13 |issue= |pages=2186â€“2188 |id= |url=http://jasn.asnjournals.org/cgi/reprint/13/8/2186.pdf |accessdate= }}</ref>

===Proximal RTA===
Proximal RTA ('''pRTA''') is caused by a failure of the [[proximal tubular]] cells to resorb filtered bicarbonate from the urine, leading to urinary bicarbonate wasting and subsequent acidemia. The distal intercalated cells function normally, so the acidemia is less severe than dRTA and the urine can acidify to a pH of less than 5.3. pRTA also has several causes, and may occasionally be present as a solitary defect, but is usually associated with a more generalised dysfunction of the proximal tubular cells called [[Fanconi's syndrome]] where there is also [[phosphaturia]], [[glycosuria]], aminoaciduria, uricosuria and tubular [[proteinuria]].
The principle feature of Fanconi's syndrome is bone demineralisation due to phosphate wasting. Correction with oral [[bicarbonate]] may exacerbate urinary potassium losses and precipitate [[hypokalemia]].

====Causes====
Familial disorders
*[[Cystinosis]]
*[[Wilson's disease]]
*[[Galactosemia]]
*[[Tyrosinemia]]
*[[Hereditary fructose intolerance]]
*[[Lowe's syndrome]]
*[[Glycogen storage disease (type I)]]

Acquired disorders
*[[Multiple myeloma]]
*[[Amyloidosis]]
*Toxins, such as [[HAART]], [[ifosfamide]],[[Lead]] and [[Cadmium]]
*[[Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria]]


====Treatment====
Again this depends on oral bicarbonate supplementation. However, this will increase urinary bicarbonate wasting and may well promote a bicarbonate [[diuresis]]. The amount of bicarbonate given may have to be very large, to stay ahead of the urinary losses. As with dRTA, reversal of the chronic acidosis should reverse bone demineralisation.<ref>{{cite journal |quotes= |last=McSherry |first=E |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1981 |month= |title=Renal tubular acidosis in childhood |journal=Kidney International |volume=20 |issue= |pages=799 |id= |url= |accessdate= }}</ref>
