The '''Pribnow box''' (also known as the '''Pribnow-Schaller box''') is the sequence ''TATAAT'' of six [[nucleotide]]s ([[thymine]]-[[adenine]]-[[thymine]]-etc.) that is an essential part of a [[promoter]] site on [[DNA]] for [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] to occur in [[prokaryote]]s. (It is similar to the [[TATA box]] promoter that occurs in [[eukaryote]]s.) The Pribnow box is located roughly 10 base pairs upstream from the site of initiation of transcription. It is considered a [[consensus sequence]] - that is, it is the most common base sequence to appear at such points on the DNA helix; there may be variations in various organisms. Since [[adenine]] and [[thymine]] pair together with only two [[hydrogen bonds]] (as opposed to three as with [[guanine]] and [[cytosine]]), they are easier to break apart, making them favourable sites for [[RNA polymerase]] to latch onto.

The '''Pribnow box''' or '''Pribnow-Schaller box''' is named after David Pribnow and Heinz Schaller.

==In fiction==
The term "Pribnow box" is used as a sort of [[jargon]] in episode 13 of ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', in reference to the chamber holding simulation [[Evangelion (mecha)|Evangelion]]s for testing purposes.
