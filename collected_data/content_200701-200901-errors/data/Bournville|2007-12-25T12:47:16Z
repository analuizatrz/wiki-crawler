[[Image:BirminghamBournvilleShops.jpg|thumbnail|right|The shops around The Green]]'''Bournville''' is an area on the south side of [[Birmingham]], [[England]], best known for its connections with the [[Cadbury]] family and [[chocolate]] - including a dark chocolate bar branded "Bournville". It is also a [[ward (politics)|ward]] within the [[Government of Birmingham, England#Districts|council constituency]] of [[Selly Oak]] and home to a campus of the [[Birmingham Institute of Art and Design]].

==History==
Originally Bournville consisted of a scattering of farmsteads and cottages linked by winding country lanes, the only visual highlight being the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] built Bournbrook Hall.

The [[Bluebell wood|bluebell glades]] of Stocks Wood were said to be a relic of the [[Forest of Arden]] and there are [[Roman Empire|Roman]] remains nearby.

==Cadbury==
In [[1879]], [[George Cadbury|George]] and [[Richard Cadbury]] moved their [[cocoa]] and chocolate factory from Bridge Street in central Birmingham to a greenfield site beside Bournbrook Hall, four miles to the south. The location was chosen as it was regarded as cleaner, healthier and more amenable to longer-term expansion plans. Although rural, it was also already serviced by a [[railway]] station and [[canal]].

The Cadburys named the area 'Bournville' after the [[Bourn Brook]]; with 'ville' being French for 'town', this set Bournville apart from the local area (some people wrongly believe Bournville was originally known as Bournbrook - [[Bournbrook]] exists to the north of Bournville). The Cadburys began to develop their factory in the new suburb. Loyal and hard-working workers were treated with great respect and relatively high wages and good working conditions; Cadbury also pioneered [[pension]] schemes, joint works committees and a full staff medical service. Indeed, the Cadburys were particularly concerned with the health of their workforce, incorporating garden areas into Bournville's plans, and encouraging [[swimming]], [[walking]] and all forms of outdoor sports.

Later, George Cadbury bought 120 acres (0.5 km²) of land close to the works and planned, at his own expense, a [[model village]] which would 'alleviate the evils of modern more cramped living conditions'. These almost '[[Arts and crafts]]' houses were traditional in design but with large gardens and modern interiors, and were designed by the resident [[architect]] [[William Alexander Harvey]]. These designs became a blueprint for many other model village estates around Britain. It is also noteworthy that, because George Cadbury was a [[Quaker]], no [[public house]]s have ever been built in Bournville.

[[Image:Bournville rest house.jpg|thumb|250px|Bournville Rest House was built to celebrate the Silver Wedding Anniversary of George and Elizabeth Cadbury, and was paid for by the employees of Cadbury Brothers Ltd. The design is by [[William Alexander Harvey]], who was architect of many of the buildings on the estate and is based on a mediaeval butter market in Dorset. Currently, the building houses the Visitors Centre for the [[Carillon]].]]

In [[1900]], the [[Bournville Village Trust]] was set up to formally control the development of the estate, independently of George Cadbury or the estate. The trust focused on providing [[school]]s, [[hospital]]s, [[museum]]s, public baths and reading rooms. As Bournville is a conservation area, another job of the Bournville Village Trust is to accept or reject plans for building extension and modification.

An almost campus feel evolved, with a triangular village green, infant and junior schools, the School of Art and the Day Continuation School (originally intended for young Cadbury employees) and a host of events such as fêtes and [[Maypole]] dances.

The trust continues to exercise an international influence on housing and town planning generally. Now containing 7,800 homes on 1,000 acres (4 km²) of land with 100 acres (0.4 km²) of parks and open spaces, Bournville remains a popular residential area of Birmingham.

[[Cadbury Schweppes]] is still one of Birmingham's main employers, making all manner of chocolate products.

The dark chocolate Bournville Plain is now manufactured in France and sold in the UK.

==Sustainability==
In 1983, the [[Bournville Village Trust]] bought 65 acres of Rowheath Park to develop as a solar village. At the time of its completion, it was the largest such development in northern Europe.

Although Bournville is most famous for its turn-of-the-20th century Cadbury style homes, a significant number of more modern stock also exists in the area - not all of which was built by Cadbury's.

[[Bryant Homes]] built a collection of upmarket and mostly detached houses in the west of Bournville during the [[1970s]].

There is a purpose built Serbian Orthodox Church known by its members as Lazarica, formally the Church of the Holy Prince Lazar. This is built in the traditional Byzantine style of the Balkans and is consciously modelled on some famous examples. The interior is decorated in the full scheme of the Orthodox Tradition with wall-paintings al fresco. The Priest in charge is under the jurisdiction of the Serbian Archbishop for Scandinavia and Great Britain and resides in Sweden, and ultimately comes under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate in Belgrade.
