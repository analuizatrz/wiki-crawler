==Lawsuit over confidential sources==

In [[1998]], [[Landmark Education]] spent months attempting to compel Steven Pressman to respond to deposition questions aimed at obtaining the confidential sources he used for research on ''Outrageous Betrayal''<ref>[http://www.rickross.com/reference/landmark/landmark193.html ''Introduction to the Landmark Education litigation archive''], [http://www.lowenstein.com/pskolnik/ Peter L. Skolnik] & [http://www.lowenstein.com/mnorwick/ Michael A. Norwick], [http://www.lowenstein.com/Home.aspx Lowenstein Sandler PC], [[Roseland, NJ]], February [[2006]] </ref>.  The suit was brought under the pretext of compelling discovery for use in the then-active [[Cult Awareness Network]] litigation.  However, Pressman concluded that the suit was brought primarily to harass him.  The discovery commissioner who entered an interim order in the matter, commented that:
<blockquote>it does not appear that the information sought [from Mr. Pressman] is directly relevant or goes to the heart of the [CAN] action, or that alternative sources have been exhausted or are inadequate.</blockquote> 
The action against Pressman was dropped after the Cult Awareness Network litigation was settled<ref>[http://www.rickross.com/groups/landmark.html#Litigation Landmark Education Litigation Archive], Section: ''Pressman''. </ref>.
