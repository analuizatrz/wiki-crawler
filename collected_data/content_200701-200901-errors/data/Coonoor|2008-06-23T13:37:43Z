== Background ==
[[Image:CoonoorTownPanaroma20070421.jpg|thumb|300px|Coonoor town panorama]]The town is the second largest in the Nilgiri hills after [[Ooty]], the district head quarters. 
Coonoor’s dominant demographic is a healthy mix of religions, languages and cultures - caused by the tourists who decide to retire here, the Indian Army’s regimental headquarters and Staff College ([[DSSC]]) in neighboring [[Wellington Cantonment]], and the local boarding schools. Economic development of the town has at best been lopsided, with very little going towards the maintenance of the town.


==Local Economy==
Coonoor's economy relies on seasonal tourist traffic during the summer months, and on the [[tea]] industry year round.  
===Tea===
[[Image:Coonoor tea plantation.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Daily wage laborers plucking [[Tea]] at a [[Tea Garden]] in Coonoor.]]
The local populace almost entirely depends on the tea trade. The massive private tea plantations that surround the hills produce fresh green tea leaves which are picked, processed and packaged in bulk in local factories, for sale at auction houses in Coonoor, [[Coimbatore]] and [[Cochin]].


===Tourism===
Sims Park is, without doubt,the star attraction of Coonoor. Spread over 12 hectares, its small enough for a  comfortable walk around and large enough to house a thousand varieties of trees, plants and flowers and a small lake.

The hills are among the more scenic spots in Tamil Nadu, and consequently attract enormous amounts of tourists during the hot Indian summer months. The town’s infrastructure often finds itself unable to handle the tourist inflow, and life turns especially chaotic when the local horticultural society holds its annual “Fruit Show” at the peak of the tourist season, hosted at Sim's Park. 

There are several scenic areas around Coonoor. Coonoor provides tourists with a panoramic view of Eastern and Western Ghats along with its ravines, valleys, and waterfalls. There are some classical viewpoints close to Coonoor notably Dolphin's Nose, Lamb's Rock and Lady Canning's Seat.

Unfortunately "Development" has overtaken the town and hillsides are disappearing under construction activity.  Some of the routes that were once quiet walks amid lush greenery have become walks among human settlements. The hill station has become a town.

===Other Industry===
[[Image:PasteurInstituteCoonoor.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pasteur Institute, 1927]]
Coonoor is home to the [[Pasteur Institute of India]] [http://mohfw.nic.in/kk/95/ib/95ib0l01.htm] which produces [[rabies]] [[vaccine]]s. 

Coonoor has some [[Sericulture]]. The Government operates a Silk Farm, though this is largely a research facility. [[Floriculture]] and strawberry cultivation are taking root of late.

Coonoor is home to Homedale Tea Factory on Tiger Hill road. This factory headed by Raman Menon makes interesting varieties of tea including silk tea and eucalyptus tea.

=== Education===
Schools are a significant contributor to the local economy. The expensive boarding (residential) schools have for nearly a century now been a feature of the Nilgiris and Coonoor. Originally modelled as British vocational training centers, these have now become comprehensive Kindergarten - Higher Secondary (K-12) schools based on the Indian (Central or State) schooling systems. The pleasant climate and utopian ideas of children growing up away from the maddening rush of life attract parents from all over the world. The schools are generally very well equipped by Indian and International standards, and mostly cater to the Indian elite. However, since most schools are also open to locals, they don't always breed elitist values. Many of these schools are owned and operated by Catholic missionaries. The reasonable availability of infrastructure allows these schools to excel in sports, unlike most other schools in India which have a very strong academic focus. These schools include:

===Nilgiri Mountain Railway===
The [[Nilgiri Mountain Railway]] is one of the oldest [[mountain railway]]s in India. The Nilgiri Mountain Railway was declared by the [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]] in July [[2005]]. This railway links Coonoor to the town of [[Mettupalayam]] at the foot of the hills. Coonoor was the original termination point of this railway, before the line was extended to Ooty.

The ardeous task of constructing the mountain railways from Mettupalayam to Ooty, was undertaken by Rao Bahadhur Bellie Gowder, the then local community leader and a Badaga, who hailed from the Hubbathalai Village. He was awarded the title of "Rao Bahadhur" and "Rao Sahib" from the British Raj. He was also known as the uncrowned king of the Nilgiris. 

This fantastic world heritige mountain railway still stands testimony to great things of the past.
