'''''Beyond Fantasy Fiction''''' was a US [[fantasy]] fiction magazine edited by [[H. L. Gold]] in 1953–1955.  During this short period, it published several significant short stories by distinguished authors, such as [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Ray Bradbury]] and [[Philip K. Dick]], and it has generally been regarded as one of the best of the many new magazines launched in the 1950s. Nevertheless, it was not a commercial success, and lasted only ten issues.<ref name=Tuck>{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H.

==History and significance==
''Beyond Fantasy Fiction'' was a fantasy-oriented companion to the more successful ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'', which launched in 1950; ''Beyond'' had been planned by editor H.L. Gold from the time ''Galaxy'' was launched, but had to wait until ''Galaxy'' was firmly established.<ref name=TM_65>{{cite book | first=Michael | last=Ashley |authorlink= Michael Ashley| title=The Time Machines: The Story of the Science-Fiction Pulp Magazines from the Beginning to 1950| publisher=Liverpool University Press | location=Liverpool| year=2000 | pages = 65–66|id=ISBN 0853237697}}</ref>  ''Beyond'''s first issue, dated July 1953, included an editorial by Gold in which he laid out the magazine's scope, excluding (in his words) only "the probably possible" and "the unentertaining".<ref name=Clute_Grant_2>{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] & [[John Grant (science fiction writer)|Grant, John]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Fantasy| origdate= 1997| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press]], Inc. | location= New York| pages= 110}}</ref><ref name=issues>See the individual issues.

The quality of the fiction remained high throughout the magazine's life,<ref name=Tuck /> with appearances from many well-known authors, and the magazine is often cited as being the successor to the unusual fantasy tradition of ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown]]''.<ref name=Clute_Grant_1>Mike Ashley comments that ''Beyond'' "is generally acknowledged as the natural successor to Unknown". {{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] & [[John Grant (science fiction writer)|Grant, John]]| title= [[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]| origdate= 1997|publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| pages= 110}}</ref>  Author [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]] said of the new fantasy magazines that appeared in the 1950s that "the best of these was ''Beyond'', created by Horace Gold as a companion fantasy magazine to ''Galaxy'', which he had created three years before. ''Beyond Fantasy Fiction'' aimed at the same rationalized fantasy niche that ''Unknown'' had established and to which Gold had contributed stories."<ref name=Gunn_TWH>{{cite web |url = http://fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook9337.htm | author= [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]] | title = Introduction to The Witching Hour| publisher = [[Fictionwise]] eBooks}}</ref>

The magazine was not commercially successful: at that time circulation figures were not required to be published annually, as they were later,<ref name=ASF_1965>See for example the statement of circulation in {{cite journal | year = 1965 | month = December | title = Statement Required by the Act of October 23, 1962 | journal = Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact | volume = LXXVI | issue = 4 | pages = 161}}</ref> so the actual circulation figures are not known. It lasted less than two years, its demise caused in part by the decreasing popularity of fantasy and horror fiction.<ref name=TM_65/> 

A typical issue of ''Beyond'' included a couple of stories that were long enough to be listed as [[novella]]s or [[novelette]]s, with the contents filled out with shorter stories, usually to at least seven or eight total stories.  Several significant or widely-reprinted stories appeared during ''Beyond'''s short history:<ref name=Tuck_stories>All but the Gunn and PKD stories are included by Tuck in his list of "Notable fiction" from ''Beyond''.  The Gunn is mentioned as a classic in Clute/Grant ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]''; see {{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] & [[John Grant (science fiction writer)|Grant, John]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Fantasy| origdate= 1997|publisher= [[St. Martin's Press]]| location= New York| pages=p. 110}}  Dick's story is included because of his current prominence; see the Tuck ''Encyclopedia'' entry cited above.</ref>

The [[Hugo Award]]s, which were first voted on in 1953, did not initially honour short fiction; and ''Beyond'' received no awards in the other categories, such as Best Magazine.  However, the 2004 [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]] awarded "[[Hugo Award#Retro Hugos|Retro Hugos]]", or retroactive Hugo Awards; again, ''Beyond'' was not represented among the winners, but two stories appeared as runners-up: Sturgeon's "...And My Fear Is Great..." placed third in the novella category, and Cogswell's "The Wall Around the World" placed fifth in the novelette category.  In addition, Gold placed fifth in the editor category, though this recognized his work at ''Galaxy'' as well as at ''Beyond''.<ref name=retro_54>{{cite web | url = http://www.nesfa.org/data/LL/Hugos/hugos1954.html | title = The Long List of Retro Hugo Awards, 1954}}</ref>

Other writers who appeared in the magazine included [[Jerome Bixby]], [[John Wyndham]], [[James Gunn (author)|James E. Gunn]], [[Fredric Brown]], [[Frederik Pohl]], both under his own name and with [[Lester del Rey]] under the joint pseudonym "Charles Satterfield", [[Philip José Farmer]], [[Randall Garrett]], [[Zenna Henderson]], and [[Algis Budrys]].<ref name=issues />  ''Beyond'''s selection of stories has been described by the historian of sf [[Michael Ashley]] as "seeking to achieve [...] high quality fantasy fiction acceptable to all readers"; he adds that ''Beyond'' was more successful than ''[[Fantastic Science Fiction]]'', a competitor in this niche, because Gold "had a clearer vision and was more determined ... to achieve it ... despite sales problems, Gold persisted in publishing fiction that sought to stretch the boundaries of imagination."<ref name=TM_65/>

Five of the ten covers were [[Surrealism|surrealist]], which was an unusual artistic choice for a genre magazine.  The cover painting for the first issue was by [[Richard M. Powers]]; Gold was one of the very few American magazine editors to use his work, though Powers was prolific in the paperback field.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?Richard%20Powers | title = Richard Powers: Summary Bibliography | publisher= [[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]]}} The Nicholls ''Encyclopedia of SF'' states that Powers' Surrealist style was "unique in sf" and notes that he did few magazine covers, working mainly for book publishers. {{cite book|author = [[Jon Gustafson]] and [[Peter Nicholls]] |chapter = POWERS, RICHARD M. | editor= Nicholls, Peter & [[John Clute|Clute, John]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993|publisher= [[St. Martin's Press]]| location= New York| pages= p. 952}}</ref>  In addition to Powers, René Vidmer and Arthur Krusz (among others) contributed cover art.<ref name=issues />  The magazine carried interior artwork for almost every story throughout its life, usually including multiple illustrations for each story.  The best-known interior artist ''Beyond'' used was [[Ed Emshwiller]], though there were several other regulars.<ref name=issues />

Every story in ''Beyond'' included a facsimile of the author's signature, set at the end of the story.  The magazine carried almost no non-fiction, though there were occasional "filler" pieces to fill spaces at the end of stories.  There were no book reviews, and only the first issue carried an editorial.<ref name=issues />

==Bibliographic details==
[[Image:BeyondFantasyFictionMar54.jpg|thumb|March 1954 issue of ''Beyond Fantasy Fiction''.  Cover art by Scott Templar.]] The publisher was Galaxy Publishing Corporation, New York.  The magazine was initially titled ''Beyond Fantasy Fiction'', and this remained the title on the masthead throughout the ten-issue run.  However, issue 9 changed the title to simply '''''Beyond Fiction''''' on the cover, spine, and table of contents.  Issue 10 used the new, shorter title on the cover and spine, but reverted to ''Beyond Fantasy Fiction'' for the table of contents.  As a result the magazine is often listed as having changed its name for the last two issues.<ref name=issues /><ref name=Tuck />

The magazine began as a 160-page [[Digest size|digest]], priced at 35 cents.  The price stayed the same throughout the run, but the page count was cut to 128 for the eighth issue, September 1954.  The magazine was bimonthly, but issues 9 and 10 did not carry month and year dates, which has led different bibliographers to catalogue them in different ways.  However, the masthead for these issues indicates that the magazine remained bimonthly, and so they are now usually catalogued as November 1954 and January 1955, respectively; the copyright dates on the last two issues correspond to these dates.  The volume numbering was completely regular; volume 1 had six numbers, and volume 2 ceased with its fourth number.  The stories were printed in the two-column format usual to digest magazines.<ref name=issues /><ref name=Tuck />  

A British edition of the magazine ran for four issues.  These copied the first four issues of the US version, with slightly cut contents; they were numbered 1 to 4.  They were not dated, but appeared on a bimonthly schedule starting in November 1953 and finishing in May 1954.<ref name=Clute_Grant_2 /><ref name=Tuck />

Nine stories from the magazine were collected into the 160-page paperback ''Beyond'', published in 1963 by [[Berkley Books]] (F712) and edited by Thomas Dardis (who was not credited on the book).<ref name=Clute_Grant_2 />

Used copies of the magazine were not particularly rare as of 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://used.addall.com/SuperRare/RefineRare.fcgi?id=070827184445511953&inTitle=Beyond+Fantasy+Fiction+1953 | title = AddALL Rare Used and Out of Print Book Search | accessmonthday=29 August| accessyear = 2007}}</ref>
