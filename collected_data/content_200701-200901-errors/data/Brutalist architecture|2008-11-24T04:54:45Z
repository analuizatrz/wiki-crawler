The term '''Brutalist Architecture''' originates from the [[France|French]] ''[[béton brut]]'', or "raw concrete", a term used by [[Le Corbusier]] to describe his choice of material. The Brutalist style of architecture spawned from the [[Modern architecture|modernist architectural]] movement and which flourished from the 1950s to the mid 1970s.  In 1954, the English architects [[Alison and Peter Smithson]] coined the term, but it gained currency  when the British architectural critic [[Reyner Banham]] used it in the title of his 1966 book, "The New Brutalism", to identify the emerging style.<ref>Golan 2003, [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0422/is_2_85/ai_104208984/pg_3 p.3].</ref>

==Style==
{{Unreferencedsection|date=July 2008}}
Brutalist buildings usually are formed with striking repetitive angular geometries, and where [[concrete]] is used often revealing the texture of the wooden forms used for the in-situ casting.  Although concrete is the material most widely associated with Brutalist architecture, not all Brutalist buildings are formed from concrete.  Instead, a building may achieve its Brutalist quality through a rough, blocky appearance, and the expression of its structural materials, forms, and (in some cases) services on its exterior.  For example, many of [[Alison and Peter Smithson]]'s private houses are built from brick. Brutalist building materials also include brick, glass, steel, rough-hewn stone, and [[gabion]] (also known as trapion). Conversely, not all buildings exhibiting an exposed concrete exterior can be considered Brutalist, and may belong to one of a range of architectural styles including [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]], [[International style (architecture)|International Style]], [[Expressionist architecture|Expressionism]], [[Post-modern architecture|Postmodernism]] and [[Deconstructivism]].

Another common theme in Brutalist designs is the exposure of the building's functions—ranging from their structure and services to their human use—in the exterior of the building.  In the [[Boston City Hall]] (''illustration left''), designed in 1962, strikingly different and projected portions of the building indicate the special nature of the rooms behind those walls, such as the mayor's office or the city council chambers. From another perspective of this theme, the design of the [[Hunstanton School]] included placing the facility's water tank,  normally a hidden service feature, in a prominently placed and visible tower. 

Brutalism as an architectural style also was associated with a social [[utopian]] ideology, which tended to be supported by its designers, especially [[Alison and Peter Smithson]], near the height of the style.  Critics argue that this abstract nature of Brutalism makes the style unfriendly and uncommunicative, instead of being integrating and protective, as its proponents intended. Brutalism also is criticised as disregarding the social, historic, and architectural environment of its surroundings, making the introduction of such structures in existing developed areas appear starkly out of place and alien.  The failure of positive communities to form early on in some Brutalist structures, possibly due to the larger processes of [[urban decay]] that set in after [[World War II]] (especially in the [[United Kingdom]]), led to the combined unpopularity of both the ideology and the architectural style.

The architectural style known as '''Brutalism''' and the architectural and urban theory known as '''New Brutalism''' may be regarded as two different movements, although the terms are often used interchangeably. The New Brutalism of the English members of [[Team 10]], [[Alison and Peter Smithson]], is more related to the theoretical reform of the [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne|CIAM]] (in architecture and urbanism) than to "béton brut". [[Reyner Banham]] formulated this difference in the title of his book: "The New Brutalism - Ethic or Aesthetic?"

The best known early Brutalist architecture is the work of the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[architect]] [[Le Corbusier]], in particular his [[Unité d'Habitation]] (1952) and the 1953 Secretariat Building in [[Chandigarh]], [[India]].

==History==

[[Image:Park Hill close-up.JPG|right|thumb|[[Park Hill, Sheffield|Park Hill]] (detail), Sheffield. Lynn, Smith 1961]]
Brutalism gained considerable momentum in [[Great Britain]] during the middle twentieth century, as economically depressed (and [[World War II]]-ravaged) communities sought inexpensive construction and design methods for low-cost housing, shopping centres, and government buildings. Nonetheless, many architects chose the Brutalist style even when they had large budgets, as they appreciated the 'honesty', the sculptural qualities, and perhaps, the uncompromising, anti-bourgeois, nature of the style.

Combined with the socially [[progressivism|progressive]] intentions behind Brutalist "streets in the sky" housings such as Corbusier's ''Unité'', Brutalism was promoted as a positive option for forward-moving, modern urban housing. In practice, however, many of the buildings built in this style lacked many of the community-serving features of Corbusier's vision, and instead, developed into claustrophobic, crime-ridden tenements. [[Robin Hood Gardens]] is a particularly notorious example, although the worst of its problems have been overcome in recent years. Some such buildings took decades to develop into positive communities. The rough coolness of concrete lost its appeal under a damp and gray northern sky, and its fortress-like material, touted as vandal-proof, soon proved vulnerable to spray-can [[graffiti]].

==Campus Brutalism==
In the late 1960s, many campuses in North America were undergoing expansions and, as a result, there are a significant number of Brutalist buildings at American and Canadian universities, beginning with [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]]'s 1958 [[Yale Art and Architecture Building]]. Rudolph's design for the [[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth]] is an example of an entire campus designed from scratch in the Brutalist style. Likewise, architect [[Walter Netsch]] designed the entire University of Illinois-Chicago Circle Campus (now the East Campus of the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]) under a single, unified brutalist design.  The original "inner ring" of buildings at the [[University of California, Irvine]] was designed by a team of architects led by [[William Pereira]] in what he called a "California Brutalist" style.<ref>{{cite website | title=Anteater Chronicles: William Pereria, Architect | year=2006 | publisher=University of California, Irvine Library | url=http://www.lib.uci.edu/ucihistory/index.php?page=architecture&function=pereira }}</ref> 

Examples outside of the U.S. include [[McLennan Library]], [[Burnside Hall]] and the Stephen Leacock building at [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]], the South Building at [[University of Toronto at Mississauga]], [[Robarts Library]] at the [[University of Toronto]], significant parts of [[York University]] in Toronto, the Aula of [[Delft University]] in [[The Netherlands]] (1966), [[Rand Afrikaans University]] (1967) in Johannesburg, South Africa. In [[New Zealand]] the [[University of Canterbury]].   In the United Kingdom, the Charles Wilson Building of the University of Leicester, [[Churchill College, Cambridge]] (1962-8) and [[Dunelm House]], [[University of Durham]] (1965), the [[University of York]] (1963), [[Oberlin College]] [[Mudd Library]] are all notable examples.

== Criticism and reception ==
Brutalism has some severe critics, one of the most famous being [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], whose speeches and writings on architecture have excoriated Brutalism, calling many of the structures "piles of concrete". "You have to give this much to the Luftwaffe," said Prince Charles at the Corporation of London Planning and Communication Committee's annual dinner at Mansion House in December 1987. "When it knocked down our buildings, it didn't replace them with anything more offensive than rubble."<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2004/may/17/architecture.regeneration</ref> Much of the criticism comes not only from the designs of the buildings, but also from the fact that concrete façades don't age well in a damp, cloudy [[maritime climate]] such as that of northwestern Europe, becoming streaked with water stains and sometimes, even with [[moss]] and [[lichen]]s.

At the [[University of Oregon]] campus, outrage and vocal distaste for Brutalism led, in part, to the hiring of [[Christopher Alexander]] and the initiation of [[The Oregon Experiment]] in the late 1970s. This led to the development of Alexander's ''[[A Pattern Language]]'' and ''[[A Timeless Way of Building]]''.

The current [[Fodor's|Fodor's guide]] to London mentions the former [[Home Office]] building at [[50 Queen Anne's Gate]] as "hulking."{{citequote}}  Because the style is essentially that of poured concrete, it tends to be inexpensive to build and maintain, but very difficult to modify. 

In recent years, the bad memories of under-served Brutalist community structures have led to their [[demolition]] in communities eager to make way for newer, more traditionally-oriented community structures. Despite a nascent modernist appreciation movement, and the identified success that some of this style's offspring have had, many others have been or are, slated to be demolished.

The architecture column of ''[[Private Eye]]'', "Nooks and Corners", began life as "Nooks and Corners of the New Barbarism", with "new Barbarism" clearly intended as a reference to "new Brutalism".{{fact|date=August 2007}} The column sometimes is skeptical about modern architecture in general, but over the course of some four decades, has been uniformly, vehemently, critical of Brutalism, especially in government-sponsored projects.{{fact|date=August 2007}}

==Resurgence==

Although the Brutalist movement was largely dead by the mid-1980s, having largely given way to [[Structural Expressionism]] and [[Deconstructivism]], it has experienced an updating of sorts in recent years. Many of the rougher aspects of the style have been softened in newer buildings, with concrete façades often being [[sandblasting|sandblasted]] to create a stone-like surface, covered in [[stucco]], or composed of patterned, pre-cast elements. Many modernist architects such as [[Steven Ehrlich]], [[Ricardo Legorreta]], and [[Gin Wong]] have been doing just that in many of their recent projects. The firm of [[Victor Gruen|Victor Gruen and Associates]] has revamped the style for the many courthouse buildings it has been contracted to design. Architects from [[Latin America]] have been reviving the style on a smaller scale in recent years. Brutalism has recently experienced a major revival in [[Israel]], due to the perceived sense of strength and security the style creates. With the development of [[LiTraCon]]&mdash;a form of translucent concrete&mdash;a new Brutalist movement may be on the horizon.

Even in Britain, where the style was most prevalent, and later most reviled, a number of buildings recently (as of 2006) have appeared in an updated Brutalist style, including [[deRijke Marsh Morgan]]'s 1 Centaur Street in [[Lambeth]], London, and [[Elder & Cannon]]'s The Icon in [[Glasgow]] in Scotland.  The 2005 [[Stirling Prize]] shortlist contained a number of buildings (most notably [[Zaha Hadid]]'s [[BMW]] factory and the eventual winner, [[Enric Miralles]]' [[Scottish Parliament Building]]) featuring significant amounts of exposed concrete, something that would have been regarded as aesthetically unacceptable when the prize was inaugurated nine years previously.  There also has been a reappraisal of first-generation Brutalist architecture and a growing appreciation that dislike of the buildings often stems from poor maintenance and social problems resulting from poor management, rather than the designs. In 2005 the British television channel [[Channel 4]] ran a documentary, ''[[I Love Carbuncles]]'', which placed the U.K.'s Brutalist legacy in a more positive light.  Some Brutalist buildings have been granted [[Listed Building|listed]] status as historic and others, such as [[Gillespie, Kidd and Coia]]'s [[St. Peter's Seminary]], named by ''[[Prospect (architecture magazine)|Prospect]]'' magazine's survey of architects as Scotland's greatest post-war building, have been the subject of conservation campaigns.  The [[Twentieth Century Society]] (headed, ironically, by [[Gavin Stamp]], ''Private Eye's'' "Nooks & Corners" columnist 'Piloti') has campaigned against the demolition of buildings such as the [[Tricorn Centre]] and [[Trinity Centre Multi-Storey Car Park]].

==Figures==

Architects associated with the Brutalist style include [[Ernő Goldfinger]], husband-and-wife pairing [[Alison and Peter Smithson]], and, to a lesser extent perhaps, Sir [[Denys Lasdun]]. Outside of Britain, [[Louis Kahn]]'s government buildings in Asia and [[John Andrews]]'s government and institutional structures in Australia exhibit the creative height of the style. [[Paul Rudolph]] is another noted Brutalist, as is [[Ralph Rapson]] both from the United States.  [[Marcel Breuer]] was known for his "soft" approach to the style, often using curves rather than corners. More recent Modernists such as [[I.M. Pei]] and [[Tadao Ando]] also have designed notable Brutalist works. In Brazil, the style is associated with the [[Paulista School]] and is evident in the works of [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]]-winning architect [[Paulo Mendes da Rocha]] (2006).
