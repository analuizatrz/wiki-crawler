{{Campaignbox Vietnam War}}
The '''Tet Offensive''' ([[January 30]], [[1968]] &ndash; [[June 8]], [[1968]]) was a series of offensives by the ''[[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|Việt Cộng]]'' and the [[Vietnam People's Army|North Vietnamese Army]] during the Vietnam War. 

The operations are called the Tet Offensive as they were timed to begin on the night of January 30&ndash;31, 1968, ''[[Tết|Tết Nguyên Đán]]'' (the [[lunar new year]] day).  The offensive began spectacularly during celebrations of the Lunar New Year and lasted about two months, although some sporadic operations associated with the offensive continued into 1969.

==Summary==
 
The Tet offensive was a country-wide coordinated surprise attack by the NVA and VC on more than 100 towns and cities, including 36 provincial capitals and Saigon. The attack, at the time, was the largest battle of the war. The Viet Cong (VC) and North Vietnamese Army (NVA) struck nearly simultaneously, during the most sacred Vietnamese holiday while many [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) troops were on leave. Initially the attacks took the South Vietnamese and Americans by surprise, but they were beaten back by the ARVN and the Americans, inflicting massive casualties on the Viet Cong.
The offensive included attacks on the city of Hue, where intense fighting lasted a month, at the U.S. base at Khe Sanh, where fighting continued for 2 months, and the raid on the U.S Embassy in Saigon, which was repulsed within a few hours. It is widely seen as a turning point in the war, but although it was a military defeat for the communists, it was misreported back home in america, where the TVs showed the Americans retreating through the grounds of the US embassy in Saigon, so it had a profound psychlogical impact on the United States.

====Goals and results====
According to General Vo Nguyen Giap, the communist north's goals were not purely military but political and diplomatic as well, to take advantage of public opposition to the war in the United States and the weakness of the Saigon Government.  Giap sought to accomplish the following:

* Create a general uprising among the South Vietnamese against the Saigon government, leading to the formation of a coalition government and the departure of the United States.

* Demonstrate that American claims regarding progress in the war were wrong and to apply pressure upon the U.S. government.

* Bring the war to the cities of South Vietnam to relieve military pressure on the countryside. (Schmitz 90)

The first and most ambitious goal, to produce a general uprising, was a failure for the communists. While there was little support for the Saigon government, there was no general uprising and the communists, most with no plans for retreat or withdrawal, took heavy losses. While fighting in Hue and Saigon continued for some time, in most cites the communists were driven back in just days.

The effort to regain control of the countryside was more successful. According to the U.S. State Department the Viet Cong "expanded their control in urban areas and have made pacification virtually inoperative. In the Mekong Delta the NLF was stronger now then ever and in other regions the countryside belongs to the VC" (Schmitz 106), 
 
The attacks created a crisis in the administration of President [[Lyndon Johnson]], which was unable to convince the American people that the Tet Offensive was a major defeat for the communists. According to Colonel Thomas Hammes, the U.S. government "had squandered its credibility with the press and, through them, with the U.S. public." According to a March 25 Harris poll, 60 percent of Americans “regarded the Tet Offensive as a defeat for U.S. objectives in Vietnam (Henkin)

The offensive had profound psychological impact on the Johnson administration, elite decision makers, and the media. According to  Peter Braestrup, Tet “affected political Washington far more than it did the general public.

At the end of March, in the wake of Tet, the Johnson administration began a reevaluation of its war policy. On the advice of the so-called [[The Wise Men#Vietnam war era|Wise men]]  the Johnson Administration made major changes to its Vietnam War policy. These changes included limiting the bombing campaign in North Vietnam and reversing the escalation of American troops, capping levels at 550,000. The Johnson administration also began to turn over responsibility of the fighting to the South Vietnamese and sought negotiations with Hanoi.

==Strategic context==
[[Image:Captain Franklin P. Eller during TET NAM.jpg|right|thumb|[[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] [[Captain (military)|Captain]] Franklin P. Eller during the Tet Offensive.]]
The strategy of North Vietnam and the Viet Cong in South Vietnam was based on the Maoist theory of people's war. This theory divides warfare into three phases. In the first phase, the guerrillas gain the support of the population through the distribution of propaganda and attacks on the machinery of government. In the second phase, escalating attacks are made on the government's military and vital institutions. In the third phase, conventional fighting is used to seize cities, overthrow the government, and take control of the country. Under military leader and theorist Vo Nguyen Giap. Giap's "Peoples War, Peoples Army" closely follows the Maoist three-stage approach, but with greater emphasis on flexible shifting between mobile and guerrilla warfare, and opportunities for a spontaneous "General Uprising" of the masses in conjunction with guerrilla forces. (Hammes 52) Mao summed up the essence of this strategy as: enemy advances, we withdraw - enemy rests, we harass - enemy tires, we attack,- enemy withdraws, we pursue. (Hammes 46)

On March 8, 1965, 3,500 United States Marines became the first American combat troops to land in South Vietnam, adding to the 25,000 U.S. military advisors already in place, and four days later President Johnson announced the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam would be increased from 75,000 to 125,000. The involvement of U.S. ground forces did not greatly change the strategy of the communists. The communists did however make major changes in tactics to cope with the United States large advantage in mobility and firepower. Shifting between the three phases as circumstances dictated, the conflict turned into small-unit battles between regular army units on both sides. While artillery and air-power inflicted losses on the Viet Cong,  these losses were  made up with replacements from North Vietnam. According to the [[National Security Council]] ,in 1967 three fourth of the battles in South Vietnam were at the communists choice of time, place type and duration. The [[CIA]] reported that "less then one percent of nearly two million Allied small unit operations resulted in contact with the VC. (Schmitz 48)

The fighting in Vietnam in 1966 was described by war corespondent [[Moshe Dayan]], according to [[Martin van Creveld]] as: “[Its] battle procedures operated like an assembly belt. First came the shelling of the landing zones by ground artillery. Then came aerial bombardment. And the landings themselves were covered by ‘gunships,’ [i.e., armed helicopters] firing their rockets and machine guns almost at our feet.” It was an amazing operation, “but where was the war?... Where were the Viet Cong? And where was the battle?” [http://bostonreview.net/BR30.1/vancreveld.html The Blemish of Conquest]

From 1965 to 1967 involved an ever greater commitment of forces in the name of stabilizing the situation in Vietnam. The war was fought with two goals, to weaken the insurgency in the countryside and a battle of attrition, to inflict heavier casualties on the Vietcong and North Vietnamese than could be replaced. The military measured the success of the battle on "body counts", number of weapons seized and bombing targets destroyed as a metric for progress in the destruction of the insurgency. US strategy for dealing with North Vietnam was to use bombing to pressure the country out of the conflict and to draw the North Vietnamese into unequal conventional battles such as the Battle of Khe Sanh.

General Westmoreland and other high level commanders sought to weaken the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese to the point that the ARVN could fight unassisted. By the spring 1967 Westmoreland believed that the "crossover point" had been reached, that is that the VC and NVA were only able to maintain but not increase the size of the forces in South Vietnam. The CIA analyst in May 1967 however stated that "the Vietnamese Communists have continued to expand their Main Forces, both by infiltration and by local recruitment." (In Retrospect R. McNamara)

==The plan==
The plan for the Tet Offensive originated in 1967, following the death of North Vietnamese General [[Nguyen Chi Thanh]]. The primary strategist was Thanh's successor, General [[Vo Nguyen Giap]], although Giap claimed afterward to have been against the idea, planning it "reluctantly under duress from the [[Le Duan]] dominated Politburo."<ref>

Giap had long advocated primarily using guerrilla tactics against the U.S. and South Vietnam, whereas Thanh had supported general main force action. Overriding Giap, the North Vietnamese leadership decided that the time was ripe for a major conventional offensive. They believed that the South Vietnamese government and the U.S. presence were so unpopular in the South that a broad-based attack would spark a spontaneous uprising of the South Vietnamese population, which, if the offensive was successful, would enable the North to sweep to a quick, decisive victory. Even if unsuccessful they believed the offensive would improve the political situation of the north.

To this end, a multiphase plan was developed: in the first phase, the [[NVA]] would launch attacks in the border regions of [[South Vietnam]] to close those regions to observation, conceal troop movements and distract the enemy. Following this, a second phase of widely dispersed attacks by the Viet Cong directly into the major centers of the country would cause the collapse of the government and would prod the civilians into full-fledged revolt, and with the government overthrown, the Americans and other allied forces would have no choice but to evacuate, leading to phase three attacks by the Viet Cong and NVA against elements of the isolated foreign forces.

The offensive involved simultaneous military action in most of the larger cities in South Vietnam and attacks on major U.S. bases, with particular efforts focused on the cities of Saigon and Hue. Concurrently, a substantial assault was launched against the U.S. firebase at [[Khe Sanh]]. The Khe Sanh assault drew North Vietnamese forces away from the offensive into the cities, but North Vietnam considered the attack necessary to protect their supply lines and divert American attention.

==ARVN and U.S. readiness==
In the days immediately preceding the Offensive, the preparedness of both the ARVN and the U.S. military were relatively relaxed. North Vietnam had announced in October that it would observe a seven-day truce from January 27 to February 3, 1968, in honor of the Tet holiday, and the South Vietnamese army made plans to allow recreational leave for a large part of its force. Westmoreland requested that the South Vietnamese cancel the upcoming cease-fire and issued a warning to U.S. forces "Troops will be placed on maximum alert...." (James Arnold) However that alert either came too late or was ignored.

U.S. and ARVN military intelligence observed signs of a major military buildup in the months before the Offensive. In addition to captured intelligence, observations of [[logistics]] operations were also quite clear: In October the number of trucks observed heading south on the [[Ho Chi Minh trail|Hồ Chí Minh Trail]] jumped from the previous monthly average of 480 to 1,116. In November this number was 3,823 and in December, 6,315.<ref>

U.S. attention was firmly focused on the ongoing battle at Khe Sanh, and concluded it was the target of this buildup. U.S. intelligence identified at least 15,000 NVA troops in the vicinity, and [[Military Assistance Command Vietnam]] (MACV) staff was certain that a decisive clash was imminent, but thought it would be directed solely against Khe Sanh.

General Westmoreland warned President Johnson of the possibility of a major offensive, probably against [[Khe Sanh]], and considered analogous to the famed Vietnamese attacks at [[Dien Bien Phu|Điện Biên Phủ]] in the 1950s, which had preceded scheduled negotiations as a means of improving the Communist bargaining position. While military intelligence saw that offensive operations were being planned, it did not detect that the offensive would be national in scale and aimed at cities.

Lieutenant General Weyand, suspected a build-up and asked Westmoreland to shift forces closer to Saigon. When the Offensive began 27 maneuver battalions  were available for the defense of Saigon.

====Order of Battle Controversy====
Prior to the Tet Offensive there was disagreement between MACV's and the CIA's Order of Battle estimates of the strength of guerrilla forces in South Vietnam. While members of the intelligence community believed that VC numbers in South Vietnam could be as high a 500,000 or more, MACV held that the number could be no more then 300,000. MACV's numbers may have been lower because of political pressure to show progress in the war. Just prior to the Tet Offensive MACV refused to accept higher estimates because it would undermine claims that a crossover point had been reached. Gen Westmoreland and others were under pressure from the Johnson administration to show progress in the war to shore up  declining public support in the United States. However as the Tet Offensive approached more and more officials, both inside outside the military became increasing uneasy. In September 1967 the CIA's George Carver, under intense political pressure relented and accepted MACV's lower numbers [https://www.cia.gov/csi/books/vietnam/epis3.html CIA Center for the Study of Intelligence] 

This controversy  resurfaced when Westmorland filed a lawsuit against CBS News for the program The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam Deception, which aired on 23 January 1982. It was also the subject of the Sam Adams book, War of Numbers.

==Specific operations==

 [[Image:Tet-Offensive-Map.jpg|right|thumb|330px|Map of South Vietnam showing some of the major targets of the Tet Offensive. Also shown is Khe Sanh, where the attack predated Tet.]]
The first battles of the Tet Offensive, according to some war historians, were the battles at [[Battle of Loc Ninh 1967|Loc Ninh]], on Oct 29th, [[Battle of Dak To|Dak To]] on Nov 23rd, and the build up at Khe Sanh in January. These attacks may have been designed to draw U.S. units out of urban areas towards the northern borders. They may also have served the purpose of training the VC in urban warefare (Arnold) 
The Tet Offensive was coordinated between [[battalion]] strength elements of the [[National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam|National Liberation Front's]] People's Liberation Armed Forces (PLAF or [[Viet Cong]]) and [[Division (military)|divisional]] strength elements of [[North Vietnamese Army]] (NVA), against [[South Vietnam|South Vietnam's]] [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN), and  [[United States military]] and other ARVN-allied forces. Fighting began in the south on January 29 as a number of Viet Cong units attacked prematurely in four provincial towns. The rest of the NLF/NVA attacks began on the night of January 30. All but eight provincial capitals, five of the six autonomous cities, and 58 other major towns were attacked, with major attacks aimed at [[Ban Me Thuot]], [[Quang Nam|Quảng Nam province]], [[Dalat|Đà Lạt]], [[My Tho|Mỹ Tho]], [[Can Tho|Cần Thơ]], [[Ben Tre Province|Bến Tre province]], [[Nha Trang]], and [[Kontum]]. It was in [[Huế]], the ancient capital, and [[Saigon]] that the Communist forces had significant success.

===Khe Sanh===
:''Main article'': [[Battle of Khe Sanh]]

Khe Sanh was an airstrip and U.S. Marine base just south of the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]]. According to North Vietnam leadership, the attack on Khe Sanh, which began on January 21, was intended to serve two purposes: As a diversionary tactic to draw American attention and forces away from the upcoming Tet attacks, and to prevent the forces at Khe Sanh from attacking supplies and troops moving south on the Hồ Chí Minh Trail. In turn, American military stated that the very purpose of the Khe Sanh base was to provoke the North Vietnamese into focused and prolonged battle, allowing American artillery and air strikes to inflict massive casualties.

Khe Sanh and its 6,000 men were surrounded by 3 NVA divisions, totaling approximately 20,000 men. Throughout the battle, which lasted until April 8, the Marines were subjected to heavy artillery bombardment, combined with sporadic small-scale infantry attacks. There was never any major ground assault on the base, and the battle was largely a duel between American and NVA gunners, combined with air strikes from the American side. American air support eventually included massive bombing by [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]]s to destroy NVA trenches and bunkers. Ground supply to the base was cut off, and airborne resupply became difficult due to enemy fire. Thanks to innovative high-speed "supply assaults" using fighter-bombers in combination with helicopters, and the U.S. Air Force's use of [[C-130 Hercules]] cargo transport aircraft to employ the [[LAPES]] tactic, air supply was never halted.

American media covered the battle extensively and often made pessimistic comparisons to the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]], where a French base had been besieged and ultimately defeated by the Vietnamese in the [[Indochina Wars#The First Indochina War|1946-1954 Indochina War]].

In the end, the NVA broke off their assault, and both sides would claim that the battle had served its intended purpose. The United States estimated 8,000 NVA dead and considerably more wounded, against 730 American lives lost and another 2,642 wounded.<ref>

As with the Vietnam War in general, the loss of American lives  left a much greater impression upon the American public than did a military victory that could only be measured in terms of "kill ratio." The fact that the Khe Sanh base was abandoned on June 23 of 1968, having been deemed of no further military value, inevitably encouraged this sense of futility about the battle and the overall war.

The Siege of Khe Sanh was a diversion designed to distract American attention from the impending Tet Offensive. As [[Stanley Karnow]] noted, "Westmoreland fell for the enemy ruse."<ref>  Karnow, Stanley. ''Vietnam: A History.'' New York, NY. Penguin, 1991, pg. 555.</ref> On the eve of Tet, Westmoreland deployed his forces to repel an attack in the northern provinces. The commander of Khe Sanh, Major General [[Lowell English]], called the battle "a trap ... to force you into the expenditure of absolutely unreasonable amounts of men and materiel to defend a piece of terrain that wasn't worth a damn."<ref> ''Ibid.'' pg. 555</ref> In post-war interviews, Communist officers acknowledeged that their intent had indeed been to draw U.S. forces away from the cities.<ref> ''Ibid.'' pg. 554.</ref>

the Communists did not seek a total takeover of the city. Rather, they had six primary targets within the city: the headquarters of the ARVN, President Thieu's office, the American Embassy, the [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base]], the Long Binh Naval Headquarters, and the National Radio Station. A total of 35 battalions attacked these targets; many of these troops being undercover Viet Cong who lived and worked in the city.

The radio station was considered an important target by the Communists. They had brought a tape recording of [[Hồ Chí Minh]] announcing the liberation of [[Saigon]] and calling for a "General Uprising." The building was taken and held for six hours, but they were unable to broadcast as the power had been cut off as soon as the station was attacked.

By early February, the Communist high command realized that none of their military objectives were being met, and they halted any further attacks on fortified positions. Sporadic fighting continued in Saigon until March 7. Some sections of the city were left badly damaged by the combat, particularly by U.S. retaliatory air and artillery strikes. The Chinese district of Cholon suffered especially, with perhaps hundreds of civilians killed in American counterattacks.<ref>

===Huế===
{{main|Battle of Hue|Massacre at Huế}}

The city of [[Huế]] was attacked by ten NVA battalions and six Viet Cong battalions and almost completely overrun.  Thousands of civilians believed to be potentially hostile to Communist control, including government officials, religious figures, and expatriate residents, were executed in what became known as the Massacre at Huế. The city was not recaptured by the U.S. and ARVN forces until the end of February. Due to the historical and cultural value of the city, the U.S. did not apply air and artillery strikes as widely as in other cities, at least initially. Instead, [[U.S. Marines]] of the [[1st Marine Division]] and several Army units had to clear the city street by street and house by house; a deadly form of combat the U.S. military had hardly seen since WW II, and for which the soldiers were not trained. Over most of February, they gradually fought their way towards the Citadel, a fortified 3-square-mile section of the city, which was recaptured from NVA troops after four days of struggle. The U.S. lost 216 men and the ARVN 384. The allies estimated the NVA lost 8,000 in the city and in fighting in the surrounding area.<ref>

Lasting 26 days, Huế was one of the longest and perhaps the bloodiest single battle of the Vietnam War. The extent of the massacre of civilians by the Communists was only realized over the following months and years, with the last mass graves being found in 1970. Approximately 2,800 bodies were found, and another 2,000 persons were missing.<ref>

Some thousands of additional lives were lost from civilians being caught in the crossfire of the battle.

In the aftermath of Tet, the Communist command described the battle of Huế as "an overall success." Their unapologetic description of the massacre of civilians was ''"[[Huế]] was a place where reactionary [i.e., anti-communist] spirit had existed for over ten years. However, it took us only a short time to drain it to its root."''<ref>

===Effect on the Viet Cong and North Vietnam===
According to David Schmitz "The Tet Offensive demonstrated that the United States could not win a limited war of attrition in Vietnam and had to change policy. In these terms, Tet was, in fact, a defeat. (Schmitz 165)

However to defend from the attacks on urban areas U.S and ARVN forces withdrew from the countryside allowing the communist to increase control there. According to the U.S. State Department the move into rural areas "was an integral part of the communist plan" (Schmtz). This resulted in "a bad setback for the pacification effort" according to James Arnold (Arnold)

According to Michael Lee Lanning and Dan Cragg, Inside the VC and the NVA, one-third of the men in VC units were North Vietnamese.  General Wheeler, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  reported that the Tet Offensive had brought counterinsurgency programs to a halt and "that to a large extent, the VC now controlled the countryside."  [[John Paul Vann]], according to [[Peter Brush]], "felt Westmoreland had been duped by army briefers who over-stressed enemy body counts as a measure of success. Vann wrote in March 1968 that the VC were "being given more freedom to intimidate the rural population than ever before in the past two-and-a-half years." [http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/central/brush/LocalForces.htm] However, this change had little effect on the war, since North Vietnam had little difficulty making up the casualties inflicted by the war.<ref>

The National Liberation Front (the political arm of the Viet Cong) reformed itself as the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam, and took part in future [[Paris Peace Accords|peace negotiations]] under this name.

For example, the attack on the U.S. Embassy was allocated only 9 Viet Cong soldiers, and even the expenditure of this force was considered by some VC officers to be misguided. Only after they saw how the U.S. was reacting to this attack did the Communists begin to propagandize it. The timing of the Offensive was determined by the hope that American and South Vietnamese forces would be less vigilant during the Tet holiday.

===Effect on South Vietnam===
The violence witnessed during the Tet Offensive had a deep psychological effect on the South Vietnamese civilians. Confidence in the government was greatly reduced, as the offensive seemed to show that even with massive American support, the government could not protect its citizens. The South Vietnamese army also suffered lowered morale, with the desertion rate increasing from 10.5 per thousand before Tet to 16.5 per thousand in July of 1968<ref>

The songwriter [[Trịnh Công Sơn]] composed the songs ''Bài ca dành cho những xác người'' (''Song for the dead bodies'') and ''Hát trên những xác người'' (''Singing on dead bodies'') as a result of the offensive while the songwriter [[Trầm Tử Thiêng]] composed ''Chuyện một chiếc cầu đã gãy'' (''Story about a Broken Bridge'') about the collapse of the historic [[Trang Tien Bridge]].  These songs quickly became classics.

===Effect on the United States===
Although US public opinion polls continued to show a majority supporting involvement in the war, this support continued to deteriorate and the nation became increasingly polarized over the war.[18] President Lyndon Johnson saw his popularity fall sharply after the Offensive, and he withdrew as a candidate for re-election in March of 1968. The Tet Offensive is frequently seen as an example of the value of media influence and popular opinion in the pursuit of military objectives. That the Communists were able to mount a major, country-wide assault at all was a blow to U.S. hopes of winning the war rapidly, and starkly called into question General Westmoreland's earlier public reports of progress in the War. Likewise, the optimistic assessments of the Johnson administration and The Pentagon came under heavy criticism and ridicule.

====Troop Request====

On the 9th of February  Westmoreland wrote Wheeler "I would welcome reinforcements at any time they can be made available" to be able to "go on the offensive as soon as his attack is spent" Wheeler however  told Johnson that the ARVN may not withstand further attacks. On the 12th of February Westmorland's requests became more urgent: "I must reinforce from other areas and accept a major risk, unless I can get reinforcements, which I desperately need." Westmoreland believed that he could not assist ARVN in defense of the cites and Khesanh as well. (Schmitz 105)
These request caused confusion within the White house and on the 20th of Feb Lyndon Johnson sent Gen. Wheeler to Vietnam to determine Westmoreland's military requirements to respond to the Offensive. Wheeler's written report contained Westmoreland's request for 206,003 additional troops. According to Wheeler's report, that in spite of heavy loses  North Vietnam and Viet Cong forces were "operating with relative freedom in the countryside" and that South Vietnamese forces were in a "defensive posture around towns and cities," Wheeler's report stated that the additional troops were needed to "counter the enemy offensive", to restore security in the cities, towns and countryside and to "regain the initiative through offensive operations". 

=====The Turning point=====
According to the [[Pentagon Papers]] "A fork in the road had been reached. Now the alternatives stood out in stark reality. To accept and meet General Wheeler's request for troops would mean a total U.S. military commitment to SVN--an Americanization of the war, a callup of reserve forces, vastly increased expenditures. To deny the request for troops, or to attempt to again cut it to a size which could be sustained by the thinly stretched active forces, would just as surely signify that an upper limit to the U.S. military commitment in SVN had been reached." [http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon4/pent11.htm The Pentagon Papers Gravel Edition Volume 4 Chapter 2, "U.S. Ground Strategy and Force Deployments,]

To evaluate Westmoreland's request and its possible impact on domestic politics Johnson convened a task force on Vietnam. Johnson also called for a complete "A to K" reassessment. This reassessment included the CIAs assessment that: "They (the communists) certainly were not desperate or fearful of early collapse. A reconsideration of their capabilities to succeed in a long war may have been a contributing factor. And they probably regarded the balance of forces as sufficiently favorable to warrant a major and widespread offensive. The fact of Presidential elections in the US may have influenced their decision, and, of course, the tactical advantage of the Tet truce played a role in the immediate timing. In any case, it does not appear that they undertook the present offensive because they had concluded that protracted conflict was no longer feasible for them."[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/frus/johnsonlb/vi/13695.htm U.S State Department Policy Reassessment and the "A to K" Review]

Clifford Task Force  members Rostow, Wheeler, and Taylor argued that the Offensive was  "a desperate attempt to seize cities and promote popular uprisings" and  represented an opportunity to defeat the North Vietnamese on the United States terms. (Hoopes) Members Nitze, Warnke and Katzenbach on the other hand argued that neither side could win militarily, that North Vietnam could match any troop increase  and it was time to seek a negotiated settlement.

While this was being deliberated, the request was leaked to the press and published across three columns of the Sunday edition of ''[[The New York Times]]'' on [[March 10]], [[1968]]. The article, written by [[Neil Sheehan]] and [[Hedrick Smith]], reveled that the request had started a debate within the administration. According to the article many high-level officials believed that the increase would be matched by the communists and would lead to a stalemate at a higher level of violence. The article also stated that officials were saying in private that "widespread and deep changes in attitudes, a sense that a watershed has been reached"

Then-[[Lieutenant Colonel]] Dave Palmer later wrote in ''Summons of the Trumpet'': "Looked upon erroneously but understandably by readers as a desperate move to avert defeat, news of the request for 206,000 men confirmed the suspicions of many that the result of the Tet Offensive had not been depicted accurately by the President or his spokesmen. If the Communists had suffered such a grievous setback, why would we need to increase our forces by 40 percent?"<ref>

Clark Clifford also pointed out the same dilemma. At a meeting with Johnson and McNamara he said "There is a very strange contradiction in what we are saying and doing. On one hand, we are saying that we have known of this build up. We now know the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong launched this type of effort in the cities. We have publicly told the American people that the communist offensive was: (a) not a victory, (b) produced no uprising among the Vietnamese in support of the enemy, and (c) cost the enemy between 2,000 and 5,000 of his combat troops.
Now our reaction to all of that is to say that the situation is more dangerous today than it was before all of this. We are saying that we need more troops, that we need more ammunition and that we need to call up the reserves."

===Controversy===

===Results and impact of the Offensive===
The Tet Offensive is widely seen as the turning point of the war. While the Offensive is often viewed as a military defeat for the communists it had profound psychological, political and economic impact on the United States.

The impact of the Tet Offensive in the United States and on the Vietnam War remains a controversial subject. According to one view, the Tet Offensive was an overwhelming victory for the United States in which the VC and NVA were militarily crushed but was mis-reported by the media as an American defeat. 
 
====Media lost the war viewpoint====

The Tet Offensive is  considered a military defeat for the Communist forces by some. Cited in support of this view is the fact the Offensive did not create an uprising in South Vietnam and the operational cost of the offensive was dangerously high, with the Viet Cong essentially crippled by the huge losses inflicted by South Vietnamese and other Allied forces. The Offensive is widely considered a turning point of the war in Vietnam, with the NLF and NVA winning an enormous psychological and [[propaganda]] victory.  
The Viet Cong's operational forces were effectively crippled by the Offensive. Many Viet Cong who had been operating under cover in the cities of South Vietnam revealed themselves during the Offensive and were killed or captured. The organization was preserved for propaganda purposes, but in practical terms the Viet Cong were finished. Formations that were referred to as Viet Cong were in fact largely filled with North Vietnamese replacements. 

According to [[Col Thomas X. Hammes|Colonel Hammes]], Tet is sometimes viewed as one of a series of victories won by the United States however the press "turned these victories into a political defeat. The argument is that Tet "should have been a victory in itself and a serious strategic setback for the communist. Further, the continued U.S. and ARVN  successes against the Viet Cong and NVA should have sealed our (United States) victory rather than seen the erosion of support. Instead, according to this view, the Communist actually gained strength because of inaccurate reporting by the U.S. and international press. According to this thesis, the inaccurate reporting heavily contributed to the destruction of Americans will to fight" (Hammes  70).

Cited in support for this view is the well known report by [[Walter Cronkite]], called by some a "Cronkite Moment" The famous Eddie Adams's photograph as well as editorials in major newspapers. Television reporting is also credited for bringing the horror of war into the living rooms of the United States. It is widely believed that the media portrayal then caused the public to turn against the war. This view is held by many in the military and some political conservatives in the United States. To this day, the Tet Offensive is cited as an example of the important role of the political and psychological aspects of warfare.

====Criticism of viewpoint ====

The opposing major view is that the strength of VC and NVA demonstrated by the Tet offensive revealed that statements by United States senior military and Johnson administration regarding progress in the war were untrue.
This view, that the war had reached a stalemate and caused the Johnson administration to reevaluate reports of the war's progress. Specifically [[Robert Komer]] reported to [[Ellsworth Bunker]] that the pacification program ([[CORDS]]) now had 68% of SVN population was under control of Saigon while 17% was under control of NLF. (schmitz p 56) MACV reported that as of the end of 1967 the communist were "unable to mount a major offensive". General Bruce Palmer reported that "the Viet Cong has been defeated" and that "He can't get food and he can't recruit. He has been forced to change his strategy from trying to control the people on the coast to trying to survive in the mountains." (Schmitz p 58)

In spite of this, public support in the United States continued to decline. In October of 1967 for the first time a plurality of Americans thought the war was a mistake. To shore up public support Johnson brought Westmoreland back to the United States to assure the public that progress was being made which led to the  statement that a point in the conflict had been reached "where the end comes into view." According to this view the reevaluation of the war by senior members of the Johnson administration to evaluate Westmorelands request for additional troops during the Tet offensive was resulted in the end of the escalation phase of the war. Supporters of this view cite McNamara's resignation, [[Clark Clifford]] and [[The Wise Men]] advice to Johnson that the war was unwinnable and the United States should take steps to disengage and seek a political solution. This view holds that this reevaluation caused the Johnson administration to conclude that the war had reached a stalemate. This view is held by some Vietnam War historians and others.

Although US public opinion polls continued to show a majority supporting involvement in the war, this support continued to deteriorate and the nation became increasingly polarized over the war.<ref>

[[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon Johnson]] saw his popularity fall sharply after the Offensive, losing support of both hawks and doves and he withdrew as a candidate for re-election in March of 1968. While the Tet Offensive is frequently seen as an example of the value of [[Mass media|media]] influence and popular opinion in the pursuit of military objectives, James Arnold wrote "At the time, political and military leaders from Johnson and Westmoreland down blamed the Press for losing the war. The effort continued for years thereafter as discredited leaders sought to recover prestige. But their carping obscures the fact already described that even with a fully muzzled Press America had no viable war-winning strategy" 

That the Communists were able to mount a major, country-wide assault at all was a blow to U.S. hopes of winning the war rapidly, and starkly called into question General Westmoreland's earlier public reports of progress in the War. Likewise, the optimistic assessments of the Johnson administration and the [[Pentagon]] came under heavy criticism and ridicule. Stanley Karnow noted that "a West Point textbook on the war ... attributed the 'complete surprise' achieved by the Communists to a U.S. 'intelligence failure ranking with Pearl Harbor.'"<ref>  Karnow, Stanley. ''Vietnam: A History.'' New York, NY. Penguin, 1991, pg. 556; also see Witz, James. ''The Tet Offensive: Intelligence Failure in War.'' Ithaca, NY. Cornell University Press, 1991, ppg. 1-2.</ref>

====Media impact====
Many people, both at the time and in retrospect, have criticized the U.S media for the negative light in which it portrayed both the war in general and the Tet Offensive in particular. [[Earle Wheeler]], then [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], complained of "all the doom and gloom we see in the U.S. press" after Tet. General Westmoreland would later write: "The war still could have been brought to a favorable end following the defeat of the enemy’s Tet Offensive. But this was not to be. Press and television had created an aura, not of victory, but defeat."<ref>  

Ironically, it was Westmoreland's press briefings that focused the media's attention on the siege at Khe Sanh and diverted it from the impending offensive. The American press was shocked as much by the Tet Offensive, as by the fact that the country's leading soldier had been outmaneuvered. Only a few months previously, Westmoreland had told Congress that the end of the war was in sight.

"Even when we won, such as the Tet Offensive, the press put a negative spin on it and we appeared to lose."</ref>

Some conservative authors have accused the press of being responsible for losing the war. For example, in ''Certain Victory: How Hanoi Won The War'', Dennis Warner writes "This is the only war lost in the columns of The [[New York Times]]. They created an image of South Vietnam that was as distant from the truth as not even to be a good caricature. There were those who invented, distorted, and lied."<ref>

One of the most commonly cited works on the media is ''Big Story'', by [[Peter Braestrup]], a former Marine infantry officer and reporter for The [[Washington Post]] during the Tet Offensive. Braestrup analyzed press coverage of the Tet offensive and concluded that the press misreported the offensive as a defeat for the U.S. and that the reporting amounted to a "portrait of defeat".<ref>

Probably the most well-known example of an anti-war statement in the press is [[Walter Cronkite]]'s special report on the war of [[February 27]], [[1968]]. After returning from a two week tour of Vietnam in which he "met with American and South Vietnamese officials, toured the country and reported from ongoing battles in Hue and other places" (Schmitz p 110) he returned to New York where directly criticized the military leadership and the Johnson administration: "We have been too often disappointed by the optimism of the American leaders, both in Vietnam and Washington, to have faith any longer in the silver linings they find in the darkest cloud."  He concluded by saying that the U.S. was "mired in a stalemate" and called for a negotiated end to the conflict.<ref>

This was in contrast to his first report in Saigon where he reported that "The Viet Cong suffered a military defeat (Schmitz p 111)

=====Studies of media impact on public opinion=====
[[Daniel Hallin]] and [[Clarence Wyatt]] also studied the effect of the media on public opinion. They found virtually no evidence to support any causal relationship between editorial tone and bias in the media with loss of public support for the war.<ref>

Hallin maintains that there was in fact a shift in the tone of coverage during and after Tet, but this change was a reflection of the shift in the opinions of elite decisions makers in the United States.<ref>

Professor [[John Mueller]] also studied the effects of the media on public opinion during the Korean and Vietnam conflicts. He found no relationship between the media and popular support but linked support to casualty levels.

Army historian [[William Hammond]], considered an authority on military and media relations concluded that there was little evidence showing a link between media coverage and popular support. Hammond wrote "that press reports were... more accurate than the public statements of the administration in portraying the situation in Vietnam." But by 1968, the charge that the press lost Vietnam had become an article of faith to many Vietnam veterans. In fact, it had been General Westmoreland's rosy military predictions to the press and his inability to predict the Tet Offensive that undercut public support. Many journalists stationed in Saigon felt betrayed by him for not anticipating events and for wrongly guiding the lens of the media on to Khe Sanh. "The battle dragged on for two months ..." writes Stanley Karnow, "becoming almost daily fare for American television viewers ...."<ref> Karnow, Stanley. ''Vietnam: A History.'' New York, NY. Penguin, 1991, pg. 552, ISBN 0-670-84218-4hc</ref>

====Impact on domestic politics in the United States====
As the Johnson Administration deepened U.S. involvement in Vietnam, questions arose about the veracity of government pronouncements.<ref>

In November 1967, in response to  mass protests at the Pentagon the month before, President Johnson started a public relations campaign to convince the public that the United States was winning the war. Johnson stated that the war would last "not many more nights."  General Westmoreland told the National Press Club that a point in the conflict had been reached "where the end comes into view."<ref>

But as James Witz commented, Tet "contradicted the claims of progress ... made by the Johnson Administration and the military."<ref>

After Tet, President Johnson continued to claim the war was going well for the United States. His credibility was undermined however by the leak of  Westmoreland's request for 206,000  additional troops just two days before the [[United States Democratic Party]] [[New Hampshire Primary]]. President Johnson suffered a unexpected setback in the primary, finishing barely ahead of [[United States Senator]] [[Eugene McCarthy]].  Soon after, Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] announced he would join the contest for the Democratic nomination, further emphasizing the plummeting support for Johnson's Administration in the wake of Tet. On March 31, Johnson announced he would not seek reelection, and announced a halt to the bombing of North Vietnam.

Also in March of 1968, Johnson announced that General Westmoreland would be replacing General Harold K. Johnson as [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]]. Although technically a promotion, few doubted that Westmoreland was being "kicked upstairs" in response to Tet.<ref>
