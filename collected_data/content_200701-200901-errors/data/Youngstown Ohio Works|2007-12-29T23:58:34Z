The '''Youngstown Ohio Works''' baseball team was a [[minor league baseball|minor league]] club that was known for winning the premier championship of the [[Ohio-Pennsylvania League|Ohio–Pennsylvania League]] in 1905,<ref name="ohio-pa-1905">{{cite web | url = http://www.sabr.org/sabr.cfm?a=cms,c,412,5,0 | first = Jim | last = Holl | title = Ohio-Pennsylvania League of 1905 | publisher = Society for American Baseball Research | accessdate = 2007-03-04}}</ref> and for launching the professional career of [[pitcher]] [[Roy Castleton]] a year later.<ref name="Society for American Baseball Research ">{{cite web | url = http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&pid=2264&bid=1194 | first = Craig | last = Lammers | title = Roy Castleton  | publisher = Society for American Baseball Research | accessdate = 2007-03-08}}</ref> A training ground for several players and officials who later established careers in [[major league baseball]], the team proved a formidable regional competitor and also won the 1906 league championship. 

During its brief span of activity, the Ohio Works team faced challenges that reflected common difficulties within the Ohio-Pennsylvania League, including weak financial support for teams.<ref name="sp217">''Spalding's Official Athletic Library Baseball Guide'' (New York: American Sports Publishing Co., 1910), p. 217.</ref> Following a dispute over funding, the team's owners sold the club to outside investors, just a few months before the opening of the 1907 season.<ref name="baseball-reference">{{cite web | url = http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Ohio-Pennsylvania_League | title = Ohio-Pennsylvania League | publisher = Baseball Reference | accessdate = 2007-10-10}}</ref>

The club's strong record and regional visibility spurred the growth of amateur and minor league baseball in the Youngstown area, and the community's minor league teams produced notable players throughout the first half of the 20th century.<ref name="Landolf">{{cite news

The team opened the 1905 season with an unexpected 4&ndash;1 loss to the Canton Protectives, inspiring a local newspaper to comment that the Youngstown team made "as many errors as hits while Canton fielded almost perfectly and hit opportunely".<ref name="vind-yo-05-03-1905">

Competition among league participants was intense, and games were often raucous affairs. On [[July 16]], [[1905]], a riot broke out during a contest with a team in neighboring Niles, Ohio. According to a newspaper account, the trouble began when two female fans became involved in a "hair-pulling fight". At one point, two "well-known men" were arrested for "taking an umbrella from a woman and breaking it after she had been annoying them with it". Finally, dozens of fans swarmed into the field, where they "pushed around the umpire and interfered with the defensive play of the Youngstown fielders".<ref name="vind-yo-04-11-99">

In September 1905, the Youngstown Ohio Works won the first league championship, though sources disagree on the club's final record. This confusion may be due to the disorganized nature of the new league, with its sprawling roster of teams.<ref name="ohio-pa-1905">{{cite web | url = http://www.sabr.org/sabr.cfm?a=cms,c,412,5,0 | title = Ohio–Pennsylvania League of 1905 | publisher = Society for American Baseball Research | accessdate = 2007-03-04}}</ref> According to the ''Spalding Guide'' (1906), "The failure to furnish official reports was probably due to the clubs being new to a league".<ref name="sp289">''Spalding's Official Athletic Library Baseball Guide'' (New York: American Sports Publishing Co., 1906), p. 289.</ref> Baseball researcher Jim Holl summarizes the varied accounts as follows: "''The Reach Guide'' (1906) credits Youngstown with an 84–32 won–lost record where the ''Spalding Guide'' of the same year list a 90–35 record.

== Final season ==
[[Image:castleton.jpg|thumb|right|112px|Roy Castleton]]
By the outset of the 1906 season, the Ohio–Pennsylvania League had trimmed down to a more manageable eight teams. Departing teams included franchises from Barberton, Braddock, Bucyrus, Butler, Canton, Homestead, Kent, Lima, Massillon, McKeesport, Mount Vernon, Niles, Steubenville, Washington, and Wooster. At the same time, the league attracted new teams from [[New Castle, Pennsylvania]], and [[Mansfield, Ohio]].<ref name="Society for American Baseball Research"/>  

Early in the season, as the Ohio Works team prepared for a second game with the Zanesville Moguls (close rivals in the 1905 championship games),<ref name="sp289">''Spalding's Official Athletic Library Baseball Guide'' (New York: American Sports Publishing Co., 1906), p. 289.</ref> the club manager, Hogan, spoke confidently on their chances of capturing the league pennant. "If the boys go through the season as they are playing now, we will have no trouble winning out", he said to a reporter with ''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator''. "Our pitchers are in good condition and are holding the opposing batsmen to few hits. It is the pitching staff that has saved many a game for us. We have no .350 batters on the club, but any man on it is liable to step in and break up a game".<ref name="vindy-yo-06-19-06"/> A local newspaper confirmed Hogan's assessment of the team, observing that only one player, outfielder Will Thomas, had worked up a [[batting average]] of .306.<ref name="vindy-yo-06-25-1906">{{cite news
  | title = Fielding Is Improved; Batting Not So Strong
  | work = The Youngstown Vindicator

}}</ref> Nevertheless, as Hogan predicted, the team defeated the Moguls, with a final score of 11&ndash;8. The game's highlights included the pitching of "Long John" Kennedy, who kept the Moguls to seven hits, and the batting of Edward Hilley, who "unloosened a drive to middle field that permitted him to go all the way around".<ref name="vindy-yo-06-21-1906">{{cite news

Hogan's overall confidence in the club was rewarded.

[[Image:zsignal.jpg|thumb|left|110px|''Zanesville Signal'', February 18, 1907]]
Despite the club's apparent success, disagreements over funding led to its sale and relocation. On [[February 18]], [[1907]], the ''Zanesville Signal'' reported that Hogan had received permission from "the Messrs. McDonald" (Joseph McDonald and brother Thomas G. McDonald) to negotiate a $3,000 deal for the sale of the team, including its players, to a group of Zanesville investors.<ref name="Zanesville-signal">{{cite news

The ball club manager's evident frustration during this period was reflected in comments published in ''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator'' almost a week after the team's sale. When questioned on his widely publicized decision to resign as manager of the Youngstown club before the opening of the 1907 season, Hogan reportedly said that he had received "the short end of the deal".<ref name="vindy-yo-2-24-07">{{cite news

The former Ohio Works manager was apparently not the only observer to suggest that Joseph McDonald engaged in "unsportsmanlike tactics".<ref name="vindy-yo-05-02-20">{{cite news
  | title = Youngstown's Old Circus Grounds
  | work = The Youngstown Vindicator

Meanwhile, former Ohio Works players in Zanesville struggled to regain their previous momentum. At the close of the 1907 season, the Zanesville club placed a lackluster third in the eight-team [[Pennsylvania-Ohio-Maryland League]], a Division D league that enjoyed far less prestige than the Ohio&ndash;Pennsylvania League.<ref name="POM">{{cite web | url = http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Pennsylvania-Ohio-Maryland_League | title = Pennsylvania-Ohio-Maryland League | publisher = Baseball Reference | accessdate = 2007-12-08}}</ref> In 1908, Hogan's final season as manager, the team was christened as the [[Zanesville Infants]] and joined the [[Central League]].<ref name="central">{{cite web | url = http://www.ballparkwatch.com/leagues/central_league.htm  | title = Central League | publisher = BallParkWatch | accessdate = 2007-03-12}}</ref> Further research is needed to determine the Zanesville Infants' league ranking at the close of the 1908 season, but available information shows that the team neither won the championship nor placed as a runner-up.<ref name="central">{{cite web | url = http://www.ballparkwatch.com/leagues/central_league.htm  | title = Central League | publisher = BallParkWatch | accessdate = 2007-03-12}}</ref>

With the notable exception of Castleton, the progress of former Ohio Works players is difficult to track. Much is known about their ex-manager's subsequent career, however. In 1909, Hogan moved to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he signed future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] pitcher [[Stan Coveleski]] to his first professional contract.<ref name="roy">{{cite web | url = http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&pid=2264&bid=1194 | first = Craig | last = Lammers | title = Roy Castleton | publisher = Society for American Baseball Research | accessdate = 2007-03-04}}</ref> In 1909, the [[Lancaster Red Roses]] worked up a 75-39 record,<ref name="rose">{{cite web | url = http://www.lancasterhistory.org/collections/exhibitions/Baseball/baseball5.htm | title = 1906-1914: A Rose by Any Other Name | publisher = Lancaster County Historical Society | accessdate = 2007-03-04}}</ref> seizing the championship of the [[Tri-State League]].<ref name="sp181">''Spalding's Official Athletic Library Baseball Guide'' (New York: American Sports Publishing Co., 1910), p. 181.</ref> As ''Spalding's Baseball Guide'' (1910) reported: "Lancaster, under manager Marty Hogan, won its first pennant in the league, and the top rung of the ladder was only gained by the hardest kind of fighting".<ref name="sp181">''Spalding's Official Athletic Library Baseball Guide'' (New York: American Sports Publishing Co., 1910), p. 181.</ref> The following year, however, the Red Roses' performance fell short of the previous season when it placed second, with 63 wins and 47 losses.<ref name="rose2">{{cite web | url = http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Lancaster_%28PA%29_Red_Roses| title = BR-Bullpen Page on Lancaster Red Roses| publisher = Baseball.Reference.com | accessdate = 2007-08-17}}</ref> Then, in 1911, Hogan's last year as manager of the Lancaster team, the club placed a disappointing fourth in the eight-team league,<ref name="rose2"/> with 54 wins and losses, respectively.<ref name="rose"/> 

Hogan went on to manage clubs in Zanesville and [[Fond Du Lac, Wisconsin]].<ref name="nyt-07-20-13">

In 1913, during a stint in Zanesville, the manager signed pitcher [[Sad Sam Jones|Sam Jones]] to his first professional contract.<ref name="roy"/> Apart from such highlights, however, Hogan's later career as a minor league baseball manager proved uneven when compared to his record as manager of the Youngstown Ohio Works. In the mid-1910s, he permanently resettled in Youngstown, where he helped to organize the Youngstown Gun Club and became athletic director of Thomas Field, a ballpark owned by the local Brier Hill Industrial Works. Hogan died in Youngstown in 1923, several months after being injured in an automobile accident.<ref name="vindy-yo-08-17-23">{{cite news

The Youngstown Ohio Works team not only gave pitcher Roy Castleton a prized "shot" at the major leagues, but it also played an indirect role in launching the career of [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] umpire [[Billy Evans]]. On [[September 1]], [[1903]], Evans, a reporter at ''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator'', was assigned to cover a game between the Ohio Works and the Homestead Library Athletic Club that was held in Youngstown. Evans took his first step toward a legendary career when club manager Hogan offered him $15 to fill an umpire vacancy.<ref name="baker">{{cite news

The story of the Ohio Works team proved to be an early chapter in Youngstown's long history of amateur and minor league baseball. In the 1930s and 1940s, the city was a frequent host of the National Amateur Baseball Federation (NABF) championship.
