'''''69 Love Songs''''' is a three-volume [[concept album]] by [[The Magnetic Fields]]. As its title suggests, the album is composed of [[69 (number)|69]] love songs, all written by Magnetic Fields frontman [[Stephin Merritt]]. The album was released in 1999 in the [[United States]] (as a box set with Merritt interview booklet, and as three separate individual volumes), and in 2000 in [[Europe]] and [[Australia]] (box set without booklet).

==Conception==
The album was originally conceived as a grandiose musical revue. Stephin Merritt was sitting in a gay piano bar in Manhattan, listening to the pianist's interpretations of [[Stephen Sondheim]] songs, when he decided he ought to get into theatre music because he felt he had an aptitude for it. "I decided I'd write one hundred love songs as a way of introducing myself to the world. Then I realized how long that would be. So I settled on sixty-nine. I'd have a theatrical revue with four [[drag queen]]s. And whoever the audience liked best at the end of the night would get paid."<ref>[http://www.sfbg.com/Guides/Noise993/index.html Interview] in the ''[[San Francisco Bay Guardian]]'', 1 September 1999</ref>

==Genres and themes==
The variety of ''69 Love Songs'' also derives from the many song genres that Merritt raids and filters through his own gay miserablist sensibility. Merritt has said "''69 Love Songs'' is not remotely an album about love. It's an album about love songs, which are very far away from anything to do with love.".<ref>[http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/music/features/article270522.ece Interview] in ''[[The Independent]]'', 14 April 2000</ref> Some of the genres are obvious, as in the songs "[[Punk rock|Punk]] Love", "Love is Like [[Jazz]]", "World Love" and "Wi' Nae Wee Bairn Ye'll Me Beget". Other songs indirectly reference some of Merritt's favourite artists, including [[Fleetwood Mac]] ("No One Will Ever Love You") [http://www.slate.com/id/2097404/], [[Cole Porter]] ("Zebra"), [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] ("Let's Pretend We're Bunny Rabbits"), [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]] ("When My Boy Walks Down the Street"), [[Billie Holiday]] ("My Only Friend"), and [[Irving Berlin]] ("A Pretty Girl is Like...").{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

Another way of understanding ''69 Love Songs'' is through Merritt's praise of an artist ([[Laurie Anderson]]) who "write[s] heartbreaking melodies with words that make fun of heartbreaking melodies."<ref>Liner notes to 69 Love Songs</ref> Consider "Yeah! Oh, Yeah!" where Stephin and Claudia, playing jilted lovers modeled closely on [[Sonny & Cher]], sing their complaints to one another, overplaying and overstating their grievances such that their words become garish declarations of woe ("what a dark and dreary life / are you reaching for a knife?") to which the other character isn't really capable of responding but must still follow in tone ("yeah, oh yeah"). The lack of a firm distinction between content (what is sung) and form (the way it is sung) implies that this couple lives and dies by virtue of how persuasively they can sing to one another, and illustrates the persistent Magnetic Fields songwriting device of trapping a character within the conventions or formalities of a genre.

Several of the songs bend genders as well as genres. For example: a male vocal sings "He's going to be my wife" ("When My Boy Walks Down the Street") and "the princess there is me" (Long-Forgotten Fairytale"); female vocals sing "bring me back my girl" ("Acoustic Guitar"). Other common themes include place names (e.g. [[Washington, DC]]; [[Lower East Side]]; [[North Carolina]]; [[Paris]]; [[Venice]]), animals (e.g. [[bear]], [[goldfish]], [[jellyfish]], [[rabbit]], [[bat]], [[dog]], [[boa (genus)|boa constrictor]], [[cockroach]]), as well as themes common throughout Merritt's work (e.g. the moon, dancing, rain, and eyes).
