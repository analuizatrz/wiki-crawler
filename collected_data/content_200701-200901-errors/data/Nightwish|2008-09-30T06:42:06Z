'''Nightwish''' is a [[Finns|Finnish]] <!-- Please see the talk page before changing -->[[Heavy metal|metal]] band,<ref>{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com | work=Photobook | url=http://nightwish.com/en/photobook | accessmonthday=August 29 | accessyear=2008}}</ref> formed in 1996 in the town of [[Kitee]], [[Finland]]. Nightwish is considered one of the bands responsible for the creation of the [[symphonic metal]] subgenre [[symphonic metal#Symphonic power metal|symphonic power metal]].<ref>[http://www.amvlyrics.com/amv/nightwish/ AMV Lyrics]</ref>

Although they have been prominent in their home country since the release of their first [[Single (music)|single]], “[[The Carpenter]]” (1997) and debut album ''[[Angels Fall First]]'', they did not achieve worldwide fame until the release of the albums ''[[Oceanborn]]'', ''[[Wishmaster (album)|Wishmaster]]'' and ''[[Century Child]]'', which were released in 1998, 2000 and 2002 respectively. Their 2004 album, ''[[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]]'', which sold more than 1 million copies,<ref name="dpprelease">{{cite web | title=Spinefarm | work=Nightwish | url=http://www.spinefarm.fi/showband.php?id=1 | accessmonthday=September 5 | accessyear=2008}}</ref> led to Nightwish video clips being shown on [[MTV]] in the [[United States]] and inclusion of their music in US movie soundtracks. Their biggest US hit single, “[[Wish I Had an Angel]]” (2004), made it onto three US film soundtracks as a means to promote their North American tour.<ref name="imdb">{{cite web | title=IMDb | work=Nightwish | url=http://imdb.com/name/nm1743752/ | accessmonthday=June 17 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> The band produced three more singles and two music videos for the album, as well as “[[Sleeping Sun]]”, from the 2005 “[[Greatest hits|best of]]” compilation album, ''[[Highest Hopes]]'', prior to vocalist [[Tarja Turunen]]’s dismissal.

In May 2007, former [[Alyson Avenue]] frontwoman, Swede [[Anette Olzon]], was revealed as [[Tarja Turunen|Turunen]]’s replacement,<ref name="blabber">{{cite web | title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET | work=NIGHTWISH Announces New Singer | url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=73176 | accessmonthday=June 17 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> and in the autumn, the band released a new album ''[[Dark Passion Play]]''.<ref name="dpprelease">{{cite web | title=Nightwish – The Official Website | work=The Band – Discography.

== History ==
===''Nightwish demo'' (1996)===

Based on the musical experimentations of Holopainen, the original band concept was to create [[acoustic music]].<ref name = "Official Biography"/>  The band featured only keyboards, [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]]s, and the classical vocals of Turunen. The three musicians recorded their self-titled acoustic [[Demo (music)|demo]] in the winter of 1996. The name “Nightwish” was derived from the first song the band recorded together, and the first demo also included early versions of “The Forever Moments” and “Etiäinen”. 

After recording the ''Nightwish demo'', Holopainen decided that Turunen’s operatic voice was too powerful for an acoustic band, and decided to add in [[heavy metal]] elements, including electric guitars and drums.<ref name="Official Biography">{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com official biography| work= | url=http://nightwish.com/en/band/biography | accessmonthday=January 27 |accessyear=2008}}</ref> 

===''Angels Fall First'' (1997)===
{{main|Angels Fall First}}

In early 1997, following the release of the ''Nightwish demo'', [[Jukka Nevalainen|Jukka “Julius” Nevalainen]] joined the band, and acoustic guitar was replaced with [[electric guitar]]. The addition of  [[heavy metal]] elements to the band's existing experimental style gave the band a unique sound, forming the core of the Nightwish sound.

The band entered the studio in April 1997 to record seven songs for their second demo, entitled ''Angels Fall First''. As a precursor to their debut full length album of the same name, the demo made its way to the Finnish record label [[Spinefarm Records]] in May 1997. The label signed Nightwish to a two album deal, and the band returned to the studio to re-record songs from their second demo. The full length album ''Angels Fall First'' was released internationally in November 1997 and reached number 31 on the Finnish album charts, with the single “[[The Carpenter]]” reaching number 3 on the Finnish singles chart. “The Carpenter” single was released as a split with label mates [[Children of Bodom]] and [[Thy Serpent]].

''Angels Fall First'' is one of the two albums which features keyboardist [[Tuomas Holopainen]]'s vocals, appearing on four of the album's eleven tracks, alongside vocalist Tarja Turunen. 

Critical reception of ''Angels Fall First'' was mixed, with [[Allmusic]] rating the album 2 out of 5 stars,<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web | title=allmusic | work=Angels Fall First | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:lza9qj1qojfa | accessmonthday=January 1 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and ''The Metal Observer'' stating that Nightwish’s debut album “paled drastically in comparison to their later work".<ref name="metalobsv">{{cite web | title=The Metal Observer | work=Review – Nightwish – Angels Fall First | url=http://www.metal-observer.com/articles.php?lid=1&sid=1&id=2621 | accessmonthday=January 1 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In December 1997, after over a year of existence, Nightwish made their live debut in their hometown [[Kitee]], [[Finland]]. During the winter of 1997 and 1998, the band performed only seven times, due to Nevalainen and Vuorinen’s obligatory Finnish military service, and Turunen finishing her schooling.

===''Oceanborn'' (1998–1999)===

Following a string of live shows in Finland, the band filmed their first video clip for “The Carpenter” in April 1998. Nightwish completed their touring line up in the summer of 1998 when [[Bass guitar|bassist]] [[Sami Vänskä]], an old friend of Holopainen, joined the band. Nightwish then returned to the studio in August 1998 as a five-piece, to record their follow up album for Spinefarm records.

On October 7, 1998, Nightwish released their second full length album, ''Oceanborn'', in Finland only.   Adopting a more technical and progressive sound than ''Angels Fall First'',<ref name="jamesbyrd">{{cite web | title=James Byrd Tribute | work=Nightwish – Oceanborn | url=http://www.geocities.com/byrdtribute/nightwishocean.html | accessmonthday=December 27 |accessyear=2005}}</ref> ''Oceanborn'' saw the band abandon much of the ambient and folk elements present on their debut release. In contrast to the female vocals of Turunen, the album also featured guest growling vocals by [[Tapio Wilska]] (ex-[[Finntroll]]). 

''Oceanborn'' was well received, with Allmusic writing that the album “as a whole works great”, with songs that are “very strong”.<ref name="AllOcean">{{cite web |author=Ravelin, Antti J. |title=''Oceanborn'' review |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:gpfixq8kldte |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessmonthday=January 27 |accessyear=2008}}</ref> ''Oceanborn'' was an instant success in Finland, reaching number 5 on the Finnish album charts. The album’s first single, “[[Sacrament of Wilderness]]”, hit number 1 on the Finnish singles charts, where it stayed for several weeks.<ref name="Official Biography">{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com official biography| work=Nightwish – Oceanborn | url=http://nightwish.com/en/band/biography | accessmonthday=January 27 |accessyear=2008}}</ref> The album’s release was initially limited to Finland, but due to the success of “Sacrement of Wilderness”, Spinefarm released ''Oceanborn'' internationally in the spring of 1999.<ref name="Official Biography"/> 

In May 1999, Nightwish recorded the single “[[Sleeping Sun (Four Ballads of the Eclipse)]]”. In one month the single sold 15,000 copies in Germany alone. Following the band’s first international success, Nightwish was added as the opening band for [[Rage (band)|Rage]]’s 1999 European tour. Both the album ''Oceanborn'' and the single “Sacrament of Wilderness” were certified [[Gold album|gold]] in Finland in August 1999.<ref name="Official Biography"/>

===''Wishmaster'' (2000)===
{{main|Wishmaster (album)}}
While in the studio in early 2000 working on their third album, Nightwish was accepted in the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[2000 Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song “[[Sleepwalker (Nightwish song)|Sleepwalker]]”. ({{audio| Nightwish-sleepwalker.ogg|sample}}) Despite winning the public vote, Nightwish eventually finished in second place, with the jury choosing local gospel singer [[Nina Åström]] to represent Finland.<ref name="Official Biography"/> 

In May 2000, Nightwish released their third studio album ''Wishmaster'' which debuted at #1 on the Finnish album charts, and following three weeks at number one, was certified gold in Finland.<ref name="Official Biography"/> 

Critical response to the album was mixed, with Allmusic citing the album as repetitive, and saying “as a whole album, it can be a little annoying, even frustrating”. However, German magazine ''[[Rock Hard (magazine)|Rock Hard]]'' declared ''Wishmaster'' “Album of the Month”, despite competing against long-awaited May releases from [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Bon Jovi]].

Following the release of ''Wishmaster'', Nightwish embarked on their first world tour, playing dates in South America, Mexico, Canada, and the first headlining European tour with [[Sinergy]] and [[Eternal Tears Of Sorrow]].   In the summer the band returned to Europe, appearing at the  [[Wacken Open Air]] festival and the Biebop Metal Fest.

===''Over the Hills and Far Away EP'' (2001)===
{{main|Over the Hills and Far Away (album)}}

In 2001, Nightwish recorded a cover of [[Gary Moore]]’s “Over the Hills and Far Away” together with two new songs (“10th Man Down” and “Away”) and a remake of “[[Astral Romance]]” (from the ''Angels Fall First'' album). This was released as their first, and so far only, [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Over the Hills and Far Away (album)|Over the Hills and Far Away]]''.

The record included guest performances by [[Tony Kakko]] ([[Sonata Arctica]]) and [[Tapio Wilska]] (ex-[[Finntroll]]). They also released a [[VHS]], [[DVD]] and [[Compact disc|CD]] with live material recorded in a show in [[Tampere]], on [[December 29]], [[2000]]. All of these were entitled ''[[From Wishes to Eternity]]''.

Nightwish’s version of ''Over the Hills and Far Away'' was well received by fans, being a repeating part of the band’s live performances and featuring on several compilation albums as well as the ''[[End of an Era]]'' DVD (in 2006). However, the other new songs never had a great break-through nor has been re-released in any way, as of January 2008.

Shortly after the release, bassist [[Sami Vänskä]] was asked to leave the band, and [[Marco Hietala]] ([[Tarot (band)|Tarot]], [[Sinergy]]) joined the band, effectively leaving Sinergy. Hietala would, apart from playing his instrument, also perform male vocals. Earlier, when needed, either Holopainen (on the ''Angels Fall First'' album) or a guest musician performed the male vocals. Holopainen has afterwards said that he and Vänskä still keep in touch, contrary to rumours saying that they haven't met since. However, they are not interested in making another project together. The reason of Vänskä’s dismissal was that he and Holopainen were too different as musicians, and this was seen as a threat to the band.

===''Century Child'' (2002–2003)===
{{main|Century Child}}

[[Image:NightwishJune2005.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Nightwish on original formation, at [[Ireland]], 2005.]]

In 2002, Nightwish released ''Century Child'', along with the singles “[[Ever Dream]]” and “[[Bless the Child (song)|Bless the Child]]”. The main difference from previous albums is the use of a live [[orchestra]] from Finland on “Bless the Child”, “Ever Dream”, “Feel For You” and “The Beauty of the Beast”, to get a more present feeling of [[European classical music|classical music]]. An enduring favorite of fans, though, is the band’s version of “[[The Phantom of the Opera]]”, from the famous musical of the same name by composer [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]. The song was repeatedly played on concerts until vocalist [[Tarja Turunen]] was replaced with [[Anette Olzon]], whereupon the band announced that they would never play the song live again.

''Century Child'' was certified gold two hours after its release, and platinum two weeks afterwards. It set a record on the Finnish album charts as well; never before had the second been so distant from the first place. After the “[[Bless the Child (song)|Bless the Child]]” video, a second one was recorded, without any single support. The chosen track was “[[End of All Hope]]”. The clip contains pieces from the Finnish movie, ''[[Kohtalon kirja]]'' (English: ''The Book of Fate'').<ref name="kohtalon">{{cite web | title=Kohtalon Kirja | work=Kohtalon Kirja DVD | url=http://www.kohtalonkirja.com/dvd | accessmonthday=December 30 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>

In 2003, Nightwish released their second DVD, entitled ''[[End of Innocence]]''. The DVD tells the story of the band in Holopainen and Nevalainen’s words for two hours. The documentary also features bits of live concerts, exclusive footage, etc.

[[Singer|Vocalist]] [[Tarja Turunen]] also got married during the summer of 2003, and there were rumours that the band was about to be dissolved. These rumours were, at the time, proven to be false, as the band continued on to play concerts for another year and released another album. The marriage later meant a great part in Tarja’s dismissal from the band in the autumn of 2005.

===''Once'' (2004–2005)===

{{main|Once (Nightwish album)}}

[[Image:Nightwish.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Nightwish]] live in 2004, during their “Once World Tour”. Left to right: [[Tuomas Holopainen]] (keyboards), [[Jukka Nevalainen]] (drums), [[Tarja Turunen]] (vocals), [[Marco Hietala]] (bass & vocals), [[Emppu Vuorinen]] (guitars).]]

A new album entitled ''Once'' was released on [[June 7]], [[2004]], along with their first single, “[[Nemo (song)|Nemo]]” (Latin: “Nobody”), from that album. The single topped the charts in Finland and [[Hungary]], and reached the top ten in five additional countries. “Nemo” therefore remains their most successful single release to date.

With ''Once'', Nightwish started to produce [[orchestra|orchestral versions]] of some of their songs. Songs that so far have been produced as orchestral versions include “Nemo”, “[[Ghost Love Score]]”, “[[Eva (song)|Eva]]” and “[[Amaranth (song)|Amaranth]]”.

''Once'' utilizes a full orchestra in nine of the eleven songs on the album. Unlike ''Century Child'', Nightwish decided to look for an orchestra outside of Finland this time, choosing the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]]. It is also their second album to feature a full-length song in Finnish, “[[Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan|Kuolema tekee taiteilijan]]” (English: “Death Makes an Artist”). ''Once'' has sold triple platinum in Finland, platinum in [[Germany]], gold in [[Sweden]] and reached #1 in the [[Greece|Greek]], [[Norway|Norwegian]] and Hungarian album charts. The following singles were: “[[Wish I Had an Angel]]” (featured on the soundtrack of the film ''[[Alone in the Dark (2005 film)|Alone in the Dark]]''), “[[Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan]]” (released only in Finland and [[Japan]]) and “[[The Siren (song)|The Siren]]”. Besides the commercial success, ''Once'' was also accepted by critics, with many positive reviewers drawing comparisons with ''Oceanborn''.

The success of the album allowed them to perform the ''Once World Tour'', which enabled them to play in many countries the band had never visited before. Nightwish performed at the opening ceremony of the [[2005 World Championships in Athletics]], held in [[Helsinki]], highlighting acclaim the band has recently gained.

A “best of” album was released in September 2005, containing songs from their whole discography. The compilation is entitled ''[[Highest Hopes]]'', also featuring a live cover of [[Pink Floyd]]’s song “[[High Hopes (Pink Floyd song)|High Hopes]]” (from the ''[[The Division Bell]]'' album) ([[Media:Nightwish-highhopes.ogg|sample]]). Besides ''High Hopes'', a remake of “[[Sleeping Sun]]” (from ''Oceanborn'') was put on the album, which was also released as a single. A new video for “Sleeping Sun” was shot, featuring a [[medieval]] battle, and can be found on the German release of the single and as a separate DVD released by Spinefarm.

===''End of an Era'' (2005–2006)===
{{main|End of an Era}}

After the recording in the [[Hartwall Areena]] (Helsinki) on [[October 21]], [[2005]], of the new live DVD ''End of an Era'' (released June 2006), the four other members of Nightwish decided that it was best to continue Nightwish without Tarja Turunen,<ref name="wikisource">{{cite web | publisher=Wikisource | title=Open letter to Tarja Turunen | url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Open_Letter_To_Tarja_Turunen | accessmonthday=October 23 |accessyear=2005}}</ref> a feeling they expressed through an [[open letter]] which was given to Turunen by Tuomas Holopainen after the concert, and afterwards posted on the band’s website. It was written by Holopainen but signed by the other band members. The main justification of Turunen’s dismissal given in the letter was that the band felt that both her husband Marcelo Cabuli (an Argentine businessman) and [[Commercialism|commercial]] interests had changed her attitude towards the band. 

Turunen responded to the incident twice, during a press conference in Finland and in Germany, saying that her dismissal came entirely as a shock to her, given that she had not been notified before the letter was given to her. She felt that the personal attacks on her husband were unwarranted, and that playing the issue out to the public was “senselessly cruel”. She expressed these feelings through her own open letter, which was published on her personal website,<ref name="tarjaturunena">{{cite web | publisher=METALYOU.COM | title=Tarja Turunen Letter to the band, fans and media | url=http://www.metalyou.com/band/nightwish/news/nightwish_tarja_turunen_letter_to_the_band_fans_and_media/ | accessmonthday=August 16 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and through various TV, magazine, and newspaper interviews.

===''Dark Passion Play'' (2006–2008)===

{{main|Dark Passion Play}}
[[Image:Nightwish Paris 2008.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Nghtwish in actual formation at [[Paris]], [[2008]].]]
In 2006–2007, the band recorded their sixth full-length studio album, ''Dark Passion Play''. The process began with drum recordings, then guitar, bass and demo keyboards. Orchestral and choir recordings took place in [[Abbey Road Studios]]. After those, the final synthesizers and vocals were recorded.<ref name="NWofficialnews"> {{cite web | title=Nightwish.com | work=News | url=http://nightwish.com/en/news/ | accessmonthday=December 19 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

To find a replacement for Turunen as the female vocalist of the band, on [[March 17]], [[2006]] the band allowed vocalists interested for the position to send in demo tapes as an audition for the spot. During this time, speculation began to emerge as to who would eventually succeed Turunen as the female vocalist for the band. In April 2007, the heavy metal magazine [[Terrorizer]] as an April fools joke reported that [[Sarah Brightman]] would be the new vocalist. In response to this and other rumors, the band stated on their website that fans should not believe any source other than the band itself for information regarding the new vocalist.<ref name="NWofficialnews"/>
Some rumors also said that [[Vibeke Stene]], the former singer of the [[gothic metal]] band [[Tristania (band)|Tristania]], would join the band. 

For the same reason, the identity of the new singer was to be published earlier, and on Thursday 24 May, the 35-year-old [[Alyson Avenue]] lead singer [[Anette Olzon]] from [[Katrineholm]], [[Sweden]] was announced to replace Turunen.<ref name="NWofficialnews"/> The replacement of the lead vocalist has lead to many fans calling the band 'new' Nightwish. Holopainen has said in interviews he did not wish to reveal her identity until new material was available because he did not want fans judging her by nothing more than a picture, or past work.

{{Wikinews|Nightwish release 'Dark Passion Play', most expensive album in Finnish history‎}}

The day after this revealing, charity single “[[Eva (song)|Eva]]” was released as the first off the album, as download only. It was originally scheduled for release on [[May 30]], but due to a leak on a British music download site the single was released on [[May 25]].<ref name="NWofficialnews"/> This was the first published song (excluding short audio samples on the website) to feature Olzon.

On 13 June, Nightwish released the title, ''Dark Passion Play'', and artwork to the new album on their official website, as well as the name and the cover of the second single (this time CD), “[[Amaranth (song)|Amaranth]]”. The single, that first was released in Finland on [[August 22]], included a bonus track entitled “[[While Your Lips Are Still Red]]” written by Tuomas as the main theme track for the upcoming Finnish feature film “Lieksa!”. Technically, it is not a Nightwish-track as it only features [[Marco Hietala]] on vocals and acoustic bass, [[Tuomas Holopainen]] on keys and [[Jukka Nevalainen]] on drums. The song’s video was officially released on [[June 15]].<ref name="NWofficialnews"/> “Amaranth” achieved gold status in Finland after less than two days in stores.<ref name="NWofficialnews"/>

''Dark Passion Play'' was released around Europe in the last week of September, 2007, in the UK on October 1st, and the United States on October 2nd. There were three separate releases: 1) a single-disc standard version and 2) a 2-CD Special Edition which contains 1 bonus track on the 1st disc and a 2nd CD comprised of orchestral versions of every song on the album and 3) a limited edition 3CD version with the two CDs from version two and a third one with some demo versions (of for example “The Poet and the Pendulum”) as well as some bonus tracks (for example “[[Bye Bye Beautiful]]” CD-single’s b-side “The Escapist” and the third single “[[Erämaan Viimeinen]]”, a vocal version of “Last of the Wilds".<ref name="NWofficialnews"/>

In this album, male vocalist [[Marco Hietala]] achieves more freedom in his vocals, singing at least back up in every single song of the album with the exceptions of “Eva” and “Amaranth”, singing lead vocals in several songs, such as “[[The Islander (song)|The Islander]]”, “Master Passion Greed”, “While Your Lips Are Still Red” and “Reach”, (demo version of “Amaranth”), and singing chorus in songs such as “[[Bye Bye Beautiful]]” and “7 Days to the Wolves”.<ref name="NWofficialnews"/>

Several magazines, including ''Kerrang!'' have noted how the departure of Tarja Turunen seems to have released the band from their shell and how restraint has been left to other bands. The use of some 175 additional musicians for the orchestral and solo parts of the album has resulted in the band now being described as “epic metal” by many people – especially in 14 minute album opener “The Poet and The Pendulum”. The album was awarded 5/5 (classic) by ''Kerrang!'' magazine.<ref>Kerrang!</ref>

On [[September 22]], [[2007]], the band hosted a secret concert at Rock Café in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]], disguising itself as a Nightwish [[cover band]] called “Nachtwasser”.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=81338|title=Nightwish performs secret gig in Estonia|date=September 23, 2007|accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref> Their first official concert with the new singer was in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]] on [[October 6]], [[2007]].<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=82280|title=Nightwish performs first official concert with new singer|date=October 7, 2007|accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref> The ''Dark Passion Play'' tour has now visited the [[United States]], [[Canada]], most of [[Europe]], and have (as of December 18, 2007) a planned tour in parts of Asia and [[Australia]], a second tour in North America, Europe and more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nightwish.com/en/band/tour|title=Nightwish – Tour Info|publisher=Nightwish.com|accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=82169|title=Nightwish Australian tour dates announced|date=October 5, 2007|accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref>

The third single of the album was first reported to be “[[Bye Bye Beautiful]]”, and a music video to this song was recorded together with “Amaranth”’s, and released in September, 2007. However, changed minds resulted in the third single being “[[Erämaan Viimeinen]]”, a previously unreleased vocal version of the instrumental song “Last of the Wilds”. It was released in Finland only on [[December 5]], [[2007]]. On this song, Jonsu of the Finnish [[pop music|pop]]/[[rock music|rock]] band [[Indica (Finnish band)|Indica]] performs the Finnish vocals.<ref name="NWofficialnews"/>

On [[December 13]], [[2007]], Nightwish opened an official account on [[YouTube]], linked to from their official website. On this, they've uploaded live filmings from their concerts.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/nightwishofficial YouTube]</ref>

“[[Bye Bye Beautiful]]”, the fourth single, was released on [[February 15]], [[2008]] in two versions; DVD and CD.<ref>[http://www.nwshop.fi/productinfo.cfm?tuotenumero=196964&from=startpage&lang=en Nightwish-Shop]</ref> Within a week after the release, the fifth single was announced to be “[[The Islander (song)|The Islander]]”, to be released on [[May 21]].

According to Holopainen, this will be the longest tour the band has yet attempted, and will probably last about two and a half years.<ref>[http://www.tuomasholopainen.net/int-thnet2.html “TuomasHolopainen.net: Interview"]</ref> As of February, 2008, tour dates for the second leg of the North American tour are booked through May 2008. John Two Hawks performed at the last two shows of this leg. Several summer/fall dates in Europe have been added, largely festivals, including the [[Bloodstock Open Air|Bloodstock Open Air Metal Festival]] in August 2008. They will also be performing at [[Rock am Ring and Rock im Park]] in June 2008 and at [[EXIT (festival)|EXIT festival]] on July 10.<ref>[http://www.metalfromfinland.com/news/2008-02-11_15:02/nightwish_confirmed_for_serbias_exit_festival_ NIGHTWISH Confirmed For Serbia's EXIT Festival]</ref> Nightwish has confirmed that they will do a third US tour in 2008’s second semester, with dates starting at the end of August and carrying on through the autumn.

On March 3, 2008, Nightwish lost by a single vote to the American power metal band [[Kamelot]], in the Metal Storm Awards 2007. Both Nightwish and Kamelot were among the nominees for Best Power Metal Album of 2007 (''Dark Passion Play'', and ''[[Ghost Opera]]'' respectively). They suffered another loss to Kamelot in the category for Best Music Video, their nominated video being for the song “Amaranth”. They, however won Biggest Surprise of 2007.

===''Future album''===
In July, Nightwish's Tuomas said this about a new album:<br>
<br>
Emma's question: "Are you working on a new NW-album at the moment?"

Tuomas' answer: "On an idea-level, yes, all the time. I just bought a new cuddly Snufkin-notebook for the lyrics 'cause the 1st one is already full. At the moment I have one complete song, many song concepts & songtitles and a pretty clear overall vision for the album. It's gonna be fantastic to start working with it full-time, sometime next year. But we need to survive and have a blast on this tour first!"<br>
<br>
The tour will end in spring 2009 and then they will start with the new album.

==Music==
===Influence===
{{main|Tuomas Holopainen}}
Tuomas Holopainen, writer of most of the band’s lyrics and [[Sheet music|musical score]]s, says that he gets most of the inspiration for Nightwish’s songs from [[Film score|film music]].<ref name="tuomasprofile">{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com | work=Profile of Tuomas Holopainen | url=http://www.nightwish.com/en/band/members/facts?id=1 | accessmonthday=December 28 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> Songs like “Beauty of the Beast” (from ''[[Century Child]]''), “Ghost Love Score” (from ''[[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]]'') and “The Poet and the Pendulum” (from ''[[Dark Passion Play]]'') are examples of this influence. Other songs, such as “[[Bye Bye Beautiful]]” (from ''Dark Passion Play''), and “[[Wish I Had an Angel]]” (from ''Once'') have elements of [[industrial metal]], and some others, like “[[The Islander]]” and “Last of the Wilds” (from ''Dark Passion Play''), “[[Creek Mary's Blood]]” (from ''Once''), and the ''[[Angels Fall First]]'' album have elements of [[folk metal]]. Holopainen has also said that film music is the music he listens to for leisure.<ref name="tuomasprofile"/> He likes, for example, the musical scores to ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]]'' and ''[[Crimson Tide]]'', and practically everything written by [[Hans Zimmer]].<ref name="tuomasprofile"/>

Fantasy novels are also a big influence on Nightwish’s music. Many of the lyrics make fairly clear references to fantasy novels, especially the ''Dragonlance'' series and [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Songs such as “Wishmaster”  and “Wanderlust” seem to be heavily influenced by the novels. References to The Kharolis Mountains, 'Shalafi' and Krynn, as well as 'Elbereth' and 'Gray Havens', can be found in these songs. The music of “7 Days to the Wolves” is inspired by [[Stephen King]]’s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' series.

On the other hand, Nightwish has also been noted as a source of inspiration for other bands. [[Simone Simons]], lead singer of [[Epica (band)|Epica]], stated that she began singing due to Nightwish.<ref name="epica">{{cite web | title=Epica Online | work=Profile Simone | url=http://www.epica.nl/index.php?id=45&section=band | accessmonthday=December 28 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> Ex-singer of [[Visions of Atlantis]], [[Nicole Bogner]], also acknowledged that Nightwish had greatly inspired them for their first album.<ref name="musdiscvisions">{{cite web | title=Musical Discoveries | work=Visions of Atlantis (Nicole Bogner) | url=http://www.musicaldiscoveries.com/reviews/voa.htm | accessmonthday=December 30 |accessyear=2005}}</ref> [[Sander Gommans]] of [[After Forever]] said that Nightwish “will certainly influence us in creating new songs”.<ref name="musdiscafter">{{cite web | title=Musical Discoveries | work=After Forever | url=http://www.musicaldiscoveries.com/reviews/aftfor.htm | accessmonthday=December 30 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> [[Power metal]] band [[Sonata Arctica]]’s lead singer [[Tony Kakko]] has explained how much of an influence Nightwish is to him.<ref name="gauntlet">{{cite web | title=The Gauntlet | work=Sonata Arctica Interview | url=http://euro.thegauntlet.com/interviews/1159/Sonata%20Arctica.html | accessmonthday=June 17 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

===Musical style===

Nightwish performs a blend of [[power metal]] and [[symphonic metal]].<ref name="AllCentury">{{cite web |author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |title=''Century Child'' review |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:wxftxqlald6e |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Bowar, Chad |title=''Highest Hopes'' review |url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/cdreviews/fr/nightwish.htm |publisher=[[About.com]] |accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref> Their music has been described as "bombastic, symphonic and cinematic, with keyboards and strings creating a gothic atmosphere."<ref name="AboutDPP">{{cite web |author=Bowar, Chad |title=''Dark Passion Play'' review |url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/cdreviews/fr/nightwishdark.htm |publisher=[[About.com]] |accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref> While the music of Nightwish is "laced with accessible pop sensibilities,"<ref name="AllCentury"/> the band is also known to be complex<ref name="AboutEoAE">{{cite web |author=Bowar, Chad |title=''End of an Era'' review |url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/dvdreviews/fr/nightwishendofa.htm |publisher=[[About.com]] |accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref> and multi-layered.<ref name="AllEnd"/> Their approach is epic,<ref>{{cite web |author=Bowar, Chad |title=''Highest Hopes'' review |url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/cdreviews/fr/nightwish.htm |publisher=[[About.com]] |accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref> theatrical and operatic.<ref name="AllEnd">{{cite web |author=Fulton, Katherine |title=''End of an Era'' review |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:axfixqqdldde~T1 |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref> Critic Chad Bowar notes that the music is "always very melodic with memorable choruses and a lot of hooks."<ref name="AboutDPP"/>
