'''William Arras Johnston''' ([[26 February]], [[1922]]&ndash;[[24 May]], [[2007]]) was an [[Australia national cricket team|Australian]] [[cricket]]er who played in forty [[Test cricket|Test matches]] from 1947 to 1955. A left arm [[pace bowling|pace bowler]], as well as a [[left arm orthodox]] [[spin bowling|spinner]], Johnston was best known as a spearhead of [[Donald Bradman|Don Bradman's]] undefeated 1948 touring team, well known as "[[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|The Invincibles]]". Johnston headed the wicket-taking lists in both Test and [[first-class cricket|first-class]] matches on the tour, and was the last Australian to take over 100 wickets on a tour of England. In recognition of his performances, he was named by ''[[Wisden]]'' as one of its [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year|Cricketers of the Year]] in 1949. The publication stated that "no Australian made a greater personal contribution to the playing success of the 1948 side". Regarded by Bradman as Australia's greatest-ever left-arm bowler, Johnston was noted for his endurance in bowling pace with the new ball and spin when the ball had worn. He became the fastest bowler to reach 100 Test wickets in 1951&ndash;52, at the time averaging less than nineteen with the ball. By the end of the season, he had played 24 Tests and contributed 111 wickets. Australia won nineteen and lost only two of these Tests. In 1953, a knee injury forced him to remodel his bowling action, and he became less effective before retiring after aggravating the injury in 1955. In retirement, he worked in sales and marketing, and later ran his own businesses. He had two sons, one of whom became a cricket administrator. Johnston died at the age of 85 in May 2007.

== Early years ==
Johnston took up cricket from an early age, playing with his elder brother Allan throughout the year on a backyard pitch on the family’s dairy farm, owned by his father. [[Beeac, Victoria|Beeac]]’s local team, which competed in the Colac District Association, occasionally had difficulty in assembling a full side. As a result, Johnston made his debut aged only twelve alongside his brother after an invitation from his schoolteacher. On debut, when a draw became a foregone conclusion, Johnston was allowed to bowl the final over, taking a wicket maiden. The following season, the brothers led Beeac's attack, continuing to do so after moving to Colac High School, where Bill became captain of the cricket and football teams and head prefect. Johnston left school at sixteen, working in Colac, before following Allan to [[Melbourne]] in 1939. He joined [[Richmond Cricket Club]] in the Third XI and took 6/16. After five games he was promoted to the Second XI, and made his first grade debut in the last game of the 1939&ndash;40 season. The following season, when nineteen, he was selected for [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]]'s [[Sheffield Shield]] match against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]], but the [[Pearl Harbor attacks]] forced the cancellation of competitive cricket.<ref name="wisden"/><ref name="az"/> Johnston joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] along with his brother, serving for four years as a radar technician in northern Australia. It was at training camp that he first met [[Keith Miller]].<ref name="guard"/> Johnston was not posted overseas, unlike his brother, who died after crashing in [[Ireland]].<ref name="wisden">{{cite web| title= Wisden 1949 - William Johnston |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154626.html| year= 1949 |accessdate=2007-05-25| publisher=[[Wisden]]}}</ref><ref name="az">{{cite book | last = Cashman, Franks, Maxwell, Sainsbury, Stoddart, Weaver, Webster | year = 1997 | title = The A-Z of Australian cricketers|isbn=0-19-550604-9|publisher= Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne}}</ref>

==First class and Test debut ==

Prior to the [[Second World War]], Johnston was a slow-medium and left arm orthodox bowler, but during a practice session, he bowled a quicker ball to [[Jack Ryder]] a former Australian captain, Victorian selector and Test batsman. This prompted Ryder to wage a personal campaign to induce Johnston to become a pace bowler. Upon the resumption of first-class cricket in 1945&ndash;46, Johnston made his Shield debut and entrusted with the responsibility of opening the attack. He felt that the fast bowling was only for short periods with the new ball, and that he would be allowed to revert to spin bowling as the ball became older.<ref name="wisden"/><ref name="az"/>

As opportunities for slow bowling became infrequent, he contemplated retirement. Although he dismissed [[Cyril Washbrook]] in the first over of Victoria's match against [[Wally Hammond]]'s touring [[England national cricket team|England team]] of 1946&ndash;47, he was skeptical about his pace bowling. It took further encouragement from Australian captain Don Bradman after he played against Bradman's [[Southern Redbacks|South Australian]]s. Bradman told Johnston that the selectors thought highly of his potential as a medium-fast bowler to reinforce the short bursts of pace spearheads [[Ray Lindwall]] and Keith Miller and that pace bowlers were in short supply.<ref name="haigh"/> Johnston practised his pace bowling with new vigour, and at the start of the 1947&ndash;48 season, took an opening burst of 3/0 for Victoria against the touring [[India national cricket team|Indian team]]. He was rewarded with selection for four of the five Tests against India, making his debut on a sticky wicket in the First Test in [[Brisbane]],<ref name="indep">{{cite news|title=Obituaries:Bill Johnston| url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2584120.ece| publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=[[2007-05-25]] |accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref> taking 2/17 as India fell for 58 in the first innings and 1/11 in the second as India fell for 98 following on, resulting in an innings defeat.<ref name="vic"/> He took match figures of 5/48 in the Second Test in another innings victory.<ref name="testlist"/> The Third Test was Johnston's first Test in front of his home crowd of the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]].<ref name="testlist"/> In the first innings, he removed both of India's openers as Australia took a 103-run first innings lead.

During the Ashes tour, Johnston roomed with [[Doug Ring]] who was a team-mate in the [[Richmond Cricket Club|Richmond]] and Victorian cricket teams. As Ring was a [[leg spin|leg-spin]] bowler, he and Johnston were in direct competition for a place in the eleven. Australia had traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]]. When Johnston was omitted in favour of Ring, it appeared he would not be in Bradman's Test plans. Bradman changed his mind on the morning of the First Test in [[Trent Bridge]] when rain was forecast. Johnston was played in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket.<ref name="haigh">{{cite news| title=Gentrifying the game| first=Gideon | last=Haigh| authorlink=Gideon Haigh| url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/295893.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |date=[[2007-05-26]]| accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref> He showed his credentials by bowling a total of 84 overs to help Australia to grind out a victory.<ref name="cobit">{{cite news| title= 'Invincible' bowler Johnston dies at 85 |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/295739.html |date=[[2007-05-25]]| accessdate=2007-06-01| publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref> England batted first and with strike bowler [[Ray Lindwall]] breaking down on the first day, Johnston removed [[Bill Edrich]] and [[Joe Hardstaff junior]] in one over to leave England at 4/46.

Australia went on to break the world record Test run-chases record to take a 3&ndash;0 lead. Johnston rounded off the series with match figures of 6/60 in the Fifth Test at [[The Oval]] from 43.3 overs. Johnston took the least three wickets in the match as Australia completed a 4&ndash;0 series result with an innings victory.<ref name="haigh"/><ref name="testlist"/> In all, Johnston finished with 27 Test wickets at an average of 23.33,<ref name="p251">Perry, p. 251.</ref> equal to Lindwall.<ref name="wisden"/>

In both the Test and county matches during the 1948 tour, Johnston carried the heaviest workload, bowling nearly 200 overs more than any other member of the squad. He was the leading wicket-taker with 102 wickets at 16.42,<ref name="p256">Perry, p. 256.</ref> and the last Australian to take a century of wickets on an Ashes tour.<ref name="guard"/> His best performances in the tour games included a match haul of 10/40 against [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] at [[Bradford]], bowling finger spin on a wet pitch, 8/68 against [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] and 11/117 against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]]. After carrying a heavy workload in the early stages of the tour, he was used more sparingly in the latter stages. As the tour progressed Johnston improved his control as he restrained England's batsmen between the new ball bursts of Lindwall and Miller. Johnston finished the season at the top of the first-class bowling averages and was chosen as one of ''[[Wisden Cricketer's Almanack|Wisden's]]'' [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year|Five Cricketers of the Year]]. ''Wisden'' opined that "no Australian made a greater personal contribution to the playing success of the 1948 side".<ref name="wisden"/><ref name="az"/> [[Jack Fingleton]] wrote that Australia had never sent a greater left-hander to England.<ref name="indep"/>

== Later career ==
Johnston's next assignment was the 1949&ndash;50 tour to [[South Africa]]. The tour started badly when he fell asleep at the wheel in [[Durban]] following a team function and crashed his car. The team manager was informed that Johnston was in danger of dying of head injuries, with Johnston later describing his injury as a "nine-iron divot in the top of my skull".<ref name="guard"/><ref name="vic"/> [[Keith Miller]] was called to South Africa as emergency cover,<ref>Perry, pp. 266&ndash;267.</ref> but Johnston recovered in time for the Tests and both played. Johnston took 2/21 in the first innings of the First Test against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] at [[Johannesburg]] and the hosts were forced to [[follow on]]. He took 6/44 including the last three wickets in the second innings, his career best innings figures in Test cricket, helping Australia take an innings victory and a 1&ndash;0 series lead.<ref name="testlist"/><ref name="rsa1">{{cite web| title = 1st Test South Africa v Australia at at Ellis Park, Johannesburg Dec 24&ndash;28 1949|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62704.html|publisher= [[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref> After taking three wickets in the Second Test victory at [[Cape Town]], he was more prominent in the Third at Durban with match figures of 8/114 as Australia took the series 3&ndash;0.<ref name="testlist"/> South Africa had reached 2/242 in their first innings when Johnston removed their captain [[Dudley Nourse]], precipitating a loss of 8/69 as the hosts were bowled out for 311.

Johnston then removed [[John Nel]] and [[Billy Wade]] without further addition to the score, sparking a collapse of 8/14 which saw the home team all out for 99.

In addition, he scored 28 in the Second Test. Johnston's best match performance came in the only loss in the Third Test at [[Adelaide]].<ref name="testlist"/> This happened when captain [[Lindsay Hassett]] was a late withdrawal due to injury, leaving Australia with an unbalanced team with only four specialist batsmen who could not consolidate the work done by the five specialist bowlers.<ref>Benaud, p. 55.</ref> It was in this match that Johnston passed 100 Test wickets, the fastest player to do so.<ref name="smh"/> Exploiting a wet patch at the striker's end,<ref>Perry, p. 309.</ref> Johnston took 6/62 in the first innings but was unable to stop an Australian defeat.<ref name="testlist"/>

He was to surpass this in the following season with 8/52 against Queensland, which remained his best first-class innings analysis.<ref name="vic"/>

== Decline ==

Johnston could not maintain his form in the 1952&ndash;53 home series against South Africa. He took match figures of 3/83, 2/114 and 2/97 as the first three Tests were won, lost and won, respectively.<ref name="testlist"/> In the Fourth Test at Adelaide, both Lindwall and Miller broke down in the middle of match.<ref name="p320">Perry, p. 320.</ref> leaving Australia two bowlers short. In their absence, Johnston took 5/110 and 2/67 but Australia were unable to force a win.<ref name="testlist"/> Lindwall and Miller were unable to play, and in their absence, the South Africans were able to score heavily. Johnston had a large workload, taking 6/152 and 1/114 as the tourists won to level the series 2&ndash;2.<ref name="p320"/><ref name="testlist"/> In the last two Tests, Johnston conceded more than 100 runs in three of the four innings with the increased burden in his colleagues' absence; the only previous occasion when he had conceded a century of runs in an innings was in the First Test against England in 1948 when Lindwall broke down mid-match.<ref name="testlist"/><ref name="report1"/> Johnston was again Australia's leading wicket-taker with 21 wickets,{{Fact|date=July 2008}} but his average of 35.10 was substantially higher than in previous seasons,<ref name="testlist"/> as Australia struggled to a 2&ndash;2 series result. It was the first time Australia had not won a Test series since the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1938|1938 Ashes tour]].<ref name="auslist"/> 

After injuring his knee in a festival match at the beginning of the tour at [[East Molesey Cricket Club|East Molesey]],<ref name="p326"/> Johnston missed the first six first-class matches, before recovering to play in the First Test at Trent Bridge. He was economical but unpenetrative, conceding 36 runs in 36 overs without taking a wicket. He took match figures of 4/161 in the Second Test before a recurrence of the knee injury intervened again. A haul of 6/63 against [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]]<ref>Benaud, p. 79.</ref> saw his return for the Fifth Test at The Oval. A total of 74 overs in the match yielded 3/146, and Johnston was unable to prevent the victory that saw England reclaim the Ashes 1&ndash;0. He managed only seven Test wickets at 49.00,<ref name="testlist"/> but in first-class matches took 75 wickets at 20.54.<ref name="vic">{{cite web|title=Johnston, William Arras| url=http://premier.cricketvictoria.com.au/page/johnston_william_arras.html |publisher=[[Victorian Premier Cricket]] |accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref><ref name="testlist"/> His injuries were considered a major factor in Australia's loss of the series.<ref name="guard"/><ref name="p326">Perry, p. 326.</ref> 

The 1954&ndash;55 series against England was to be Johnston's last Test success. He took 19 wickets at 22.26 in the first four Tests before missing the last as England took the series 3&ndash;1.<ref name="testlist"/> He took 3/106 as Australia won the First Test by an innings.<ref name="testlist"/>

In the Second Test at [[Sydney]], Johnston took 3/56 and 3/70 in a low-scoring match. He had another notable innings when he joined [[Neil Harvey]] with 78 runs needed for victory on a difficult batting surface against the hostile pace of [[Frank Tyson]] and [[Brian Statham]]. They put together a stubborn 39 run tenth-wicket partnership which gave Australia hope of an unlikely victory before Johnston was caught behind for 11.<ref name="times"/><ref name="testlist"/> After taking 1/26 in the first innings, Johnston took 5/85 in the second innings of his last Test performance in front of his home crowd at the MCG.<ref name="testlist"/> This left Australia 240 to win but there was to be no fairytale as England won by 128 runs.<ref>Perry, pp. 356&ndash;357.</ref> Johnston then took match figures of 4/80 in the Fourth Test at Adelaide, in what was to be the his last Test on Australian soil.<ref name="testlist"/>

His career ended unhappily on Australia's first tour to the West Indies.<ref name="testlist"/> He took match figures of 2/126 in the First Test in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], Jamaica in a high-scoring win.<ref name="testlist"/><ref>Perry, pp. 364&ndash;367.</ref> These were to be his last Test wickets as he took a total of 0/60 in the Second Test in [[Trinidad]]. He was retained for the Third Test but injured himself while fielding and neither batted nor bowled.<ref name="testlist"/> He was rested for the Fourth but returned for the Fifth. On the first day he suffered a knee injury as he changed direction while attempting to catch a [[Clyde Walcott]] pull shot.<ref name="vic"/> He was carried from the ground and his Test career ended without bowling or batting in either of his last two matches.<ref name="testlist"/>

Johnston retired from first-class cricket after the tour, but played grade cricket for Richmond until the end of 1958&ndash;59, taking 452 wickets at 16.61 in his grade career.<ref name="vic"/>

Standing 188&nbsp;cm, Johnston had a smooth ten-pace approach to the wicket, with an idiosyncratic dip of his head before the instant of delivery. He had success on moist English pitches, with deliveries from over the wicket because of the increased chances of [[leg before wicket]] decisions and to induce edges from balls angling across the batsmen. His stock ball swung into the right-hander, but he mixed this with an away swinger. The late swing in flight which generated the batsman's uncertainty over the direction in which the ball would move was responsible for the majority of Johnston’s wickets in England. Although his pace was lower than that generated by Lindwall or Miller, he was noted for his accuracy and ability to revert to spin bowling on sticky wickets. He possessed strong hands, attributed to his milking of the family’s cattle herd. Johnston was an economical bowler, conceding only 2.07 runs per over.<ref name="haigh"/> He was known for his elbow movement and flailing arms during his delivery action, with one commentator noting "one of these days an umpire will get a poke in the eye". Johnston also had a reputation of visibly enjoying himself on field, putting his hand on his hips and grinning, regardless of the result of his delivery.<ref name="smh"/> His feet position were peculiar in that his front foot was parallel to the crease and his back foot perpendicular, the opposite of the conventional posture. This inhibited his follow through and put more stress on his ankles and shins.<ref name="haigh"/> As a result, his right ankle had to be bound tightly in order to prevent jarring from his awkward delivery.<ref name="wisden"/> After the knee injury, he altered his action into a more conventional one so that his front foot pointed towards the batsman. This eased the pressure on his body, but his ability to move the ball diminished.<ref name="haigh"/> Johnston was a keen student of the game, and although he did not see a state match until his debut, and watched only one Test before his debut, he supplemented his knowledge by reading cricket books. During his early first-class career, upon returning from matches, he would read articles by Bradman, [[Bert Oldfield]] and [[Arthur Mailey]] from a book given to him by his schoolteacher when he was a schoolboy.<ref name="wisden"/><ref name="az"/>
 
Bradman rated him as "Australia’s greatest left-hand bowler".<ref name="az"/> As a result of his ability to bowl spin and pace, teammate Neil Harvey noted that the team effectively had 13 players:"we reckoned Bradman was worth two and Bill Johnston was worth two".<ref name="tribute"/> Harvey felt that Johnston was the best team man, and [[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown]] noted Johnston's work ethic in bowling for long periods after Lindwall and Miller were given the best opportunities with the new ball.<ref name="tribute">{{cite news|title=Invincibles pay tribute to Johnston| url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/295751.html |date=[[2007-05-25]]| accessdate=2007-06-01| publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref> [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] described him as "the finest team man and tourist" in cricket and valued his personality,<ref name="wisden"/><ref name="az"/> while Miller described him as "the most popular man in cricket".<ref name="haigh"/> He sometimes amused others by demonstrating his double jointedness, wrapping his feet around the back of his neck. He is reputed to have nearly drowned when he attempted this in the bath at Lord’s.<ref name="smh"/>

Johnston had a reputation as a poor batsman, averaging less than 13 in Tests and first-class matches without making a half century. He headed the averages in England in 1953, being not out 16 times out of 17 and averaging 102.00. He attributed this to "a lot of application, concentration and dedication",<ref name="az"/> stating that "class always tells".<ref name="az"/> When Hassett realised that Johnston was atop the batting averages, he told Johnston to tell the opposing captain of this fact and ask them to refrain from dismissing him.<ref name="haigh"/> In the last match against T. N. Pearce’s XI at [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], English Test paceman [[Alec Bedser]] bowled wide of the stumps and advised Johnston not to do anything that would lose him his wicket.<ref name="times">{{cite news| title=Bill Johnston|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article1842406.ece |publisher=[[The Times]] | date=[[2007-05-26]] |accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref>

==Life after cricket==

Johnston had a varied career after cricket, holding a variety of jobs. These included acting as a sales representative for sports goods and shoe companies, a publican and an apartment building manager. In his later working career, he ran a post office on the [[Gold Coast]] of [[Queensland]] after he and his wife moved there.<ref name="smh"/>

He married Judy and they had two sons David and Peter. When he married Judy at St. Paul’s [[Church of England|Anglican]] Cathedral in Melbourne, Catholic guests, including captain Lindsay Hassett were not permitted entry.<ref name="haigh"/> [[David Johnston (cricketer)|David Johnston]] played 10 matches for South Australia as first-class level,<ref name="az"/> and later became an administrator and was the Chief Executive of the [[Tasmanian Cricket Association]] at the time of his father's death.<ref name="smh">{{cite news

Outside cricket, Johnston also played [[baseball]]. He won the world's junior championship for throwing a distance of {{convert|125|yd|m}}, and he broke the national baseball long distance record with a {{convert|132|yd|m|sing=on}} throw in September 1945.<ref name="wisden"/>

After the death of his wife in 2004, Johnston moved from the Gold Coast to a Sydney nursing home to be close to his son Peter. He died peacefully in a Sydney nursing home on May 25, 2007.<ref name="guard">{{cite news| title=Obituary:Bill Johnston| first= David |last=Frith |authorlink=David Frith| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/australia/story/0,,2089626,00.html|date=[[2007-05-28]] |accessdate=2007-05-31| publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>
