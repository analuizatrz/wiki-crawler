The [[Abenaki]] (also Wabanaki) are a [[Indigenous peoples in the United States|Native American]] tribe located in the northeastern [[United States]].  Religious ceremonies are led by [[shaman]]s, called [[Medeoulin]] (Mdawinno).

The history of the Abenaki people is divided into three time periods.  In the first, the Ancient Age, humanity and animal-life are undifferentiated.  In the second, the Golden Age, humans are still animals, but quantitatively different.  In the third, the Present Age, animals and humanity are totally differentiated.

=== Gluskab and Malsumis ===

[[Tabaldak]], the creator god, made humans and then [[Glooscap|Gluskab]] (several variants of whom were associated with different branches of the Abenaki, including [[Glooscap]], Glooskap, Gluskabe Klooskomba) and [[Malsumis]] sprang from the dust on his hand.  Gluskab and Malsumis both had the power to create a good world, but only Gluskab did so.  Malsumis still seeks evil to this day.

Gluskab founded the Golden Age of the Earth by rendering the evil spirits of the Ancient Age smaller and safer, as well as teaching humanity how to hunt and fish, build shelter and all of the Abenaki's knowledge of art, invention and science.  Gluskab's departure ended the Golden Age, though he is prophesied to return and renew it again.

[[Me-koom-wee-soo]] was Gluskab's assistant and wields an ivory bow.  He has a fierce temper and gains weight as he gets more angry; eventually, it is said, he sinks into stone.  Gluskab and Me-koom-wee-soo had an archery contest once; Me-koom-wee-soo fired an arrow into the top of [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mt. Washington]], creating a pond, while Gluskab's arrow created a hole in the sky that was then called msatawa (the Evening Star).

Gluskab realized the strain hunters can cause on an [[ecosystem]].  He asked a [[woodchuck]] spirit for help, and she gave him all the hairs off her belly, woven into a magical sac.  This is why woodchucks have bald bellies.  Gluskab then went to a mountain, where Tabaldak had placed a huge [[eagle]] ([[Bmola|P-mol-a]]) that made bad weather by flapping its wings.  After binding it, Gluskab realized some wind was necessary and loosened them slightly.  Gluskab saved the world from a [[frog]] monster that swallowed all the planet's water.  When Gluskab cut open the monster's belly, some animals jumped into the water and became [[fish]].  Some modern Wabanaki believe that Gluskab is angry at white people for not obeying his rules.
