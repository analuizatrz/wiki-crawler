==History==
{{main|History of Brazil}}

===Origins===
{{main|Indigenous peoples in Brazil}}

[[Image:Debret37.jpg|left|thumb|[[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Brazilian natives]], by [[Jean-Baptiste Debret]].]]

Within Brazil's current borders, most native [[tribe]]s who were living in the land by the year 1500 are thought to have descended from the first wave of migrants from North Asia ([[Siberia]]), who are believed to have crossed the [[Bering Land Bridge]] at the end of the last [[Ice Age]], around 9000&nbsp;BC. By the time Europeans arrived, the territory of modern Brazil had as many as 2,000&nbsp;nations and tribes, an estimated total population of nearly 3 million [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]]. A somewhat dated linguistic survey found 188&nbsp;living [[Languages of Brazil|indigenous languages]] with 155,000&nbsp;total speakers. On [[18 January]] [[2007]], [[Fundação Nacional do Índio]] ([[English language|English]]: National Indian Foundation) reported that it had confirmed the presence of 67&nbsp;different uncontacted tribes in Brazil, up from 40 in 2005. With this addition, Brazil is now confirmed as having the largest number of [[uncontacted peoples]] in the world, even more than the island of [[New Guinea]]. When the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] arrived in 1500, the Amerindians were mostly semi-[[nomadic]] tribes, living mainly on the coast and along the banks of major rivers.

Unlike [[Christopher Columbus]] who thought he had reached the [[East Indies]], the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], best known for [[Vasco da Gama]], had already reached [[India]] via the Indian Ocean route when they reached Brazil. Nevertheless, the word ''índios'' ("Indians") was by then established to designate the peoples of the [[New World]] and stuck being used today in the Portuguese language, while the people of India are called ''indianos'' in order to distinguish the two peoples. Initially, the Europeans saw the natives as [[noble savage]]s, and [[miscegenation]] of the population began right away. Tribal warfare, [[cannibalism]], and the pursuit of [[brazilwood]] for its treasured red dye convinced the Portuguese that they should "[[enculturation|civilize]]" the Amerindians.<ref>Megan Mylan, [http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/brazil501/indians_trade.html Indians of the Amazon], Jewel of the Amazon, FRONTLINE/World, [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), ([[24 January]] [[2006]])</ref>

===Colonization===
{{main|Colonial Brazil}}
[[Image:Brazil-16-map.jpg|left|thumb|Map of Brazil issued by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[explorer]]s in 1519.]]

Initially Portugal had little interest in Brazil, mainly because of high profits gained through commerce with [[Indochina]]. After 1530, the [[List of Portuguese monarchs|Portuguese Crown]] devised the [[Hereditary Captaincies]] system to effectively occupy its new colony, and later took direct control of the failed captaincies.<ref>Fundação Maria e Oscar Americano website, [http://www.fundacaooscaramericano.org.br/eng/Collection/Colonial_Brazil/colonial_brazil.html "Colonial Brazil"], retrieved [[12 June]] [[2007]].</ref><ref>CasaHistória website, [http://www.casahistoria.net/Brazil.htm#Colonial_Brazil "Colonial Brazil"], retrieved [[12 June]] [[2007]].</ref> Although temporary trading posts were established earlier to collect [[brazilwood]], used as a dye, with permanent settlement came the establishment of the [[sugarcane]] industry and its intensive labor. Several early settlements were founded across the coast, among them the colonial capital, [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador]], established in 1549 at the [[Bay of All Saints]] in the north, and the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]] on March 1567, in the south. The Portuguese colonists adopted an economy based on the production of agricultural goods that were exported to Europe. Sugar became by far the most important Brazilian colonial product until the early 18th century.<ref>[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0013-0117(1963)2%3A16%3A2%3C219%3AAT1%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Q JSTOR: Anglo-Portuguese Trade, 1700-1770]. [[JSTOR]]. Retrieved on [[August 16]], [[2007]].</ref><ref>Janick, Jules. [http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/history/lecture34/lec34.html Lecture 34]. Retrieved on [[August 16]], [[2007]]</ref> Even though Brazilian sugar was reputed as being of high quality, the industry faced a crisis during the 17th and 18th centuries when the Dutch and the French started producing sugar in the [[Antilles]], located much closer to Europe, causing sugar prices to fall.

During the 18th century, private explorers who called themselves the [[Bandeirantes]] found gold and diamond deposits in the state of Minas Gerais. The exploration of these mines were mostly used to finance the Portuguese Royal Court's expenditure with both the preservation of its [[Global Empire]] and the support of its luxurious lifestyle at mainland. The way in which such deposits were exploited by the Portuguese Crown and the powerful local elites, however, burdened colonial Brazil with excessive taxes. Some popular movements supporting independence came about against the taxes established by the colonial government, such as the [[Tiradentes]]  in 1789, but the secessionist movements were often dismissed by the authorities of the ruling colonial regime. Gold production declined towards the end of the 18th century, starting a period of relative stagnation of the Brazilian hinterland.<ref>Maxwell, Kenneth R. ''Conflicts and Conspiracies: Brazil and Portugal 1750-1808''. Cambridge University Press: 1973.</ref> Both [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian]] and [[Afro-Brazilian|African]] [[slave]]s' man power were largely used in Brazil's colonial economy.<ref>[http://www.labhstc.ufsc.br/pdf2007/16.16.pdf Slavery in Brazil] retrieved on [[August 19]], [[2007]].</ref>

In contrast to the neighboring Spanish possessions in South America, the Portuguese colony of Brazil kept its territorial, political and linguistic integrity due to the action of the Portuguese administrative effort. Although the colony was threatened by other nations across the era of Portuguese rule, in particular by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[France|French]] powers, the authorities and the people ultimately managed to protect its [[Borders of Brazil|borders]] from foreign attacks. Portugal even had to send bullion to Brazil, a spectacular reversal of the colonial trend, in order to protect the integrity of the colony.<ref>Kenneth R. Maxwell, [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-1615(197410)31%3A2%3C221%3ACACBAP%3E2.0.CO%3B2-L Conflicts and Conspiracies: Brazil and Portugal 1750-1808 (p. 216)], [[JSTOR]]</ref>

===Empire===
{{main|Empire of Brazil}}
[[Image:Fala do trono.jpg|right|thumb|[[Imperial Family of Brazil|Emperor]] [[Pedro II of Brazil|Dom Pedro II of Brazil]] in 1873.]]

In 1808, the Portuguese court, fleeing from [[Napoleon]]’s troops who had invaded Portugal, established themselves in the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]], which thus became the seat of government of Portugal and the entire [[Portuguese Empire]], even though being located outside of Europe. Rio de Janeiro was the capital of the Portuguese empire from 1808 to 1815. After that, the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] (1815-1825) was created with [[Lisbon]] as its capital. After João VI returned to Portugal in 1821, his heir-apparent [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] became regent of the Kingdom of Brazil, within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Following a series of [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|political incidents and disputes]], Brazil achieved its independence from Portugal on [[September 7]], [[1822]]. On [[October 12]], [[1822]], Dom Pedro became the first Emperor of Brazil, being crowned on [[December 1]], [[1822]]. Portugal would recognize Brazil as an independent country in 1825.

In 1824, Pedro closed the Constituent Assembly, stating that the body was "endangering liberty". Pedro then produced a constitution modeled on that of Portugal (1822) and France (1814). It specified indirect elections and created the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government; however, it also added a fourth branch, the "moderating power", to be held by the Emperor. Pedro's government was considered economically and administratively inefficient. Political pressures eventually made the Emperor step down on [[April 7]], [[1831]]. He returned to Portugal leaving behind his five-year-old son [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]]. Until Pedro II reached maturity, Brazil was governed by regents from 1831 to 1840. The regency period was turbulent and marked by numerous local revolts including the [[Male Revolt]], the largest urban [[slave rebellion]] in the Americas, which took place in Bahia in 1835.<ref>Reis, João José. ''Slave Rebellion in Brazil - The Muslim Uprising of 1835 in Bahia''. Translated by Arthur Brakel. Johns Hopkins University Press.</ref>

On [[July 23]], [[1840]], Pedro II was crowned Emperor. His government was marked by a substantial rise in coffee exports, the [[War of the Triple Alliance]], and the end of [[slave trade]] from Africa in 1850, although [[slavery]] in Brazilian territory would only be abolished in 1888. By the Eusébio de Queirós law,<ref>Leslie Bethell, [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-1953(197122)2%3A1%3C198%3ATAOTBS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-5 The Abolition of the Brazilian Slave Trade: Britain, Brazil, and the Slave Trade Question, 1807-1969], [[JSTOR]]</ref>Brazil stopped [[Atlantic slave trade|trading slaves from Africa]] in 1850.

By 1889 Pedro II had stepped down and the Republican system had been adopted in Brazil.  In the end, the empire really fell because of a [[coup d'etat]].

The Brazilian Federation is based on the union of three autonomous political entities: the States, the Municipalities and the Federal District.<ref name="Constituição"/> A fourth entity originated in the aforementioned association: the Union.<ref name="Constituição"/> There is no hierarchy among the political entities. The Federation is set on six fundamental principles:<ref name="Constituição"/> [[sovereignty]], [[citizenship]], [[dignity]] of the people, social value of [[labor]], freedom of [[Organization|enterprise]], and [[political pluralism]]. The classic tripartite branches of government ([[Executive (government)|executive]], [[Legislature|legislative]], and [[Judiciary|judicial]] under the [[checks and balances]] system), is formally established by the Constitution.<ref name="Constituição"/> The executive and legislative are organized independently in all four political entities, while the judiciary is organized only in the federal and state levels.

Brazilian law is based on [[Roman law|Roman]]-[[Germania|Germanic]] traditions.<ref>[http://www.oas.org/juridico/mla/en/bra/en_bra-int-des-ordrjur.html "The Brazilian Legal System"], Organization of American States. Accessed [[May 17]], [[2007]].</ref> Thus, [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] concepts prevail over common law practices. Most of Brazilian law is [[codified]], although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part of the system, playing a complementary role. Court decisions set out interpretive guidelines; however, they are not binding on other specific cases except in a few situations. Doctrinal works and the works of academic jurists have strong influence in law creation and in law cases. The legal system is based on the Federal Constitution, which was promulgated on [[October 5]], [[1988]], and is the fundamental law of Brazil. All other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules.<ref>Silva, José Afonso da; ''Curso de Direito Constitucional Positivo''; Malheiros, 2004, p. 46, ISBN 85-7420-559-1</ref> As of April 2007, there have been 53 amendments.

[[Jurisdiction]] is administered by the judiciary entities, although in rare situations the Federal Constitution allows the Federal Senate to pass on legal judgments.<ref name="Constituição"/> There are also specialized military, labor, and electoral courts.<ref name="Constituição"/> The highest court is the [[Supreme Federal Tribunal]]. This system has been criticised over the last decades due to the slow pace at which final decisions are issued.

==Subdivisions==
{{main|Subdivisions of Brazil}}

|{{Brazil Labelled Map|float=left}}

Politically, Brazil is a [[federation]] of 26&nbsp;[[States of Brazil|states]] ({{lang|pt|''estados''}}) and one [[Brazilian Federal District|federal district]] ({{lang|pt|''Distrito Federal''}}) which contains the [[capital city]], [[Brasília]].<ref name="Constituição"/> The states are subdivided into [[List of cities in Brazil|municipalities]]. States are based on historical, conventional borders and have developed throughout the centuries; though some boundaries are arbitrary. The federal district is not a state on its right, but shares some characteristics of a state and some of a [[municipality]]. The national territory was divided in 1969 by the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] (IBGE), for demographic and statistical purposes, into five main regions: [[North Region, Brazil|North]], [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]], [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West]], [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]] and [[Southern Region, Brazil|South]].

In 1943, with the entrance of Brazil into the [[Second World War]], the [[Getulio Vargas|Vargas regime]] detached seven strategic territories from the border of the country in order to administrate them directly: Amapá, [[Roraima|Rio Branco]], [[Acre]], [[Rondônia|Guaporé]], [[Ponta Porã]], [[Iguaçu]] and the [[archipelago]] of [[Fernando de Noronha]]. After the war, the first three territories were retained as states, with Rio Branco and Guaporé being renamed [[Roraima]] and [[Rondônia]], respectively. Ponta Porã and Iguaçu resorted to territorial status. In 1988, Fernando de Noronha became part of [[Pernambuco]].

In 1960, the square-shaped ''Distrito Federal'' was carved out of [[Goiás]] in preparation for the new capital, [[Brasília]]. The previous federal district became the state of [[Guanabara]] until in 1975 it was merged with the state of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], becoming the [[Rio de Janeiro|municipality of Rio de Janeiro]].

In 1977, [[Mato Grosso]] was split into two states. The northern area retained the name Mato Grosso while the southern area became the state of [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], with [[Campo Grande]] as its capital. The new Mato Grosso do Sul incorporated the territory of Ponta Porã and the northern part of Iguaçu. Central Iguaçu went to [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], and southern Iguaçu went to [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]. In 1988, the northern portion of [[Goiás]] became the state of [[Tocantins]], with [[Palmas, Tocantins|Palmas]] as its capital.

The North region [[List of Brazilian states by area|covers 45.27% of the land area]] of Brazil, and has the [[List of Brazilian states by population|lowest number of inhabitants]]. With the exception of [[Manaus]], which hosts a tax-free industrial zone, and [[Belém]], the biggest metropolitan area of the region, it is fairly unindustrialized and undeveloped. It accommodates most of the rainforest vegetation of the world and many indigenous tribes.

The states of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]], and [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] all have a [[temperate climate]]. 

[[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] is the economic center of Brazil. Agriculture, industry, commerce, and services are the most diversified of Brazil. Although a large proportion is exported to other states and other countries, the consumer market of the state is also the biggest in the country. Different from other states, where settlement started in the coast and moved inwards, in São Paulo the center of the economy was in a non-coastal city.

[[Rio de Janeiro]], the most well known Brazilian city and with many famous landmarks, is the capital of the [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|state of Rio de Janeiro]]. Older books may still reference the [[state of Guanabara]]: after the Federal District (capital of the Republic) was moved to Brasília in 1960, the city of Rio de Janeiro was elevated to the condition of state of Guanabara (name of the large bay which washes the city or Rio); however, in 1975, Guanabara was incorporated to the state of Rio and returned to the condition of municipality, with the old name of city of Rio de Janeiro.

Brazilian science effectively began in the first decades of the 19th century, when the [[List of Portuguese monarchs|Portuguese Royal Family]], headed by [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]], arrived in [[Rio de Janeiro]], escaping from the [[Napoleon]]'s army invasion of [[Portugal]] in 1807. Until then, Brazil was a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] [[Colonial Brazil|colony]], without [[university|universities]], and a lack of cultural and scientific organizations, in stark contrast to the former American colonies of the [[Spanish Empire]], which although having a largely [[illiterate]] population like Brazil and Portugal, had, however, a number of universities since the 16th century.

Technological research in Brazil is largely carried out in public [[university|universities]] and research institutes. Nonetheless, more than 73% of funding for basic research still comes from government sources.<ref>{{cite web |title=Skills training for growth |url=http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/brasil_topics/science/categoria_view |author=Brazilian Government |accessdate=2007-08-10 }}</ref> Some of Brazil's most notables technological hubs are the [[Oswaldo Cruz Institute]], the [[Butantan Institute]], the Air Force's [[Brazilian General Command for Aerospace Technology (CTA)|Aerospace Technical Center]], the [[Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária|Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation]] and the [[INPE]].

Since the arrival of the Portuguese in the 1500's, this [[miscegenation]] between the three groups has been a part of the evolution of the people of Brazil. In the over three centuries of Portuguese colonization, Brazil received more than 700,000 Portuguese settlers and 4 million African slaves.<ref name="Encarta">{{cite encyclopedia | title = People and Society | encyclopedia = Encarta | publisher = MSN | url = http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761554342_3/Brazil.html | accessdate = 2008-06-10 }}</ref>

Starting in the late 19th century, Brazil opened its doors to [[Immigration in Brazil|immigration]]: people of over 60&nbsp;nationalities immigrated to Brazil. About 5&nbsp;million [[Europe]]an and [[Asia]]n immigrants arrived from 1870 to 1953, most of them from [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], and [[Germany]]. In the early 20th century, people from [[Japan]] and the [[Middle-East]] also arrived.<ref name="Encarta 2"/> The immigrants and their descendants had an important impact in the ethnic composition of the Brazilian population, and many [[diaspora]]s are present in the country.

The Federal Constitution and the 1996 ''[[Education in Brazil|General Law of Education in Brazil]]'' (LDB) determine how the Federal Government, States, Federal District, and Municipalities will manage and organize their respective education systems.<ref name="Constituição"/> Each of these public educational systems is responsible for its own maintenance, which manages funds as well as mechanisms and sources for financial resources.

===Language===
{{main|Languages of Brazil|Brazilian Portuguese}}
[[Image:Museu da Língua Portuguesa.jpg|right|thumb|[[Museum of the Portuguese Language]] in [[São Paulo]], the first language museum in the world.]]

Portuguese is the official language of Brazil.<ref name="CIA People"/> It is spoken by nearly the entire population and is virtually the only language used in [[newspaper]]s, [[radio]], [[television]], and for all business and administrative purposes, with the exception of [[Nheengatu]], an indigenous language of [[South America]] which has gained the co-official status alongside Portuguese in the municipality of [[São Gabriel da Cachoeira]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/international/americas/28amazon.html?ex=1282881600&en=2dbb31357d010164&ei=5090 Language Born of Colonialism Thrives Again in Amazon ] ''New York Times''.

[[Brazilian Portuguese]] has had its own development, influenced by the [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Amerindian]] and [[African languages]].<ref name="Portuguese"/> Due to this, the language is somewhat different from that spoken in [[Portugal]] and other Portuguese-speaking countries, mainly for phonological and orthographic differences. These differences are somewhat greater than those of [[American English|American]] and [[British English]].<ref name="Portuguese">{{cite web | title = Languages of Brazil | publisher = Ethnologue | url = http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=br | accessdate = 2008-06-09 }}</ref> [[As of 2008]], Portugal is considering reforming its own language to accommodate linguistic developments in the Brazilian Portuguese since the two languages diverged.<ref>{{cite news  | last = Nash | first = Elizabeth  | title = Portugal pays lip service to Brazil's supremacy | publisher = The Independent | date = 2008-05-02 | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/portugal-pays-lip-service-to-brazils-supremacy-819728.html | accessdate = 2008-06-09 }}</ref>

Minority languages are spoken throughout the vast national territory. Some of these are spoken by indigenous peoples: 180 [[Amerindian language]]s are spoken in remote areas. Others are spoken by immigrants and their descendants.<ref name="Portuguese"/> There are important communities of speakers of [[German language|German]] (mostly the [[Hunsrückisch]], part of the [[High German languages]]) and [[Italian language|Italian]] (mostly the [[Talian]] [[dialect]], of [[Venetian language|Venetian]] origin) in the south of the country, both largely influenced by the Portuguese language.<ref name="Portuguese"/><ref name="BGOW Port"/>

Until 1970, the majority of Brazilian Protestants were members of "traditional churches", mostly [[Lutheran]]s, [[Presbyterian]]s and [[Baptist]]s. Since then, numbers of [[Pentecostal]] and Neopentecostal members have increased significantly.<ref name="Encarta 5"/> Traditional African beliefs, brought by slaves, have blended with Catholicism to create Afro-Brazilian religions such as [[Macumba]], [[Candomblé]], and [[Umbanda]].<ref name="USDS"/> Amerindians practice a wide variety of indigenous religions that vary from group to group.<ref name="Encarta 5"/> [[Islam in Brazil]] was first practiced by African slaves.   Today, the 
Muslim population in Brazil is made up of mostly [[Arab]] immigrants. There 
are approximately fifty-five mosques and Muslim religious centers. A recent 
trend has been the increase in conversions to Islam among non-Arab 
citizens.<ref>http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71451.htm</ref>

According to the 2000 Demographic Census, 73.9% of the population is [[Roman Catholicism in Brazil|Roman Catholic]]; 15.4% is [[Protestantism in Brazil|Protestant]]; 0.91% from other Christian denominations; 1.33% follows [[Kardecist spiritism]]; 0.31% follows African traditional religions; 0.01% follows Amerindian traditions; 7.35% consider themselves [[Agnosticism|agnostics]], [[Atheism|atheists]] or without a religion; and 0.81% are members of other religions such as [[Buddhism]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam in Brazil|Islam]], and some practice a mixture of different religions.<ref>{{cite conference | title = Religion in Brazil | booktitle = 2000 Demographic Census | publisher = Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics | date = 2000 | url = http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/censo2000/populacao/religiao_Censo2000.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2008-06-08 }}</ref><ref name="CIA People"/>
