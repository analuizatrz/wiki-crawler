'''Nine Inch Nails''' (abbreviated as '''NI<!--Please do not use И; it is the Cyrillic letter I -->N''') is an American [[hard rock]] act, founded in 1988 by [[Trent Reznor]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. As its main [[Producer (music)|producer]], singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist, Reznor is the only official member of Nine Inch Nails and remains solely responsible for its direction.<ref name = "AMG" /> NIN's music straddles a wide range of genres, while retaining a characteristic sound using [[electronic instruments]] and processing. After recording a new album, Reznor usually assembles [[Nine Inch Nails live performances|a live band]] to perform with him. The touring band features a revolving lineup that often rearranges songs to fit a live setting. On stage, NIN often employ spectacular visual elements to accompany performances, which frequently culminate with the band [[Instrument destruction|destroying their instruments]].<ref name = "Reimink">{{cite news |last =Reimink |first= Troy |title= Changes in songs, lineup keep Nails sharp |publisher= ''[[Grand Rapids Press]]'' |pages= D1 |date= [[2007-03-05]]}}</ref>

[[Underground music]] audiences warmly received Nine Inch Nails in its early years. The band produced several highly influential records in the 1990s that achieved widespread popularity: many Nine Inch Nails songs became radio hits,<ref name = "BillboardHistory" /> two NIN recordings won [[Grammy Award]]s, and the band has sold over twenty million albums worldwide,<ref name="Yahoo!Court" /> with 11 million sales certified in the US alone.<ref name="RIAAbestsellers" /> In 1997, Reznor appeared in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's list of the year's most influential people, and ''Spin'' magazine described him as "the most vital artist in music."<ref name="Time">{{cite journal

In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed Nine Inch Nails at 94 on its list of the 100 greatest [[rock music|rock]] artists of all time.<ref name="Bowie" /> Despite this acclaim, the band has had several feuds with the corporate side of the recording industry. In 2007, these corporate entanglements resulted in Reznor announcing that Nine Inch Nails would split from its label and release future material independently.<ref name="BBFreeAgent" />

Since 1989, Nine Inch Nails has released eight major studio releases.  The most recent releases, ''[[Ghosts I–IV]]'' and ''[[The Slip (album)|The Slip]]'', both released in 2008, were released under [[Creative Commons]] licenses.  Both were initially released digitally, with physical releases coming later.  The digital release of ''The Slip'' was made available completely free of charge.  NIN has been nominated for ten [[Grammy Award]]s and won twice for the songs "[[Wish (song)|Wish]]" and "[[Happiness in Slavery]]", in 1992 and 1995 respectively.

==History==
===Formation===
[[Image:Nine Inch Nails logo.svg|thumb|right|The NIN logo designed by Reznor and [[Gary Talpas]]]]
In 1987, Trent Reznor played keyboards with a [[Cleveland]] band called the [[Exotic Birds]], then managed by [[John Malm, Jr.]].  Reznor and Malm became friends, and when Reznor left the Exotic Birds to work on music of his own, Malm informally became his manager.<ref>''Reznor v. J. Artist Management, Inc. et al.'', 365 F.

Koster agreed, commenting that it cost him "just a little wear on [his] tape heads".<ref>{{cite journal  |title= The music of rage |journal= [[People (magazine)|People]] |volume=43 |issue=5 |last=Dougherty |first= Steve |coauthors=Bryan Alexander, Tom Nugent, John Hannah |date= [[1995-02-06]] |pages=105–107}}</ref> While assembling these, the earliest Nine Inch Nails recordings, Reznor was unable to find a band that could articulate the material as he desired.  Instead, inspired by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], Reznor played all the instruments except drums himself.<ref>{{cite journal |title= The Truth About Trent |journal=Option |last=Fine |first=Jason |date=July/August 1994}}</ref> This role remains Reznor's on most of the band's studio recordings, though he has occasionally involved other musicians and assistants. In 1988, after playing its first shows supporting [[Skinny Puppy]], Reznor's ambitions for Nine Inch Nails were to release one [[12-inch single]] on a small European label.<ref name= "AP90">{{cite journal |title= Getting Down in It |month= March | year= 1990 |journal= [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] |issue= 27}}</ref> Several labels responded favorably to the demo material, and Reznor signed with [[TVT Records]].<ref name= "AMG" /> Nine selections from the Right Track demos were later released in revised form on the band's first full-length studio release, ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' in 1989.

Reznor said in 1994 that he coined the name "Nine Inch Nails" because it "abbreviated easily", rather than for "any literal meaning".<ref name = "Axcess">{{cite journal |title= Talking about Nothing with Trent Reznor |journal= Axcess |volume= 2 |year= 1994}}</ref> Other rumored explanations have circulated, alleging that Reznor chose to reference [[Jesus]]' crucifixion with nine-inch spikes,<ref name = "Shock">{{cite book |first= Greg |last= Rule |title= Electro Shock!: Groundbreakers of Synth Music |publisher= Backbeat Books |year= 1999 |id= ISBN 0-8793-0582-7}}</ref> or [[Freddy Krueger]]'s nine-inch fingernails.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.spin.com/features/magazine/columns/chuck_klosterman/2006/03/0603_chuck/ |title= Arriving late to the Nine Inch Nails party |last= Klosterman |first= Chuck |authorlink= Chuck Klosterman |publisher = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' |month= March | year= 1992 |accessdate = 2006-11-01}}</ref> The Nine Inch Nails' logo, which consists of the letters "NIИ" set inside a border, was designed by Reznor and [[Gary Talpas]].

===''Pretty Hate Machine''===
[[Image:Trent Reznor Lollapalooza 1991.jpg|thumb|Reznor during the 1991 [[Lollapalooza]] festival]]
Written, arranged, and performed by Trent Reznor, Nine Inch Nails' first album ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' debuted in 1989. It marked Reznor's first collaboration with [[Adrian Sherwood]] (who produced the lead single "Down in It" in [[London, England]] without having met Reznor face-to-face)<ref name = "AP90" /> and [[Flood (producer)|Mark "Flood" Ellis]]. Flood's production would appear on each major Nine Inch Nails release until 1994, and Sherwood has done remixes for the band as recently as 2000. Reznor and his co-producers expanded upon the Right Track Studio demos by adding singles "[[Head Like a Hole]]" and "[[Sin (Nine Inch Nails song)|Sin]]". ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s [[Michael Azerrad]] described the album as "industrial-strength noise over a pop framework" and "harrowing but catchy music";<ref name="RS Azerrad">{{cite journal |last= Azerrad |first= Michael |authorlink= Michael Azerrad |title= Nine Inch Nails |journal= [[Rolling Stone]] |year= 1990}}</ref> Reznor proclaimed this combination "a sincere statement" of "what was in [his] head at the time".<ref>{{cite journal |author= Martin, Steve |title= Nine Inch Nails |journal= [[Thrasher (magazine)|Thrasher]] |year= 1990}}</ref> After spending 113 weeks on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]],<ref name="PHM 200">{{cite web |title= The Billboard 200 - Pretty Hate Machine |publisher= ''Billboard'' |url= http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/chart_display.jsp?cfi=305&cfgn=Albums&cfn=The+Billboard+200&ci=3012164&cdi=6609861&cid=04%2F18%2F1992   |accessdate= 2007-10-08}}</ref> ''Pretty Hate Machine'' became one of the first [[Independent music|independently released]] records to attain [[RIAA certification|platinum certification]].<ref name="AMG" /> [[MTV]] aired videos for "Down in It" and "Head Like a Hole", but an explicit video for "Sin" was only released on the 1997 home video ''[[Closure (Nine Inch Nails VHS)|Closure]]''.

In 1990, NIN began the [[Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series]], in which they toured North America as an opening act for [[alternative rock]] artists such as [[Peter Murphy (musician)|Peter Murphy]] and [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]].<ref name="AMG" /> At some point, Reznor began smashing his equipment while on stage; ''Rockbeat'' interviewer Mike Gitter attributed NIN's early success in front of rock oriented audiences to this aggressive attitude.<ref name = "Rockbeat">{{cite journal |title= The man behind the machine |author= Gitter, Mike |journal= Rockbeat |year= 1992}}</ref> Nine Inch Nails then embarked on a world tour that continued through the first [[Lollapalooza]] festival in 1991, where the band "stole the show" despite numerous equipment problems.<ref name = "Huxley">{{cite book |last= Huxley |first= Martin |title= Nine Inch Nails: Self Destruct |year= 1997 |month= September |publisher= St. Martin's Griffin |id= ISBN 0-3121-5612-X}}</ref> After a poor European reception opening for [[Guns N' Roses]], NIN returned to America amid pressure from TVT to produce a follow-up to ''Pretty Hate Machine''. In response, Reznor secretly began recording under various pseudonyms to avoid record company interference.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Nine Inch Nails |journal= [[Musician (magazine)|Musician]] |month=March | year=1994}}</ref>

===''Broken''===
[[Image:Happiness in Slavery video.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bob Flanagan]] being tortured in the music video for "[[Happiness in Slavery]]"]]
In 1992 Nine Inch Nails released ''[[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|Broken]]'', an [[extended play|EP]] featuring six songs and two bonus tracks.  In the liner notes, Reznor credited the 1991 [[List of Nine Inch Nails live-band members|Nine Inch Nails touring band]] as an influence on the EP's sound. Reznor characterized ''Broken'' as a guitar-based "blast of destruction", and as "a lot harder [...] than ''Pretty Hate Machine''".<ref name="Shock" /> Songs from ''Broken'' have earned NIN its only two Grammy Awards: a performance of the EP's first single "[[Happiness in Slavery]]" from [[Woodstock '94]],<ref name = "AwardsDatabase" /> and the second single "[[Wish (song)|Wish]]".<ref name="AwardsDatabase" />

[[Peter Christopherson]] of the bands [[Coil (band)|Coil]] and [[Throbbing Gristle]] directed a performance video for "Wish",<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.9inchnails.com/gallery/wish.php |title= Wish |publisher= Painful Convictions |year= 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-07}}</ref> but the EP's most infamous video accompanied "Happiness in Slavery". The video was almost universally banned for its graphic depiction of [[performance art]]ist [[Bob Flanagan]] disrobing lying on a machine that pleasures, tortures, then kills him.<ref name="Stone94">{{cite journal |title= Love it to death |last=Gold |first=Jonathan |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |issue= 690 |pages= 50 |date=September 8, 1994}}</ref> A third video for "Pinion", partially incorporated into MTV's ''Alternative Nation'' opening sequence, showed a toilet that apparently flushes into the mouth of a person in [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.9inchnails.com/gallery/pinion.php |title= Pinion |publisher= Painful Convictions |year= 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-07}}</ref> Reznor and Christopherson compiled these three clips along with footage for "Help Me I Am In Hell" and "Gave Up" into a longform music video also called ''[[Broken (film)|Broken]]''. It depicts the murder of a young man who is kidnapped and tortured while forced to watch the videos. This footage was never officially released, but instead appeared covertly among tape trading circles.<ref name="Stone94" />

A separate performance video for "Gave Up" featuring [[Richard Patrick]] and [[Marilyn Manson]] was filmed at [[10050 Cielo Drive]] (then renamed "Le Pig studios" by Reznor), site of the [[Charles Manson#Tate murders|Tate murders]];<ref name = "AMG" /> a live recording of "Wish" was also filmed, and both videos appeared on the ''[[Closure (video)|Closure]]'' video compilation in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.9inchnails.com/gallery/gave-up.php |title= Gave Up |publisher= Painful Convictions |year= 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-07}}</ref> ''Broken'' was followed by the remix EP ''[[Fixed (EP)|Fixed]]'' in late 1992. Rather than tour in support of the new material, Reznor began living and recording full-time at Le Pig, working on a follow-up free of restrictions from his record label.

===''The Downward Spiral''===
[[Image:Closer Monkey.jpg|thumb|An image from the music video for "[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]"]]
Nine Inch Nails' second full-length album, ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'', entered the ''Billboard'' 200 in 1994 at number two,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cleveland.com/kidsnewsday/content.ssf?/homegrown/index.ssf?/homegrown/more/reznor/timeline.html |title= Trent Reznor: Timeline |publisher= Cleveland.com |accessdate= 2006-12-18}}</ref> and remains the highest-selling NIN release in the United States.<ref name="RIAA.com">{{cite web | url= http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |publisher= [[Recording Industry Association of America]] |title= Gold and Platinum database |accessdate= 2007-08-10}}</ref> Influenced by late-1970s rock albums ''[[Low (album)|Low]]'' and ''[[The Wall (album)|The Wall]]'', by [[David Bowie]] and [[Pink Floyd]] respectively, ''The Downward Spiral'' features a wide range of textures and moods to illustrate the mental progress of a central character.<ref name = "Details">{{cite journal |title= The art of darkness |last= Heath |first= Chris | authorlink = Chris Heath |journal= [[Details (magazine)|Details]] |month=April | year=1995}}</ref>  Flood once again co-produced several tracks on the album, though it proved to be his last collaboration with Nine Inch Nails.  Longtime Flood-collaborator [[Alan Moulder]] [[mix engineer|mixed]] most of ''The Downward Spiral'' and subsequently took on more extensive production duties for future NIN releases.

The album spawned two singles, "[[March of the Pigs]]" and "[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]", along with "[[Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song)|Hurt]]" and "Piggy" which were issued to radio without a commercial single release. The music video for "Closer" was directed by [[Mark Romanek]] and received frequent rotation on MTV, though the network made extensive edits to the original version, which they perceived to be graphic.<ref name="Closer video">{{cite web |title= Nine Inch Nails: Closure (VHS) |publisher= DeepFocus.com |url= http://www.deep-focus.com/flicker/closure.html |accessdate= 2007-08-26}}</ref>  A radio edit that partially mutes the song's explicit lyrics also received extensive airtime.<ref name= "BillboardHistory" />  The ''Closure'' video documented highlights from NIN's Self Destruct tour, including full live videos of "Eraser", "Hurt" and a [[Long take|one-take]] "March of the Pigs" clip made for MTV.

Critical response to ''The Downward Spiral'' has generally been favorable: in 2005 the album was ranked 25th in [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'']]'s list of the "100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005",<ref name="Spin100">{{cite journal |title= 100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005 |journal= [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |issue= June 2005}}</ref> and in 2003 ''Rolling Stone'' ranked the album number 200 on their "[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 greatest albums of all time]]" list.<ref name="200great500">{{cite web |title= The RS 500 Greatest Albums of All Time |publisher= ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' |date= [[2003-11-18]] |url= http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6599404/200_the_downward_spiral |accessdate= 2007-08-26}}</ref> After ''The Downward Spiral''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> release, Reznor produced an accompanying [[remix album]] entitled ''[[Further Down the Spiral]]'', the only non-major NIN release to be certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] in the United States.<ref name="RIAA.com" /> It featured contributions from electronic musician [[Aphex Twin]], producer [[Rick Rubin]], and former [[Jane's Addiction]] guitarist [[Dave Navarro]], among others.

The Self Destruct tour in support of the album reached its widest mainstream audience with a mud-drenched performance at [[Woodstock '94]] that was broadcast on [[Pay-Per-View]] and seen in as many as 24&nbsp;million homes.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16319994.html |title= Feedback muddy from Woodstock PPV |author= Umstead, R.

In 1997 Reznor produced the [[Lost Highway (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the [[David Lynch]] film ''[[Lost Highway]]''.  The release spawned the single "[[The Perfect Drug]]", the video for which was again directed by Mark Romanek.  A tenth anniversary deluxe reissue of ''The Downward Spiral'' was released in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |title= DualDisc format takes off |url= http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/davidbowie/articles/story/7207720/dualdisc_format_takes_off |publisher = [[Rolling Stone]].com |first= Brian |last= Hiatt |date= [[2005-03-25]] |accessdate= 2007-08-26}}</ref>

===''The Fragile''===
Five years elapsed between ''The Downward Spiral'' and NIN's next studio album, ''[[The Fragile]]'', which arrived as a [[double CD]] in September 1999.<ref name= "Bleak" /> On the heels of the band's previous successes, media anticipation surrounded ''The Fragile'' more than a year before its release,<ref>{{cite news |title= NIN Album on Horizon |work= Daily News Online |date= August 1998}}</ref> when it was already described as "oft-delayed".<ref>{{cite journal |title= Nine Inch Nails - Ball of confusion |journal = [[Hit Parader]] |month= September | year= 1998 |last= Hargrove |first= Brandon}}</ref> When the album was finally released, it debuted at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200, selling 228,000 copies in its first week and receiving favorable reviews.<ref name= "Bleak"/> ''Spin'' hailed ''The Fragile'' as the "album of the year", and several songs from it were regular features on alternative rock radio stations.<ref>{{cite news |title= Rock radio pumps up volume |author = Kaufman, Gil |work = SonicNet News |date=[[1999-12-02]] |accessdate= 2006-10-28}}</ref> However, the album slipped out of the ''Billboard'' Top 10 only a week after its release, and Reznor funded the subsequent North American tour out of his own pocket.<ref name="Bleak">{{cite journal | title= Rock's outlook bleak, but this Nail won't bend | author= Soeder, John |journal = Cleveland.com |date=[[2000-04-09]]}}</ref>

According to Reznor, ''The Fragile'' was conceived by making "songwriting and arranging and production and sound design [...] the same thing. A song would start with a drum loop or a visual and eventually a song would emerge out of it and that was the song."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mtv.com/bands/n/nin/news_feature_050509/index2.jhtml |title= The upward spiral |publisher= [[MTV.com]] |author= Moss, Corey |month= May | year= 2005 |accessdate= 2006-12-18}}</ref> Canadian rock producer [[Bob Ezrin]] was consulted on the album's track listing; the liner notes state that he "provided final continuity and flow."

Before the album's release, the song "[[Starfuckers, Inc.]]" provoked media speculation about whom Reznor had intended its acerbic lyrics to satirize.<ref>{{cite news |title= Provocative, pounding new NIN songs leaked to radio |author = Kaufman, Gil |work = SonicNet News |date= [[1999-07-14]] |accessdate= 2006-10-28}}.</ref> [[Cinesexuality]] critic Patricia MacCormack interprets the song as a "scathing attack on the alternative music scene", particularly Reznor's former friend and protégé Marilyn Manson.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.popmatters.com/music/videos/n/nin-starfuckers.shtml |title=All the fun of the (not so) fair |last= MacCormack |first= Patricia |publisher=[[PopMatters]] |accessdate= 2007-08-26}}</ref> The two artists put aside their differences when Manson appeared in the song's music video, retitled "Starsuckers, Inc." and performed on stage with NIN at [[Madison Square Garden]] in 2000.<ref name="Machian">{{cite news

Reznor followed ''The Fragile'' with another remix album, ''[[Things Falling Apart]]'', released after the 2000 ''Fragility'' tour, which itself was recorded and released on CD, DVD, and VHS in 2002 as ''[[And All that Could Have Been]]''.

Nine Inch Nails' fifth studio album, ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]'', was released only two years after ''With Teeth'', a marked change in pace from the release of previous albums.  With lyrics written from the perspective of multiple fictitious characters, Reznor described ''Year Zero'' as a [[concept album]] criticizing the [[United States government]]'s current policies and how they will impact the world 15 years in the future.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gigwise.com/news.asp?contentid=29753 |title=Trent Reznor Blasts the American Government |publisher=Gigwise.com |first=Jason |last=Gregory |date=[[2007-03-26]] |accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref> Critical response to the album was generally favorable, with an average rating of 76% on [[MetaCritic]].<ref name="MetaCritic">{{cite web

On February 16, 2008, Reznor posted a news update on the Nine Inch Nails website entitled "2 weeks." On March 2, ''[[Ghosts I–IV]]'' was released, a 36-track instrumental album. ''Ghosts I–IV'' continued Reznor's experimentation with digital distribution, as the album was released online before physical copies were available.  Like [[Saul Williams]]' ''[[The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!]]'' (which Reznor helped produce),<ref name="Pitchfork" /> the album is available in a number of different formats and forms, including a free download of the first volume, a [[USD|$]]5 digital download, a $10 double CD set, a $75 deluxe edition set, and a $300 Ultra-Deluxe limited edition package, which sold out all 2500 copies (grossing $750,000) in three days.<ref>{{cite web

== Musical characteristics ==
{{Inline audio|section}}
[[Image:NineInchNails.jpg|thumb|left|Nine Inch Nails live on tour in 2005]]
[[Allmusic]]'s Steve Huey states that "Nine Inch Nails were the most popular [[Industrial music|industrial]] group ever and were largely responsible for bringing the music to a mass audience."<ref name="AMG" /> Reznor has never referred to his own work as industrial music, but admits to borrowing techniques from such early industrial bands as [[Throbbing Gristle]] and [[Test Dept.]]<ref name="Axcess" /> Despite the disparity between those artists initially operating under the term "industrial" and Nine Inch Nails, it has become common in journalistic descriptions of Reznor's body of work to describe it as such. Reznor acknowledged in ''Spin'' magazine that "[[Down in It]]" was influenced by early [[Skinny Puppy]], particularly their song "[[Dig It (single)|Dig It]]", other songs from ''Pretty Hate Machine'' were described in the same interview as [[synth-pop]].<ref>{{cite journal |title= Sympathy for the devil |journal= [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |month=March | year=1996}}</ref> Reviewing ''[[The Fragile]]'', critic Steve Cooper noted that the album juxtaposes widely varied genres, such as solo piano in "The Frail" and [[drum and bass]] elements in "[[Starfuckers, Inc.]]"<ref>{{cite web |title= NIN's new effort threads the line between beauty and destruction |first= Steve |last= Cooper |publisher= The Cavalier Daily |url= http://www.cavalierdaily.com/CVArticle.asp?ID=768&pid=469 |date= [[1999-09-24]] |accessdate= 2007-08-26}}</ref>

Certain techniques and styles can be found throughout NIN's catalog. Songs such as "Wish" ({{audio-nohelp|Wish.ogg|sample}}) and "[[The Day the World Went Away]]" ({{audio-nohelp|TDtWWA.ogg|sample}}) exhibit changes in [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], changing from quiet to loud and back again, and end with an abrupt stop. Reznor's singing follows a similar pattern, frequently moving from whispers to screams. The band's music also occasionally features complex [[time signatures]], notably in "The Collector", from ''With Teeth'',<ref name = "PopMatters review">{{cite web |url= http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/n/nineinchnails-withteeth.shtml |title= "Nine Inch Nails: With Teeth" |publisher= [http://www.popmatters.com/ PopMatters] |author= Schiller, Mike |date= [[2005-05-18]] |accessdate= 2006-12-20}}</ref> and concert favorite "[[March of the Pigs]]".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20050405/ai_n13498487 |title= Arts reviews: Nine Inch Nails |work= [[The Independent]] |date=[[2005-04-05]] |author= Nash, Rob |accessdate= 2006-12-20}}  Archived at [http://www.findarticles.com/ FindArticles.com].</ref> Reznor also uses [[Noise (audio)|noise]] and distortion in his song arrangements, and incorporates [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] with [[chromatic]] melody and/or harmony. These techniques are all used in the song "[[Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song)|Hurt]]" ({{audio-nohelp|Hurt.ogg|sample}}), which features a highly dissonant [[tritone]] played on guitar during the verses, a B5#11, emphasized when Reznor sings the [[eleventh]] note on the word "I" every time the B/F [[Dyad (music)|dyad]] is played.<ref>{{cite book |author= Reynolds, Tom |title= I Hate Myself and I Want to Die |pages= 227 |id= ISBN 978-1860746284 |date= [[2005-06-13]] |publisher= Sanctuary Publishing}}</ref> "[[Closer (song)|Closer]]" ({{audio-nohelp|Closer.ogg|sample}}) concludes with a chromatic piano [[Motif (music)|motif]]: the same melody that first appears during the chorus of ''Heresy'', and then recurs on the title track of ''The Downward Spiral''.<ref name = "PopMatters review" /> On ''The Fragile'', Reznor revisits this technique of repeating a motif multiple times throughout different songs, either on a different musical instrument, with a transposed harmony, or in an altered tempo.<ref>{{cite web |title= The Fragile |publisher= Lollipop Online |url=http://www.lollipop.com/archive_temp.php3?content=issue50/50-04a-13.php3 |month= May | year= 2000 |author= Marburger, Lex |accessdate= 2006-12-20}}</ref>

== Influence ==
Nine Inch Nails has influenced many newer artists, which according to Reznor range from "generic imitations" dating from NIN's initial success to younger bands echoing his style in a "truer, less imitative way".<ref>{{cite journal |title= Geoff Rickly interviews Trent Reznor |last= Rickly |first= Geoff |authorlink= Geoff Rickly |journal= Alternative Press |date= [[2004-06-26]]}}</ref> Following the release of ''The Downward Spiral'', mainstream artists began to take notice of Nine Inch Nails' influence: David Bowie compared NIN's impact to that of [[The Velvet Underground]].<ref name= "Bowie">{{cite journal |title= Nine Inch Nails |last= Bowie |first= David |authorlink=David Bowie |journal= Rolling Stone |issue=972 |date=[[2005-04-21]] |url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7250012/94_nine_inch_nails |accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref> In 1997, Reznor appeared in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's list of the year's most influential people, and ''Spin'' magazine described him as "the most vital artist in music".<ref name="Time">{{cite journal |title= Time's 25 most influential Americans |journal= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= [[1997-04-21]] |volume=149 |issue=16 |pages= 66}}</ref> The [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] certified sales for 10.5 million units of the band's albums in the United States,<ref name="RIAAbestsellers">{{cite web |url= http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=3&table=tblTopArt&action=|title= Best Sellers: Gold & Platinum Top Artists |publisher= [[Recording Industry Association of America]] |date= [[2006-07-31]] |accessdate= 2007-02-05}}</ref> which accounts for roughly half of the band's reported sales worldwide.<ref name="Yahoo!Court">{{cite web | last = Amter | first = Charlie | title = Reznor Bares Teeth in Court | publisher = [[Yahoo!

{{seealso|List of Nine Inch Nails tours|List of Nine Inch Nails live-band members}}
Trent Reznor is the sole official member of Nine Inch Nails. However, Reznor has typically formed a backing group of musicians to perform the songs in a live setting. This live band, also known as Nine Inch Nails, rearranges the band's studio catalog and creates a different sound than that of Reznor's studio recordings.<ref name="Industrial Introspection">{{cite journal | title = Industrial Introspection | last = Branwyn | first = Gareth | authorlink = Gareth Branwyn | publisher = ''[[Mondo 2000]]'' | issue = 5 | date = [[1991-06-19]]}}</ref> Band members have occasionally been invited to participate in the recording process, but creative control within the studio has always been exclusively with Reznor. 

The band [[Tapeworm (band)|Tapeworm]] was created in 1995 as a Nine Inch Nails side-project between Reznor and various live-band members as a more "democratic" creative environment.<ref>{{cite magazine

The lineup of the live band has a tendency to change drastically between major tours: aside from Reznor remaining on lead vocals and guitar, no member of the live band has remained constant since its inception. Reznor cited the long gestation period between studio albums as part of the reason for these frequent personnel changes.<ref>{{cite episode |title= Trent Reznor talks to Ian Camfield |network= [[Xfm London]] |airdate=2005-07-22}}</ref> The 2008 incarnation of the live band will feature Reznor with [[Alessandro Cortini]], [[Robin Finck]], [[Josh Freese]], and [[Justin Meldal-Johnsen]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nastylittleman.com/pressreleases/040408nin.html |title= Nine Inch Nails Confirms Touring Lineup |publisher=Nasty Little Man |date= [[2008-04-04]] |accessdate= 2008-04-09}}</ref>

==Corporate entanglements==
Trent Reznor is an outspoken critic of the music industry, particularly corporate influence on his artistic freedom. As a result, Nine Inch Nails has clashed with several corporations, culminating in a decision to proceed as a free agent without any recording label contracts.

In the early 1990s, Nine Inch Nails was involved in a much-publicized feud with TVT Records, the first record label to sign the band. Reznor objected to the label's attempted interference with his intellectual property.<ref name = "Shock" /> Ultimately, they entered into a joint venture with Interscope Records in which Reznor forfeited a portion of his publishing rights to TVT Music in exchange for the freedom of having his own [[Nothing Records]] imprint.<ref name = "Huxley" /> In 2005, Reznor sued his former friend and manager John Malm, co-founder of Nothing, for fraud, breach of contract and fiduciary duty, and other claims.<ref>{{cite journal |title= NIN's Reznor: I was duped by my manager |date= [[2005-05-17]] |journal= [[Associated Press]]}} </ref> Their relationship was formally severed in a New York courtroom, with damages awarded to Reznor in excess of three million US dollars.<ref name = "E! Online">{{cite web |url= http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=0d53d346-74a1-496c-a624-3ce5e8054ae4 |title= Reznor bails on MTV, nails manager |author= Amter, Charlie |publisher= [[E! Online]] |date= [[2005-05-27]] |accessdate= 2006-11-28}}</ref>

At the behest of [[Prudential Financial|Prudential Securities]] bankruptcy proceedings, TVT put the rights to Reznor's recordings for the label on auction in 2005. This offer included the whole TVT catalog, including ''Pretty Hate Machine'' and a percentage of royalties from Reznor's song publishing company, Leaving Hope Music/TVT Music. [[Rykodisc]], which did not win the auction but was able to license the rights from Prudential, re-issued the out-of-print ''Pretty Hate Machine'' CD on November 22, 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://theninhotline.net/news/archives/backissue.php?y=05&m=10#1130439320 |title= Rykodisk to reissue pretty hate machine *updated* |publisher=The NIN Hotline |date= [[2005-10-27]] |accessdate= 2006-11-28}}</ref> Ryko also reissued the "Head Like a Hole" CD and a vinyl edition of ''Pretty Hate Machine'' in 2006. The label considered releasing a deluxe edition, just as Interscope had done for ''The Downward Spiral''; however, Reznor declined to produce it for them without payment.<ref name = "Toronto Sun">{{cite news |url= http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/N/Nine_Inch_Nails/2005/11/07/1296952.html |title= Reznor grits his teeth |author= Ladouceur, Liisa |work= [[The Toronto Sun]] |date= [[2005-11-08]] |accessdate= 2008-05-14}}</ref>

Nine Inch Nails was scheduled to perform at the 2005 [[MTV Movie Awards]], but withdrew from the show due to a disagreement with the network over the use of an unaltered image of [[George W. Bush]] as a backdrop to the band's performance of "[[The Hand that Feeds]]". Soon afterwards, Reznor wrote on the official NIN website: "apparently, the image of our president is as offensive to MTV as it is to me."<ref name= "E! Online" /> MTV replied that it respected Reznor's point of view, but was "uncomfortable" with the performance being "built around partisan political statements". A performance by [[Foo Fighters]] replaced NIN's time slot on the show.<ref name="MTV Awards">{{cite web |url= http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1503082/story.jhtml |last= Montgomery |first= James |title= Nine Inch Nails Drop Out Of MTV Movie Awards Over Bush Dispute |publisher= MTV.com |date= [[2005-05-27]] |accessdate= 2007-08-20}}</ref>

In 2006, after being alerted by a fan website, Reznor issued a [[cease and desist]] to [[Fox News Channel]] for using three songs from ''The Fragile'' on air without permission. The songs "La Mer", "The Great Below", and "The Mark Has Been Made" appeared in an episode of ''[[War Stories with Oliver North]]'' detailing the [[battle of Iwo Jima]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://theninhotline.net/news/archives/backissue.php?y=06&m=10#1161617908 |title= Fox News, War Stories, and Nine Inch Nails |publisher=The NIN Hotline |date= [[2006-10-23]] |accessdate= 2006-11-29}}</ref> A post appeared on Reznor's blog, which read: "Thanks for the Fox News heads-up.

As part of the alternate reality game which accompanied the release of ''Year Zero'', three tracks from the album were intentionally "leaked" prior to their official release at a number of NIN concerts on [[USB flash drive]]s.<ref name="CoolerThanLost" /> The high-quality audio files quickly circulated the internet, and owners of websites hosting the files soon received cease and desist orders from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], despite the fact that the viral campaign, and the use of USB drives, was sanctioned by Nine Inch Nails' record label.<ref name="BillboardPaolette">{{cite web |last= Paoletta |first= Michael |title= Online Odyssey Stoking Interest In New NIN Album |publisher= ''Billboard'' |date = [[2007-03-30]] |url= http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003565585 |accessdate= 2007-05-20}}</ref> The source that broke the story was quoted as saying "These fucking idiots are going after a campaign that the label signed off on."<ref name="BillboardPaolette" />

===Disputes with Universal Music Group===
In May 2007, Reznor made a post on the official Nine Inch Nails website condemning [[Universal Music Group]] (parent company of Nine Inch Nails's record label, [[Interscope Records]]) for their pricing and distribution plans for ''Year Zero.''<ref name="RollingStoneKreps">{{cite web |last= Kreps |first= Daniel |title= Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor Slams Records Labels for Sorry State of the Industry |publisher= [[Rolling Stone]] |date= [[2007-05-14]] |url= http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/05/14/nine-inch-nails-trent-reznor-slams-records-labels-for-sorry-state-of-the-industry/ |accessdate= 2007-05-19}}</ref> He criticized the company's retail pricing of ''Year Zero'' in Australia as "ABSURD," concluding that "as a reward for being a 'true fan' you get ripped off." Reznor went on to say that as "the climate grows more and more desperate for record labels, their answer to their mostly self-inflicted wounds seems to be to screw the consumer over even more."<ref name="UMG">{{cite web |url= http://www.nin.com/tr |accessdate=2007-08-22 |last= Reznor |first= Trent |title= Updates from Trent |date=[[2007-05-13]] |publisher= Nine Inch Nails |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070517041353rn_1/nin.com/tr/ |archivedate=2007-05-17}}</ref> Reznor's post, specifically his criticism of the recording industry at large, elicited considerable media attention.<ref name="Reznor Smashes UMG">{{cite web |title= Reznor Smashes UMG, Websites Write About It |publisher=The NIN Hotline |date= [[2007-05-17]] |url= http://www.theninhotline.net/news/archives/backissue.php?y=07&m=5#1179461909 |accessdate= 2007-05-19}}</ref> In September 2007, Reznor continued his attack on UMG at a concert in Australia, urging fans there to "steal" his music online instead of purchasing it legally.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/web/steal-away-steal-steal-and-steal-some-more/2007/09/18/1189881482912.html |title= Nails frontman urges fans to steal music |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=2007-09-18 |accessdate=2007-09-18 |last=Moses |first=Asher}}</ref> Reznor went on to encourage the crowd to "steal and steal and steal some more and give it to all your friends and keep on stealin'."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theninhotline.net/news/archives/backissue.php?y=07&m=9#1189989696 |title=Trent follows up on Universal AU |publisher=The NIN Hotline |date=2007-09-16 |accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref>

Reznor announced on October 8, 2007 that Nine Inch Nails had fulfilled its contractual commitments to Interscope Records and was now free to proceed as a "totally free agent, free of any recording contract with any label".<ref name="BBFreeAgent">{{cite web |author= Cohen, Jonathan |url= http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003655498 |title= Nine Inch Nails Celebrates Free Agent Status|accessdate= 2007-10-08 |publisher= ''Billboard'' |date= [[2007-10-08]]}}</ref> Reznor also speculated that he would release the next NIN album online in a similar fashion to ''[[The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!]]'', which he produced.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[New York Magazine]] |author= Westhoff, Ben |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/10/trent_reznor_and_saul_williams.html |title=Trent Reznor and Saul Williams discuss their new collaboration... |date=[[2007-10-30]] |accessdate=2007-10-31}}</ref>

Via another post on the official NIN website, Reznor again openly criticized Universal Music Group for preventing him from launching an official interactive fan remix website. Universal declined to host the site just days before its scheduled launch, citing the potential "accusation", in Reznor's words, "that they are sponsoring the same technical violation of copyright they are suing [other media companies] for".<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Rolling Stone |author=Kreps, Daniel |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/11/20/trent-reznor-puts-new-nin-site-on-hold-warns-of-apocalyptical-lawsuit/ |title=Trent Reznor puts new NIN site on hold |date=[[2007-11-20]] |accessdate=2007-11-21}}</ref> Reznor wrote in response that he was "challenged at the last second to find a way of bringing this idea to life without getting splashed by the urine as these media companies piss all over each other's feet".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/music-industry/universals-legal-tangles-with-youtube-kill-official-nine-inch-nails-fan-remix-site-326634.php |publisher=Gizmodo |title=Universal's Legal Tangles With YouTube Kill Official Nine Inch Nails Fan Remix Site |date=[[2007-11-26]] |accessdate=2008-01-29}}</ref> Despite these obstacles, the remix website was launched on November 27, 2007.
