'''Ewart Frederick Brown Jr.''' (born [[1944]]) is the [[List of Premiers of Bermuda|Premier]] of [[Bermuda]], leader of the [[Progressive Labour Party (Bermuda)|Progressive Labour Party (PLP)]], Minister of Tourism and Transport in the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|Cabinet]], and Member of Parliament for the constituency of Warwick South Central. 

Brown was elected leader of the ruling Progressive Labour Party on [[October 30]], [[2006]], defeating his predecessor, [[William Alexander Scott|Alex Scott]], at a PLP gathering. He is the third leader of the PLP since the party won the last general election in 2003.

Brown is also a [[physician]] and director of Bermuda Healthcare Services.

==Early life==

Brown was born in Bermuda to Ewart Sr. and Helene Brown of [[Flatts Village, Bermuda|Flatts]].  He attended the public Central School (today known as Victor Scott Primary) in [[Pembroke Parish, Bermuda|Pembroke]] until the age of 11, after which he was awarded a government scholarship to attend [[Berkeley Institute]].  Difficulties in school led him to instead attend the Technical Institute, and eventually be sent off by his parents to live with his aunt in [[Jamaica]].  While there, he excelled in sports, particularly [[cricket]] and [[Athletics (track and field)|track & field]], and represented that country in the 400-yard sprint.

Brown's sporting achievements led him to university in the [[United States of America]].  The [[University of Illinois]] offered him a scholarship, but Brown chose instead to attend [[Howard University]], a historically black university in [[Washington, D.C.]].  In 1966, he represented Bermuda at the [[Commonwealth Games]], reaching the second round of the 400-yard dash.  As a student leader, he was a vocal figure during the [[1968 Washington, DC riots|Washington riots]], speaking alongside campus radicals and [[Black_Panther_Party|Black Panther]] leaders such as [[Stokely Carmichael]].  Brown later graduated with letters for [[football (soccer)|football]] and track & field, and a Bachelor's degree in Chemistry.

Inspired by his uncle, G.B. McPhee, a practising physician, Brown decided to continue his education and become a doctor.  He earned an [[M.D.]] from Howard's College of Medicine, and moved to [[Los Angeles]] to pursue a [[Master of Public Health]] from the [[University of California, Los Angeles|University of California]].  His key areas of study included family medicine, population control and international health.  Brown remained in Los Angeles, adopting US citizenship and opening a medical practice, the Vermont Century Medical Clinic, in 1974.

Between 1977 and 1984, he received a string of awards spaced at about two-year intervals.  In 1977 he received the Physicians Recognition Award from the [[American Medical Association]], followed by the Grassroots Health Award from the Sons of [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts California]] in 1979.  In 1982 the Dubois Academic Institute conferred its Community Leadership Award.  The [[NAACP]] acknowledged Brown with its Pacesetter Award in 1984.

Brown became a director for the Marcus Garvey School, a [[K-8]] school in Los Angeles, which named him Humanitarian of the Year in 1991.  He also spent time as an assistant professor in the Department of Family Practice at the [[Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science]].

==Political life==
{{Politics of Bermuda}}
At the urging of then-PLP leader L. F. Wade, Brown returned to Bermuda and became involved in local politics in 1993.  The same year, he ran as a PLP candidate in the [[Warwick, Bermuda|Warwick]] West constituency.  In the previous election, Warwick West's two seats were won by Quinton L. Edness and John H. Sharpe of the [[United Bermuda Party]] (UBP), and the two were prepared to win again.  Brown managed to dominate the early vote counts, and ended only two votes behind Edness in the final count.  While he had not outright won, he did manage to take Sharpe's seat in [[Parliament of Bermuda|Parliament]].

In the following general election in 1998, Brown again won one of the Warwick West seats, and was joined by another PLP candidate during the PLP's unprecedented victory over the UBP.  With the PLP in control of parliament, Brown was appointed to cabinet as the minister of transport.

As minister of transport, Brown oversees the public bus system, taxis, marine ports and [[ferries]], vehicle licensing, and aviation. He introduced a number of reforms, including the replacement of the island's obsolescent ferries with faster, 205-seat catamarans, the ''Serenity'' and the ''Resolute'', in 2002.[http://www.theroyalgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020604/NEWS/106040009].  In May of that year, he clashed with the taxi industry over his proposed legislation to require a [[GPS]]-based central despatching system, which was eventually passed into law four years later.

Air arrivals at [[Bermuda International Airport]] increased by 15 percent since the introduction of [[Low-cost carrier|low cost airline]] service in 2004, reversing a twenty-year decline from the 1980s. 

Following the PLP's second general election victory in July 2003, Brown led an internal power struggle in the PLP against Premier [[Jennifer M. Smith]].  A compromise between the factions of the party led to Smith being replaced by [[William Alexander Scott]] and Brown being named deputy premier, and later adding the Ministry of Tourism to his responsibilities.  

As minister of tourism, Brown has announced plans for new hotels, the first hotel development in Bermuda since the 1970s, raising objections over environmental concerns.

In 2004, Brown clashed with the US Consulate over what was alleged to be a "gross violation" of security at the Bermuda International Airport, when he was said to have avoided security screening procedures.  Brown denied the claim, and criticised the Consulate for making the issue public.  [http://www.theroyalgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040511/NEWS/105110030]  Subsequently, the Bermuda Governmented amended its rules to allow the premier's limousine to drive directly to the plane bypassing air terminal security. 

On [[October 12]], [[2006]], Brown resigned from cabinet to make a second bid for leadership.  At a previously scheduled party delegates conference on the evening of October 27, he managed to defeat incumbent Scott by 107 to 76, and was sworn in as premier on October 30.  When he reshuffled the cabinet, he reclaimed the tourism and transportation portfolios and became, in addition to premier, the minister of tourism and transport.

Brown is married to Wanda Henton Brown and has four sons from a previous marriage. His mother was a member of parliament for the UBP, as was his aunt, Gloria Juanita McPhee, who became Bermuda's first female member cabinet minister.

===On race===
*"A [[plantation]] question is for me a question which conjures up images of the plantation: of a master-servant relationship, a man-boy relationship. A question that would be asked of a black politician and not a white one.  I will continue to indicate to reporters if that is what a question is.”[http://www.theroyalgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061128/NEWS/111280162]
*“It is a question that conjures up for me images of the plantation where the relationship between owner and servant is man and boy. A plantation question is a question that is rarely asked of a white politician.”[http://www.theroyalgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060417/NEWS/104170114]

===On the [[Governor of Bermuda]]===
*"I asked if there was a way to raise the profile of the governor with respect to some of the issues of the [[Bermuda Police Service|Police]], when people are criticising the performance of the Police or suggesting the way things could be changed operationally.  The governor has always said he's been involved – I would like to have him more involved publicly.  There have been a few instances when we feel he has been a little more hands-on – making direct contact with [[civil service]].  We take exception to that but I think we can work that out."[http://www.theroyalgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061124/NEWS/111240149]
*"We want to clarify our position that we are not interested in sending any criteria for any future governors for selection for the reason we don't think it is our responsibility.  [The British government] should send whoever they want to send."[http://www.theroyalgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061123/NEWS/111230132]
