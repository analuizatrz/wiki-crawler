'''Gongsun Long''' ({{zh-tpw|t=公孫龍|p=''Gōngsūn Lóng''|w=''Kung-sun Lung''}}, ca. 320 BC–250 BC<ref name="mcgreal">McGreal, Ian P. "Gongun Long" in ''Great Thinkers of the Eastern World''. New York: Harper Collins, 1995. Page 31</ref>) was a member of the [[Logicians]] school of ancient [[Chinese philosophy]]. He also ran a school and enjoyed the support of rulers, and supported peaceful means of resoving disputes in contrast to the wars which were common in the period (the so-called [[Warring States Period]]). However, little is known about the particulars of his life, and furthermore many of his writings have been lost.<ref name="mcgreal"/> All of his extant essays are included in the book '''''Gongsun Longzi''''' ({{zh-tpw|t=公孫龍子|p=''Gōngsūn Lóngzǐ''|w=''Kung-sun Lung Tzu''}}).

He is best known for a series of [[paradox]]es in the tradition of [[Hui Shi]]. His most famous work is ''[[White Horse Dialogue]]'' (《白馬論》), structured as conversation between two parties, with one party proclaiming truth in the statement and the other questioning.  The argument plays upon the dual semantic meanings of informal language, in particular the dual interpretations of 'is', being either:
#"Is a member of the class entitled (x)"
#"Is identical to concept (x)"
Thus a white horse is not a horse, because the concept of a white horse is not the same as the concept of a horse.

Two other paradoxes attributed to him are:
* Only the features of things can be pointed out (named), and yet the world (and other wholes) can be named even though the world (or a whole thing) is not itself a feature of anything.
* One and one cannot become two, since neither becomes two.<ref>McGreal, Ian P. "Gongun Long" in ''Great Thinkers of the Eastern World''. New York: Harper Collins, 1995. Page 33</ref>
