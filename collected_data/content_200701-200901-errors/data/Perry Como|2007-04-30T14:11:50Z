'''Pierino Ronald "Perry" Como''' ([[May 18]] [[1912]] &ndash; [[May 12]] [[2001]]) was an American [[crooner]]. During a career spanning more than half a century he recorded exclusively for the [[RCA Victor]] label after signing with it in 1943. He sold millions of records for RCA and also pioneered a weekly musical variety television show, which set the standards for the genre and proved to be one of the most successful in television history. His combined success on television and popular recordings was not matched by any other artist of the time. 

A popular [[television]] [[performer]] and [[recording artist]], Perry Como produced numerous hit records with record sales so high the label literally stopped counting at Como's behest. His weekly television shows and seasonal specials were broadcast throughout the world and his popularity seemingly had no geographical or language boundaries. He was equally at ease in live performance and in the confines of a recording studio. His appeal spanned generations and he was widely respected for both his professional standards and the conduct in his personal life. In the official [[RCA Records]] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Magazine]]'' memorial, his life was summed up in these few words: "50 years of music and a life well lived. An example to all."

Well known [[United States|American]] composer [[Ervin Drake]] said of him, " . . . occasionally someone like Perry comes along and won't 'go with the flow' and still prevails in spite of all the bankrupt others who surround him and importune him to yield to their values. Only occasionally."

Perry Como received the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1989, and was inducted into the [[Long Island Music Hall of Fame]] in 2006.

==Personal life==
Como, an [[Italian American]], was born in [[Canonsburg, Pennsylvania]], 20 miles south of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], the middle child of 13 children. Although he always liked to sing, his first great ambition was to be the best [[barber]] in Canonsburg. After graduation from high school, he opened his own barber-shop. In [[1933]], he married his teenage sweetheart, [[Roselle Belline]], whom he had met at a picnic in [[1929]] when he was just 16. They remained married until her death in [[August 1998]] at age 84. Como was reportedly devastated by her passing.

==Professional singer==

In [[1933]] Como joined [[Freddy Carlone]]'s band in [[Ohio]], and three years later moved up to [[Ted Weems]]' Orchestra and his first recording dates. Their first recording was a novelty tune called "You Can't Pull the Wool Over My Eyes", recorded for the [[Decca Records]] label.

In [[1942]] Weems dissolved his band, and Como went on to [[CBS]], where he sang for a couple of years without any conspicuous success. By this time the erstwhile barber had decided to return to Canonsburg, his family, and his barbering. Just as he was about to abandon his singing career once and for all, two [[NBC]] producers stepped in, returning him to show business for the NBC radio program ''[[Chesterfield Supper Club]]''. Later he became a very successful performer in theater and nightclub engagements.

In [[1945]], Como recorded the pop ballad "Till the End of Time" (based on [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]]'s "Polonaise in A-Flat"), which marked the beginning of a highly successful career. Como was the first artist to have ten records sell more than one million copies. Similarly,  his television show achieved a much higher rating than that of any other vocalist to date.

Como had, according to Joel Whitburn's compilations of the U.S. Pop Charts, fourteen U.S. #1 singles: "Till The End Of Time" (1945); "Prisoner Of Love" (1946); "Surrender" (1946); "Chi-Baba, Chi-Baba" (1947); " A - You're Adorable" (1949); "[[Some Enchanted Evening]]" (1949); "Hoop-De-Doo" (1950); "If" (1951); "Don't Let The Stars Get In Your Eyes" (1952); "No Other Love" (1953); "Wanted" (1954); "[[Hot Diggity (Dog Ziggity Boom)]]" (1956); "Round And Round" (1957); and "Catch A Falling Star" (1958).

On March 14, 1958, the [[RIAA]] certified Como's hit single, "Catch a Falling Star" as its first ever "[[Gold Record]]." Como won the 1958 [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Vocal Performance, Male|Best Vocal Performance, male]] for "Catch a Falling Star." His final Top 40 hit was a cover of [[Don McLean]]'s "[[And I Love You So]]", recorded in [[1973]].

He recorded many [[album]]s of songs for the RCA Victor label between [[1952]] and [[1987]], and is credited with numerous [[gold record]]s. Como had so many recordings achieve gold-record status that he refused to have many of them certified. It was this characteristic which made him so different from his peers, and which endeared him to legions of fans throughout the world. Over the decades, Como is reported to have sold millions of records, but he commonly suppressed these figures.

By the [[1980s]], the atmosphere of recording had changed dramatically from his early days at RCA Victor. Como's recording sessions had previously been filled with laughter and joy.  In his 1959 recording of "Santa Claus is Comin' to Town", listeners with headphones can hear him burst into laughter during one amusing orchestra passage. But in later years, the sessions deteriorated into much more sombre occasions. For this reason, he walked away from his final studio-produced recordings in the early 1980s. He returned to record a final album for RCA with his trusted friend and associate [[Nick Perito]] in [[1987]]. His recording of "The Wind Beneath My Wings'" was almost autobiographical, a fitting end to a long and successful recording career. Como would record only once more, in [[1994]], privately, for his well-known [[Christmas]] Concert in [[Ireland]].

Como received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2002. 

===Vocal characteristics===
Perry Como modelled his voice and style after [[Bing Crosby]] as most male singers of the [[1930s|1930's]] and [[1940s|1940's]] did. Perry Como's voice is widely known for its good-natured vocal acrobatics as portrayed in his highly popular novelty songs such as "Hot Diggity (Dog Ziggity Boom)". But there was another side to Perry Como aptly described by music critic Gene Lees in [[1968]]:{{Fact|date=March 2007}} 

{{quotation|Despite his immense popularity, Como is rarely given credit for what, once you stop and think of it, he so clearly is: one of the great singers and one of the great artists of our time. Perhaps the reason people rarely talk about his formidable attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art is the result of mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together to the point where you can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don’t even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so. I have of necessity given a good deal of thought and study to the art of singing, and Como’s work consistently astonishes me. He is a fantastic technician. Listen in this album to the perfection of his intonation, the beauty of the sound he produces, the constant comfortable breath control. And take notice of his high notes. Layman are often impressed by the high note you can hear for five blocks. Professionals know that it is far more difficult to hit a high note quietly. Como lights on a C or D at the top of a tune as softly as a bird on a branch, not even shaking it. And then there’s his phrasing. A number of our best singers phrase well. The usual technique is to rethink the lyrics of a song to see how they would come out if you were saying them, and then approximate in singing the normal speech inflections and rhythms. This often involves altering the melody, but it is a legitimate practice and when done well can be quite striking. But Como is beyond that. He apparently does not find it necessary to change the melodic line in order to infuse a song with emotion. A great jazz trumpeter once told me, "After fifteen years of playing, I’ve come to the conclusion that the hardest thing to do is to play melody, play it straight and get feeling into it." Como has been doing this from the beginning. Stylistically, he comes out of the Bing Crosby-[[Russ Colombo]] school. That was all a long time ago. Como has been his own man for many years now. He sounds like nobody else. And nobody sounds like him, either. He is hard to imitate precisely because his work is so free of tricks and gimmicks. There are no mannerisms for another singer to pick up from him. All one can do is try to sing as well and as honestly as Como, and any singer who does that will end up sounding like himself, not Como.}}{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

==Television==
Perry Como made the move to television when NBC televised the ''Chesterfield Supper Club'' radio program on December 24, 1948. In 1950, he moved to CBS and the show's title was changed to ''[[The Perry Como Show]]''. Como hosted this 15 minute musical variety series on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, immediately following the ''[[CBS Evening News|CBS Television News]]''. ''The Faye Emerson Show'' was broadcast in the same time slot on Tuesday and Thursday.

Como's 15 minute [[television program|television show]] continued through the early [[1950s|1950's]]. in 1955, ''The Perry Como Show'' was moved to Saturday night and expanded to an hour long. In 1959, Como moved to Wednesday night, hosting the ''[[Kraft Music Hall|Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall]]'' for the next five years. 

Como became the highest-paid performer in the history of television to that date, earning mention in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]''. Prior to this, Como competed with [[Jackie Gleason]] in what was billed the "Battle of the Giants", and won. This is now rarely mentioned, in part because Como commonly played down his own achievements.  

Como had numerous [[Christmas]] television specials, beginning on [[Christmas Eve]] [[1948]], and continuing to [[1994]], when his final Christmas special was recorded in [[Ireland]]. After his weekly TV series ended in [[1963]], Como's television specials became bi-monthly, then monthly, and were finally limited to seasonal specials celebrating [[Easter]], [[Spring (season)|Spring]], [[Thanksgiving]], and Christmas, ending in [[1987]]. They were recorded from many parts of the world, including the [[United Kingdom]], [[Rome]], [[Austria]], [[France]], and many locations throughout [[North America]].  Como's Christmas concert in Ireland was his final special, and the last of his commercial recordings.

==A farewell concert from Ireland==
In January 1994, Como travelled to [[Dublin]], Ireland, for what would be an auspicious moment in his long career of more than sixty years.  [[1993]] would have marked his fiftieth anniversary with the RCA Victor label as well as his forty-fifth year of television specials celebrating Christmas and its importance throughout the world to people of all faiths. Como's Irish Christmas was produced for the American [[PBS]] public television system and despite Como looking aged and unwell, has been re-broadcast annually since 1994. At the show's conclusion, Como apologized to his Dublin audience for a performance he felt was not up to his usual standards.

==Death==
Como died quietly in his sleep on [[May 12]] [[2001]] at his home in [[Jupiter Inlet Colony, Florida]], six days before his eighty-ninth birthday. He was reported to have suffered from symptoms of [[Alzheimer's disease]] throughout the final years of his life.{{fact|date=April 2007}}

==Trivia==
* Perry Como's birthplace of [[Canonsburg, Pennsylvania]] is also the birth place of popular singer [[Bobby Vinton]].  Vinton always claimed to be from Pittsburgh, while Como always said he was from Canonsburg, a suburb of Pittsburgh.

* The comedy show ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' featured a popular sketch with [[Eugene Levy]] as "Perry Como: Still Alive!" in which the singer was portrayed as so laid-back that he sang while lying down. The sketch became well enough known to have been mentioned in obituaries, which reported that Como had been greatly amused by it.

* Como's sugary Christmas track "Christmas Dream", complete with warm lyrics and charming German schoolchildren as the chorus, was used in the holocaust / Nazi-pursuit film ''[[The Odessa File (film)|The Odessa File]]'', forming a memorably ironic, bitter and satirical introduction to the film as [[Jon Voight]] drives through a modern brightly lit [[Hamburg]] at Christmas.

* Como was referenced in the series finale of ''[[Seinfeld]]'', in which [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]], [[George Costanza]], and [[Elaine Benes]]'s attorney [[Jackie Chiles]] tells Costanza: "I want the jury to see Perry Como!  No one's gonna convict Perry Como!"  Chiles wanted Costanza to look like a friendly man, and not a felon, in his court appearance.

* Como was also referenced on the [[animated]] show ''[[The Angry Beavers]]''. In the episode ''The Mom from U.N.C.L.E.'' Norbert and Daggett's mother says they look ''"strong and handsome, just like Perry Como."''.

* His version of ''[[Jingle Bells]]'' topped [[Billboard magazine]]'s [[Hot Ringtones]] chart in the [[December 16]], [[2006 in music|2006]] issue, meaning that Como has had chart-topping songs 61 years apart.

* In the ''[[Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[It's a Good Life (The Twilight Zone)|It's a Good Life]]," Dan Hollis receives a Perry Como album as a surprise birthday present. His inability to play the album at his leisure becomes the catalyst for his breakdown and tragic rebellion against little Anthony Fremont ([[Billy Mumy]]), who dislikes any singers' voices ("No singing while the music's playin'!").

* Como is mentioned in the third sketch of the 48th show of the second season of the [[Rocky and Bullwinkle]] Show (also featuring Wailing Whale episodes 5 & 6), which was first released on May 13, 1961.
