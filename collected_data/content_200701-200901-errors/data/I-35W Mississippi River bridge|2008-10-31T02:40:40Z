The '''I-35W Mississippi River bridge''' (officially known simply as '''Bridge 9340''') was an eight-lane steel [[truss arch bridge]] that carried [[Interstate 35W (Minnesota)|Interstate 35W]] across the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], United States. The bridge was completed in 1967, and its maintenance was performed by the [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]]. The bridge was Minnesota's fifth&ndash;busiest,<ref>{{cite web| title = 2006 Metro Area Traffic Volume Index Map| publisher =Mn/DOT|year=2006| url = http://www.dot.state.mn.us/traffic/data/maps/indexmaps/2006/metroindex.pdf| format =pdf| accessdate =2007-08-09}} Index map for Mn/DOT's 2006 traffic volumes; relevant maps showing the highest river bridge traffic volumes are Maps 2E, 3E, and 3F.</ref><ref name = week> {{cite web | last = Weeks | first = John A.

== Location and site history==
[[Image:I 35W Bridge.svg|320px|thumb|left|Bridge location in red]]
Located in Minneapolis, Minnesota's largest city, the bridge connected the Minneapolis neighborhoods of [[Downtown East, Minneapolis|Downtown East]] and [[Marcy-Holmes, Minneapolis|Marcy-Holmes]].  The south abutment was northeast of the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome|Metrodome]], and the north abutment was northwest of the [[University of Minnesota]] East Bank campus.  The bridge was the southeastern boundary of the "Mississippi Mile" downtown riverfront parkland.<ref>Flanagan, Barbara. (August 26, 1988) [[Star Tribune]] ''Sheba the donkey is off Nicollet Island, but on pictorial map of it.'' Section:News; page 3B.</ref>

Downstream is the [[10th Avenue Bridge]], once known as the Cedar Avenue Bridge.  Immediately upstream is the lock and dam at [[Saint Anthony Falls]], where Minneapolis began. The first bridge upstream is the [[List of historic civil engineering landmarks|historic]] [[Stone Arch Bridge (Minneapolis)|Stone Arch Bridge]], built for the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] and now used for bicycle and pedestrian traffic.<ref>{{cite web|title=History & Heritage of Civil Engineering|url=http://live.asce.org/hh/index.mxml?lid=158|publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers|date=|accessdate=2007-08-29}}</ref> 

The north foundation pier of the bridge was near a hydroelectric plant, razed in 1988.  The south abutment was in an area polluted by a [[Coal gas|coal-to-gas]] processing plant<ref name="burned">Meersman, Tom.

The bridge, officially designated '''Bridge 9340','' was designed by [[Sverdrup & Parcel]] to 1961 [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials|American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO, the precursor to AASHTO) standard specifications. The construction contracts, worth in total more than US$5.2 million at the time, went to Hurcon Inc. and Industrial Construction Company,<ref name=cp0809 /> which built the steel trusses and deck. Construction began in 1964 and the bridge opened to traffic in 1967.<ref name = "fatigue" /><ref name="factsheet" /> 

The bridge's fourteen spans extended 1,907&nbsp;feet (580&nbsp;m) long. The three main spans were of [[truss bridge|deck truss]] construction while all but two of the eleven approach spans were [[girder bridge|steel multi-girder]] construction, the two exceptions being [[concrete slab]] construction. The [[Deep foundation|piers]] were not built in the navigation channel; instead, the center span of the bridge consisted of a single 458-foot (140&nbsp;m) steel arched truss over the 390-foot (119&nbsp;m) channel. The two support piers for the main trusses, each with two load-bearing concrete pylons at either side of the center main span, were located on opposite banks of the river.<ref name="WCCO"> {{cite news | url=http://wcco.com/topstories/local_story_213191448.html| title=At Least 7 Dead in I35 Bridge Collapse|publisher=WCCO News|date=[[2007-08-01]]}}</ref><ref name="CJAD">{{cite news |url=http://www.cjad.com/news/56/565299 |title=U.S. officials urge quick inspections of bridges similar to Minneapolis span |date=[[2007-08-02]]}}</ref> The center span was connected to the north and south approaches by shorter spans formed by the same main trusses.

===Black ice===
In February and in December 1996, the bridge was identified as the single most treacherous cold-weather spot in the [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] freeway system, because of the almost frictionless thin layer of [[black ice]] which regularly forms as temperatures drop to 30s Fahrenheit (−1°C to 4°C) and below. The bridge's proximity to Saint Anthony Falls contributed significantly to the icing problem and the site was noted for frequent spinouts and collisions<ref>Blake, Laurie.

==Maintenance and inspection==
[[Image:I-35WBridgeOverhead.jpg|thumb|left|I-35W bridge (left) in 2006]]
Since 1993, the bridge was inspected annually by Mn/DOT, although no inspection report was completed in 2007, due to the construction work.<ref name=cp0809>{{cite journal|author=Anderson, G.R. Jr., Paul Demko, Kevin Hoffman, Jonathan Kaminsky, Matt Smith and Matt Snyder|title=Falling Down|work=City Pages|publisher=Village Voice Media volume=28|issue=1392|date=[[2007-08-09]]|url= http://citypages.com/databank/28/1392/article15743.asp|accessdate=2007-08-29}}</ref> In the years prior to the collapse, several reports cited problems with the bridge structure. In 1990, the federal government gave the I-35W bridge a rating of "structurally deficient," citing significant corrosion in its bearings. "Structurally deficient" is a classification term which does not in itself indicate a lack of safety. Approximately 75,000 other U.S. bridges had this classification in 2007.<ref name=cp0809 /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=3442381|title= Minn. bridge problems uncovered in 1990 |accessdate=2007-08-03 |author= Cohen, Sharon; Bakst, Brian (Associated Press) |date=[[2007-08-02]]|work=ABC News (abc.go.com)|publisher=The Walt Disney Company}}</ref>

According to a 2001 study by the civil engineering department of the [[University of Minnesota]], cracking had been previously discovered in the cross girders at the end of the approach spans. The main trusses connected to these cross girders and resistance to motion at the connection point bearings was leading to unanticipated out-of-plane distortion of the cross girders and subsequent stress cracking. The situation was addressed prior to the study by drilling the cracks to prevent further propagation and adding supports struts to the cross girder to prevent further distortion. The report also noted a concern about lack of redundancy in the main [[truss]] system, which meant the bridge had a greater risk of collapse in the event of any single structural failure. Although the report concluded that the bridge should not have any problems with [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue cracking]] in the foreseeable future, the bridge instrumentation by strain gages and continuous [[structural health monitoring]] had been suggested.<ref name="fatigue">[http://www.lrrb.org/pdf/200110.pdf Fatigue Evaluation of the Deck Truss of Bridge 9340], Minnesota Department of Transportation, Report #MN/RC-2001–10, March 2001, retrieved from Minnesota Local Road Research Board website</ref>

[[Image:I-35W Bridge - April, 2006.jpg|thumb|The bridge seen from below in 2006]]
In 2005, the bridge was again rated as "structurally deficient" and in possible need of replacement, according to the [[United States Department of Transportation|U.S. Department of Transportation's]] [[National Bridge Inventory]] database.<ref>[http://apnews.myway.com/article/20070802/D8QOTC180.html Associated Press], ''Hopes Dim in Minneapolis for Survivors,'' 2 August 2007, retrieved 2 August 2007</ref> Problems were noted in two subsequent inspection reports.<ref name='mndot061005'>{{cite web |url=http://www.dot.state.mn.us/hottopics/35w/bridge_inspection_06-10-05.pdf |title=Bridge Inspection Report 06–10–05|format=PDF}}</ref><ref name="mndot061506">{{cite web |url=http://www.dot.state.mn.us/i35wbridge/pdfs/bridge_inspection_report_06-15-06.pdf |title=Bridge Inspection Report 06–15–06|format=PDF}}</ref> The inspection carried out June 15, 2006 found problems of cracking and fatigue.<ref name="mndot061506"/> On August 2, 2007, Governor [[Tim Pawlenty|Pawlenty]] stated that the bridge was scheduled to be replaced in 2020.<ref>[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/08/interview_with_minn_gov_pawlen.html RealClearPolitics - Articles - Interview With Minn.

The I-35W bridge ranked near the bottom of federal inspection ratings nationwide. The scale used was a "sufficiency rating" which ranges from the highest score, 100, to the lowest score, zero. In 2005 the bridge was given a rating of 50, indicating that replacement may have been in order. Out of over 100,000 heavily used bridges, only about 4% scored below 50. On a separate measure, the I-35W bridge was rated "structurally deficient," but was deemed to have met "minimum tolerable limits to be left in place as it is."<ref name='mndot061005'/><ref name='mndot061506'/><ref>[[Bill Dedman]],{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20102713/ |title=I-35 bridge was rated among the nation's worst |publisher=MSNBC.com |date=[[2007-08-03]]- |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref>

In December 2006, a steel reinforcement project was planned for the bridge. However, the project was canceled in January 2007 in favor of periodic safety inspections, after it was revealed that drilling for the retrofitting would in fact weaken the bridge. In internal Mn/DOT documents, bridge officials talked about the possibility of the bridge collapsing and worried that it might have to be condemned.<ref name="Phone call">{{cite news | url=http://www.startribune.com/10204/story/1370130.html | title=Phone call put brakes on bridge repair |publisher=Star Tribune |date=[[2007-08-20]] |accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref>

Several involved vehicles caught fire, including a [[semi-truck]], whose driver's body was later pulled from the cab.

The families of the deceased, the survivors, and the first responders who were directly impacted by the bridge collapse—together estimated to be at least several hundred people—did not have United States disaster assistance for individuals. Sandy Vargas, president and CEO of the Minneapolis Foundation, one of seven foundations that form ''Minnesota Helps'', believes the ''Minnesota Helps Bridge Disaster Fund'' cannot cover the uninsured medical costs for the victims of the bridge collapse.

Pawlenty and his office, during the last week of November, announced a "$1 million plan" for the victims. State law has limits that may limit awards to below that amount. No legislative action was needed for this step.

By the end of October 2007, the demolition operation was substantially complete, enabling construction to begin on the new I-35W bridge on November 1, 2007.  Much of the bridge debris is being temporarily stored at the nearby [[Bohemian Flats]] as part of the ongoing investigation of the collapse.

<blockquote>
"Although the Board's investigation is still on-going and no determination of probable cause has been reached, interim findings in the investigation have revealed a safety issue that warrants attention," said NTSB Chairman Mark V. Rosenker. "During the wreckage recovery, investigators discovered that gusset plates at eight different joint locations in the main center span were fractured. The Board, with assistance from the FHWA, conducted a thorough review of the design of the bridge, with an emphasis on the design of the gusset plates. This review discovered that the original design process of the I-35W bridge led to a serious error in sizing some of the gusset plates in the main truss."<ref name = SB0802/>
</blockquote>

On March 17, 2008, the NTSB announced an update on the investigation.  The announcement gave updates in the areas of load capacity, design issues, computer analysis and modeling, digital image analysis, and analysis of the undersized and corroded gusset plates.  The investigation revealed that photos from a June 2003 inspection of the bridge showed gusset plate bowing.<ref>[http://www.ntsb.gov/Pressrel/2008/080317.html Press Advisory<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>http://www.startribune.com/local/16927626.html Old photos show flaws in steel of I-35W bridge] By TONY KENNEDY, Star Tribune, Last update: March 23, 2008 - 1:51 PM</ref><ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080323/ap_on_re_us/bridge_collapse_plates Pre-collapse photos show bends on bridge] ([[2008]]-[[03-23]])</ref>
