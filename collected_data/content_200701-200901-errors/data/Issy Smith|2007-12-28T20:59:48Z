'''Issy Smith''' [[Victoria Cross|VC]] (c. [[18 September]] [[1890]]&ndash;[[11 September]] [[1940]])<ref>Australian Dictionary of Biography. Other sources give different dates of birth and death ([http://www.dnw.co.uk/dnw/medals/FMPro?-db=dnwmedals&-format=vcdetail.htm&-lay=master&-sortfield=vc%20recipient&GalleryFlag=VC&-max=50&-recid=12614929&-find= Dix Noonan Webb]).</ref> was a British-Australian recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to eligible forces of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and [[United Kingdom]]. Smith, the first living Jewish recipient of the Victoria Cross, was also awarded the French [[Croix de Guerre]] (with palm) and Russian [[Cross of St. George]] (4th class).<ref>Lieutenant [[Frank Alexander de Pass]] was awarded a posthumous VC in November 1914. A private in the [[First Australian Imperial Force]], [[Leonard Keysor]], was decorated for his actions in August 1915.</ref>  

Born Ishroulch Shmeilowitz (and other renderings), to parents residing in Egypt, Smith travelled to Britain as a child stowaway and first volunteered to serve in the British Army in 1904. He emigrated to Australia after discharge, where he remained until mobilised as a reservist in 1914. As a corporal in the 1st Battalion, The Manchester Regiment, Smith was engaged in the [[Second Battle of Ypres]]. On [[26 April]] 1915, Smith, on his own initiative, recovered wounded soldiers while exposed to sustained fire and attended to them "with the greatest devotion to duty regardless of personal risk".<ref name="LG">{{LondonGazette|issue=29272|supp=yes|startpage=8374|date=20 August 1915|accessdate=2007-10-01}}</ref> His conduct secured a recommendation for the Victoria Cross, which was awarded to Smith in August 1915.<ref name="LG"/>

After his demobilisation, Smith returned to Australia with his wife and daughter. He became a prominent figure in [[Melbourne]]'s Jewish community, was appointed a [[Justice of the Peace]], and unsuccessfully stood as a candidate for the [[United Australia Party]] in the [[Australian federal election, 1931|1931 general election]].<ref name="Times 1931">''The Times'', 21 December 1931; pg. 10; Issue 46011; col A</ref>

==Early life==
Smith was born in [[Alexandria]], the son of French citizens Moses and Eva Shmeilowitz, who were of Polish origin.<ref name="ADB">Australian Dictionary of Biography. Accessed 27 July 2007.</ref> His father was employed by the French Consulate-General as a clerk. Aged 11, Smith embarked as a stowaway aboard a vessel proceeding to London. Undaunted by this unfamiliar environment, Smith attended Berner Street School, Commercial Street, and worked as a deliverer in the [[East End of London|East End]], then an impoverished [[ghetto]] where [[Yiddish]] was the predominant spoken language.<ref>Rubinstein, p 242</ref> Persecution and extreme deprivation had compelled millions of Eastern European Jews to migrate to Western Europe, the Americas, and elsewhere. By the time of Issy Smith's arrival, Jewish immigration to Britain had peaked and was further curtailed by the enactment of the [[Aliens Act 1905|Aliens Act]] in 1905.<ref>Alderman, pp 149â€“150</ref> 

He joined the British Army in 1904, becoming a private in the Manchester Regiment. The pseudonym Issy Smith was adopted in the process of enlisting at the behest of a recruiting sergeant. Smith completed his training, serving in [[South Africa]] and [[India]] with the 1st Battalion. He boxed competitively, winning the British Army's middleweight championship, and played [[soccer|football]]. While in India, Smith was present at the [[Delhi Durbar]] parade, in which the 1st Manchesters participated, and thus awarded the Delhi Durbar Medal.<ref name="ADB"/> 

Accepting his discharge in 1912, Smith emigrated to Australia after brief employment in London. He lived in the Melbourne suburb of [[Ascot Vale, Victoria|Ascot Vale]] while working for the city's gas company. Retained as a reservist, Smith was mobilised by the British Army after the commencement of hostilities in August 1914. Some sources state that Smith was present at the capture of [[German New Guinea]] by the [[Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force]].<ref name="DNW">[http://www.dnw.co.uk/dnw/medals/FMPro?-db=dnwmedals&-format=vcdetail.htm&-lay=master&-sortfield=vc%20recipient&GalleryFlag=VC&-max=50&-recid=12614929&-find= Dix Noonan Webb], dnw.co.uk.

==World War I==
[[Image:Victoria Cross Medal Ribbon & Bar.jpg|thumb|The Victoria Cross.]] 
The 1st Manchester Regiment, stationed in India, sailed from [[Karachi]] for France on [[29 August]] 1914 as the constituent British battalion of the Jullundur Brigade, 3rd ([[Lahore]]) Indian Division. The battalion disembarked at [[Marseilles]] in late September, but was not deployed to the front until [[26 October]] 1914, when it occupied trenches east of [[Festubert]].<ref name="James">James p 96</ref><ref>Mileham, p 85</ref>

Actively engaged in the battles of [[Battle of Givenchy|Givenchy]] and [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle|Neuve Chapelle]], the 1st Manchesters had incurred hundreds of casualties by the beginning of [[Second Battle of Ypres|"Second Ypres"]] on [[22 April]] 1915.<ref name="Mileham">Mileham, p 92</ref> [[Chemical warfare]] first emerged on the Western Front during the German offensive, and Smith himself would be temporarily incapacitated by gas. The 1st Manchesters were involved in an initially successful counter-attack conducted by the Jullundur and Ferozepore brigades on [[26 April]] 1915, near Wieltje, in conjunction with other  Allied units.<ref name="Wyrall">Wyrall, p 122</ref> Rudimentary forms of protection against the [[chlorine gas]] proved ineffectual, limiting the advance and causing many soldiers to succumb to its effects.<ref name="Mileham"/><ref name="Wyrall"/> 

During the Allied counter-attack, Smith, of his own volition, ventured towards a German position to attend to a severely wounded soldier. He carried him some {{convert|250|yd|m|-1}} to relative safety while exposed to intense German fire. According to the Victoria Cross citation, he brought in "many more wounded men" throughout the day under similarly perilous conditions "regardless of personal risk".<ref name="LG"/> Recounting his own rescue by Smith to a [[Daily Mail]] correspondent, Sergeant Rooke said of the corporal: "He behaved with wonderful coolness and presence of mind the whole time, and no man deserved a Victoria Cross more thoroughly than he did".<ref name="DNW"/>

Subsequently Corporal Smith displayed great gallantry, when the casualties were very heavy, in voluntarily assisting to bring in many more wounded men throughout the day, and attending to them with the greatest devotion to duty regardless of personal risk.

Smith was hospitalised in Dublin, where he recuperated from his gassing. His Victoria Cross was later presented to him at [[Buckingham Palace]] by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]].<ref>Jewish Chronicle, 11 February 1916, p 8</ref> Feted by publications such as the [[Jewish Chronicle]], Smith's status as a recipient of the VC was utilised by the British government for the purposes of stimulating further recruitment.<ref>Cesarani, p 118</ref><ref name="DNW"/> His visits to Jewish communities in the United Kingdom generated much interest, attracting dignitaries and large crowds in the process.<ref name="DNW"/> On one such occasion, in September 1915, he was invited back to his old school in the East End receive a gold watch and chain in honour of his Victoria Cross from his former schoolmates.<ref>''The Times'', 6 September 1915; pg. 11; Issue 40952; col D</ref> Also that month, Smith was received at [[Mansion House, Dublin]] by the [[Under-Secretary for Ireland]] [[Matthew Nathan]], who took advantage of the occasion to reaffirm loyalty to both Britain and Ireland.<ref>Keogh, p 69</ref> Contemporaries, however, continued to report instances of discrimination against Jewish servicemen, including an incident involving Issy Smith in Leeds.<ref>Jewish Chronicle, 22 October 1915, p 5</ref> While documenting his recruitment drive, the Jewish Chronicle reported that the proprietor of the Grand Restaurant had refused to serve Smith during his tour of [[Yorkshire]] because he was Jewish, while indicating the staff were prepared to accept his non-Jewish acquaintance.<ref>Jewish Chronicle, 22 October 1915, p 13</ref> Smith's tour continued without disruption, taking him to [[Edinburgh]], Scotland. 

Meanwhile, on the Western Front, the demoralised and depleted Indian Corps fought its final European battle at [[Battle of Loos|Loos]].<ref>Omissi, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/india_wwone_01.shtml India and the Western Front], bbc.co.uk. Accessed 15 August 2007.</ref> With the exception of two cavalry divisions, the Indian Corps in Europe redeployed to the Middle East theatre, sailing from Marseilles on [[10 December]], 1915 and arriving in [[Basra]] on [[8 January]] 1916 to be integrated into the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force.<ref name="James"/> Smith returned to active duty as a sergeant, serving in [[Mesopotamian Campaign|Mesopotamia]] and [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Palestine]] until the cessation of hostilities with the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Germany on [[30 October]] and [[11 November]] respectively. He had been wounded five times.<ref name="ADB"/>

Demobilised after the war, Smith returned to London. As a war hero, he was intermittently invited to social functions. In June 1920, he attended a garden party at [[Buckingham Palace]], given by the king for all surviving Victoria Cross recipients. They included veterans of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Mutiny]], [[Rorke's Drift]], [[Nile Expedition|Relief of General Gordon]], the [[First Boer War|First]] and [[Second Boer War]]s, countless campaigns on the borders of the empire, and dozens from [[World War I|Great War]].<ref>''The Times'', 28 June 1920; pg. 19; Issue 42448; col B</ref> In October 1921, with [[Henry Edward Kenny| Harry Kenny VC]], he unveiled the Hackney War Memorial.<ref>''The Times'', 15 September 1921; pg. 5; Issue 42826; col G</ref> In 1922, he attended "The Pilgrimage to Ypres", in Belgium, laying a wreath at the [[Cloth Hall, Ypres|Cloth Hall]] there.<ref>''The Times'', 31 July 1922; pg. 12; Issue 43097; col A</ref>

==Legacy==
Despite his fame and popularity, like many former servicemen contending with post-war economic hardship, Smith struggled financially &ndash; a predicament compounded by illness.<ref>Jewish Chronicle, 20 January 1922, p 9</ref> As a consequence he pawned his medals for [[pound sterling|Â£]]20, only for them to be recovered by the [[Jewish Historical Society of England|Jewish Historical Society]] on the urging of the wife of Chief Rabbi [[Joseph H. Hertz]] and ultimately reunited with Smith.<ref>Jewish Chronicle, 28 November 1924, p 13</ref><ref name="JC 95">Jewish Chronicle, 6 October 1995, p 6</ref> Smith's varied occupations in post-war Britain included work as an actor with a theatre troupe.<ref>Grimsby Evening Telegraph, 7 September 2006</ref> He emigrated to Australia in 1925 with his wife Elsie (neÃ© McKechnie), whom he had married at [[Camberwell]] Registry Office. Marriage to Elsie produced two children (Olive and Maurice) and reputedly angered his parents despite the couple's later observance of Jewish religious tradition in a formal ceremony held at Central [[Synagogue]], Hallam Street.<ref name="ADB"/>

The family settled in [[Moonee Ponds, Victoria|Moonee Ponds]], Melbourne, where Smith's standing in the Jewish community became high.<ref name="ADB"/> He was appointed manager of [[British International Pictures]] in Melbourne, in 1928, worked for [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop Rubber Company]], and was finally employed by the Civil Aviation Board at [[Essendon Airport]]. Appointed a [[Justice of the Peace]] in 1930, Smith tried politics as a candidate in the 1931 Federal elections for the [[United Australia Party]] contesting the seat of Melbourne in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], and "seriously challenged the hitherto unassailable Dr Maloney".<ref name="Times 1931"/>

Smith died of [[coronary thrombosis]] in September 1940.<ref name="ADB"/> He was buried in the Jewish section of Fawkner Cemetery with full military honours. His Victoria Cross was sold by his family in 1990 and later auctioned as part of a collection of Smith's medals, selling for approximately [[Pound sterling|Â£]]30,000 pounds ([[United States Dollar|$]]60,000).<ref name="DNW"/><ref name="JC 95"/>
