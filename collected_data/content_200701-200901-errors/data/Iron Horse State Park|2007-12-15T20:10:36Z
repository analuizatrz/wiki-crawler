'''Iron Horse State Park''', part of the [[Washington State Park System]], is a {{convert|1612|acre|sqkm|0|sing=on}} [[state park]] located in the [[Cascade Mountains]] and [[Yakima River]] Valley, between Cedar Falls on the west and the [[Columbia River]] on the east.

The park is a [[rail trail]] that crosses [[Snoqualmie Pass]].  The heritage park commemorating railroading was once in the [[right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] of the The Milwaukee Road, officially the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad]].  The right-of-way was acquired by the state after the railroad's bankruptcy in the 1980s and has been converted into {{convert|110|mi|km|0}} of [[hiking]], [[mountain biking]], and [[horseback riding]] trail.<ref>{{cite web

== Recreation ==
Like most [[rails-to-trails]] projects, Iron Horse is popular with hikers and cyclists.  There are many trail heads across the state, most with modern facilities, ample parking for a less common trail, and even a handful of campgrounds.<ref Name="WSDOT">{{cite web  | title = Washington State Tour Planning and Bicycling Maps  | work = Collection of maps and resources   | publisher = WSDOT  | date = 2006  | url = http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/bike/Planning_Maps.htm  | format = Web and PDF  | doi =  | accessdate = July 3, 2007 }}</ref>

The trail passes through mostly woodland, several lakes, hidden waterfalls like the one shown below, and goes directly through the divide at the old [[Snoqualmie Tunnel]].  The park is easily accessible from [[I-90]];  unfortunately it's within sight of the freeway in some places.

Iron Horse seems to be more popular for its scenery than its history, although it's less well-known than other parks like the [[Alpine Lakes Wilderness]] area (which Iron Horse passes through) or [[Snoqualmie Falls]].

The park trail continues through the Town of [[South Cle Elum, Washington|South Cle Elum]] where the preserved Milwaukee Road depot and substation, as well as the remains of the rail yard are located. The [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad: South Cle Elum Yard|depot, substation, and rail yard]] are listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. There is a small museum in the depot. In [[Kittitas, Washington|Kittitas]], the trail passes [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad-Kittitas Depot|The Milwaukee Road depot]] and the ruins of the substation. That depot is also listed in the National Register of Historic Places. In addition to these buildings, other infrastructure remains, such as tunnels and bridges.
