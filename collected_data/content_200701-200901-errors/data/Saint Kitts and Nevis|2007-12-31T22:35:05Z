The '''Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis''' (also known as the '''Federation of Saint Christopher and Nevis''' <ref>Both the names Saint Christopher and Saint Kitts are given in the [http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Kitts/kitts83.html Constitution of Saint Christopher and Nevis].</ref>), located in the [[Leeward Islands]], is a federal two-island nation in the [[West Indies]] It is the smallest nation in the Americas in both [[List of countries by area|area]] and [[List of countries by population|population]]. 

The capital city and headquarters of government for the federated state is on the larger island of [[Saint Kitts]]. Kit, or Kitt, is an old-fashioned abbreviation for the name Christopher. This island was given the name by Christopher Columbus; the Spanish version was "San Cristóbal".

The smaller state of [[Nevis]], formerly named "Nuestra Señora de las Nieves" (translated "[[Our Lady of the Snows]]"), lies about 2 miles (3 km) southeast of Saint Kitts, across a shallow channel called "The Narrows".  

Historically, the [[United Kingdom|British]] dependency of [[Anguilla]] was also a part of this union, then known collectively as [[Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla]]. 

Saint Kitts and Nevis are geographically part of the Leeward Islands. To the north-northwest lie the islands of [[Saint Eustatius]], [[Saba]], [[Saint Barthélemy]], and [[Saint Martin]]. To the northeast are [[Antigua and Barbuda]], and to the southeast is the small uninhabited island of [[Redonda]], and the island of [[Montserrat]], which currently has an active [[volcano]].

==History==
{{main|History of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}

The islands of Saint Kitts and Nevis are two of the Caribbean's oldest colonised territories. Saint Kitts became the first British colony in the West Indies in 1624 and then became the first French colony in the Caribbean in 1625, when both nations decided to partition the island.

Five thousand years prior to European arrival, the island was settled by Neo-Indian peoples. The latest arrivals, the [[Kalinago]] peoples, arrived approximately 3 centuries before the Europeans. The Kalinago allowed the Europeans to colonize Saint Kitts, while earlier attempts to settle other islands were met with immediate destruction of the colonies by the Indians. The Kalinago were eventually wiped out in the great [[Kalinago Genocide of 1626]]. 

The island of Nevis was colonized in 1628 by British settlers from Saint Kitts. From there, Saint Kitts became the premier base for British and French expansion, as the islands of [[Antigua]], [[Montserrat]], [[Anguilla]] and [[Tortola]] for the British, and [[Martinique]], the [[Guadeloupe]] archipelago and [[St. Barths]] for the French were colonized from it.

Although small in size, and separated by only {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} of water, the two islands were viewed and governed as different states until the late 19th century, when they were forcefully unified along with the island of Anguilla by the British. To this day relations are strained, with Nevis accusing Saint Kitts of neglecting its needs.

Saint Kitts and Nevis, along with [[Anguilla]], became an [[Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla|associated state]] with full internal autonomy in 1967. Angullians rebelled, and their island was allowed to separate from the others in 1971. St. Kitts and Nevis achieved independence in 1983. It is the newest sovereign nation in the Americas. In August 1998, a vote in Nevis on a referendum to separate from St. Kitts fell short of the two-thirds majority needed. In late September 1998, [[Hurricane Georges]] caused approximately $445 million in damages and limited [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth for the year.

[[Alexander Hamilton]], the first United States Secretary of the Treasury, was born in Nevis; he spent his childhood there and on [[St. Croix]], then belonging to [[Denmark]], and now one of the [[United States Virgin Islands]].

{{main|Politics of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}
[[Image:Flag of the OECS.svg|thumb|left|Saint Kitts and Nevis is a full member of the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]].]]The country is an independent [[Commonwealth Realm]] with Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] as its [[head of state]], represented in St. Kitts and Nevis by a [[List of Governors-General of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Governor-General]], who acts on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Prime Minister]] and the Cabinet. The prime minister is the leader of the majority party of the House, and the cabinet conducts affairs of state.

St. Kitts and Nevis has a [[unicameral]] legislature, known as the [[National Assembly of Saint Kitts and Nevis|National Assembly]]. It is composed of fourteen members: eleven elected Representatives (three from the island of [[Nevis]]) and three Senators who are appointed by the [[Governor-General of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Governor-General]]. Two of the senators are appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister, and one on the advice of the leader of the opposition. Unlike in other countries, senators do not constitute a separate [[Senate]] or [[upper house]] of parliament, but sit in the National Assembly, alongside representatives. All members serve five-year terms. The Prime Minister and the Cabinet are responsible to the Parliament.

Saint Kitts and Nevis is a full and participating member of the [[Caribbean Community|Caribbean Community (CARICOM)]] and the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS).

== Geography ==
[[Image:Sc-map.png|thumb|Map of Saint Kitts and Nevis]]
{{main|Geography of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}
{{seealso|List of cities in Saint Kitts and Nevis}}
The country has two main islands, [[Saint Kitts]] and [[Nevis]]. The highest peak, at 1,156 [[metre]]s, is [[Mount Liamuiga]].

The islands are of [[volcanic]] origin, with large central peaks covered in [[tropical rainforest]]; the steeper slopes leading to these peaks are mostly uninhabited. The majority of the population on both islands lives closer to the sea where the terrain flattens out. There are numerous [[rivers]] descending from the mountains of both islands, which provide fresh water to the local population.  St. Kitts also has one small [[lake]].

== Economy ==
[[Image:Stkitts-view-lookingatsea.jpg|right|thumb|200px|View of Nevis. Salt pond at right.]]
{{main|Economy of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}

Saint Kitts and Nevis is a twin-island federation whose economy is characterized by its dominant tourism, agriculture and light manufacturing industries. Sugar was the primary export from the 1640s on, but rising production costs, low world market prices, and the government's efforts to reduce dependence on it have led to a growing diversification of the agricultural sector. In 2005, the government decided to close down the state-owned sugar company, which had caused losses and was a significant contributor to the fiscal deficit. Former sugar plantations still dominate the St. Kitts landscape. The agricultural, tourism, export-oriented manufacturing, and offshore-banking sectors are being developed and are now taking larger roles in the country’s economy. The growth of the tourism sector has become the main foreign exchange earner for Saint Kitts and Nevis. The country has also developed a successful apparel assembly industry and one of the largest electronics assembly industries in the Caribbean.

During the 1990s, Saint Kitts and Nevis registered an annual GDP growth of 5.5 percent, but the strong growth was interrupted by devastating hurricanes in 1998 and 1999. Post-hurricane reconstruction led to an economic resumption in 2000 with GDP growing 6.2 percent. The year 2001 began well enough although the post-hurricane construction boom was over and growth was slowing from its 2000 rate. But after September 11, tourism arrivals dropped off precipitously and activity in related sectors of the economy such as road construction and retail sales declined along with tourism. As a result, the GDP growth declined substantially in 2001 and 2002. Economic activity has recovered since 2003, mainly driven by strong growth in tourism. In view of its high level of public debt, the country needs a prudent fiscal policy to ensure sustainable economic growth.
