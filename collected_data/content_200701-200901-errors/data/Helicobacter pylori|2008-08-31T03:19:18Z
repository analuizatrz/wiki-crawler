'''''Helicobacter pylori''''' ({{pronEng|ˌhɛl<s>ɪ</s>kəˈbæktɚ paɪˈlɔəraɪ}}) is a [[gram-negative]], [[microaerophile|microaerophilic]] [[bacterium]] that inhabits various areas of the stomach and [[duodenum]]. It causes a chronic low-level [[inflammation]] of the stomach lining and is strongly linked to the development of [[peptic ulcer]]s and stomach [[cancer bacteria|cancer]]. However, most who are infected do not show any symptoms of disease. 

The bacterium was initially named ''Campylobacter pyloridis'', then ''C. pylori'' (after a correction to the [[Latin grammar]]).  In 1989, after [[DNA sequencing]] and other data showed that the bacterium did not belong in the genus ''[[Campylobacter]]'', it was placed in its own [[genus]], ''[[Helicobacter]]''. The generic name derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''hělix''/έλιξ "spiral" or "coil".<ref name=Liddell1980>{{cite book

More people are infected with ''H. pylori'' than any other species of bacteria; 50% or more of the world's population harbour it. It is more prevalent in developing countries.

''H. pylori'' is a helix shaped [[Gram-negative]] bacterium, about 3&nbsp;micrometres long with a diameter of about 0.5&nbsp;micrometre.  It is [[microaerophilic]];  it requires [[oxygen]] although at lower concentration than is found in the [[earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. It contains a [[hydrogenase]] which can be used to obtain energy by oxidizing molecular [[hydrogen]] (H<sub>2</sub>) that is produced by intestinal bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Olson JW Maier RJ|title=Molecular hydrogen as an energy source for ''Helicobacter pylori''|journal=Science|volume=298|issue=5599|date=2002|month=November 29|pages=1788–1790|pmid= 12459589 }}</ref> It tests positive for [[oxidase test|oxidase]], [[catalase]], and [[urease]].

===Genome===
[[Image:Helicobacter pylori.jpg|thumb|EM photograph of ''H. pylori'']]

The two sequenced strains show large genetic differences, with up to 6% of the [[nucleotides]] differing.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

Study of the ''H. pylori'' genome is centered on attempts to understand [[pathogenesis]], the ability of this [[organism]] to cause disease. There are 62 genes in the "pathogenesis" category of the genome database. Both sequenced strains have an approximately 40&nbsp;[[Base pair#Length_measurements|kb]]-long Cag [[pathogenicity island]] (a common gene sequence believed responsible for pathogenesis) that contains over 40 genes. This pathogenicity island is usually absent from ''H. pylori'' strains isolated from humans who are carriers of ''H. pylori'' but remain [[asymptomatic]].{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

The ''cagA'' gene codes for one of the major ''H. pylori'' [[virulence]] proteins. Bacterial strains that have the ''cagA'' gene are associated with an ability to cause severe ulcers.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} The ''cagA'' gene codes for a relatively long (1186 [[amino acid]]) protein. The ''cag'' pathogenicity island (PAI) has about 30 genes part of which code for a complex [[Secretion#Type IV secretion system (T4SS)|type IV secretion system]]. The low GC content of the ''cag'' PAI relative to the rest of the helicobacter genome suggests that the island was acquired by horizontal transfer from another bacterial species.<ref name="Tomb 1997"/>

==Pathophysiology==
''H. pylori'' colonizes the stomach and induces chronic [[gastritis]], a long-lasting inflammation of the stomach. The bacterium persists in the stomach for decades in most people. However most infected people will never experience clinical symptoms despite having chronic gastritis. 10-20% of those colonized by ''H. pylori'' will ultimately develop [[peptic ulcers]].<ref name="pmid16847081">{{cite journal |author=Kusters JG, van Vliet AH, Kuipers EJ |title=Pathogenesis of ''Helicobacter pylori'' infection |journal=Clin. Microbiol.

[[Image:Helicobacter Pylori Urease.png|left|thumb|Molecular model of ''H. pylori'' urease enzyme]]
''H. pylori'' weakens the protective mucous coating of the stomach and duodenum by damaging the epithelial cells, allowing acid to damage and inflame the sensitive tissue beneath. Its helical shape allows the bacterium to move through the [[mucus]] lining easily.  Flagellar motility is essential for ''Helicobacter'' species to colonize the gastric mucus.<ref name="pmid11895962">{{cite journal

}}</ref> With its flagella, the bacterium moves through the stomach lumen and drills into the mucus gel layer of the stomach.  It then finds ways to live in various areas of the stomach. Many bacteria can be found deep in the mucus gel layer, which is continuously synthesized by stomach glands and epithelial cells and removed on the luminal side.  To avoid being carried into the lumen ''H. pylori'' senses the pH gradient within the mucus layer by [[chemotaxis]] and swims away from the acidic contents of the lumen towards the more neutral pH environment of the epithelial cell surface.<ref name="pmid15044704">{{cite journal |author=Schreiber S, Konradt M, Groll C, ''et al'' |title=The spatial orientation of ''Helicobacter pylori'' in the gastric mucus |journal=Proc.

Urease metabolizes [[urea]] (which is normally  secreted into the stomach) to [[carbon dioxide]] and [[ammonia]] (which neutralizes gastric acid). The survival of ''H. pylori'' in the acidic stomach is dependent on urease, and it would eventually die without the enzyme.  The ammonia that is produced is toxic to the epithelial cells, and, along with the other products of ''H. pylori''—including [[protease]], [[catalase]] and certain [[phospholipase]]s—damages those cells.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

Some [[Strain (biology)|strains]] of the bacterium have a particular mechanism for "injecting" the [[inflammation|inflammatory]] inducing agent [[peptidoglycan]] from their own [[cell wall]] into epithelial stomach cells. The injected peptidoglycan is recognized by the cytoplasmic [[pattern recognition receptor|immune sensor]] Nod1, which then stimulates expression of [[cytokines]] that promote [[inflammation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Viala J, Chaput C, Boneca IG, ''et al'' |title=Nod1 responds to peptidoglycan delivered by the ''Helicobacter pylori'' cag pathogenicity island |journal=Nat. Immunol. |volume=5 |issue=11 |pages=1166–74 |year=2004 |month=November |pmid=15489856 |doi=10.1038/ni1131 |url=}}</ref>

The CagA protein is transported into human cells where it may disrupt the normal functioning of the [[cytoskeleton]]. After attachment of ''H.pylori'' to stomach epithelial cells, the CagA protein is injected into the epithelial cells by the type IV secretion system. The CagA protein is [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] on [[Protein kinase#Tyrosine-specific protein kinases|tyrosine residues]] by a host cell membrane-associated [[tyrosine kinase]]. Pathogenic strains of ''H. pylori'' have been shown to activate the [[epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR), a membrane protein with a tyrosine kinase domain. Activation of the EGFR by ''H. pylori'' is associated with altered [[signal transduction]] and [[gene expression]] in host epithelial cells that may contribute to pathogenesis. It has also been suggested that a [[C-terminus|c-terminal]] region of the CagA protein (amino acids 873–1002) can regulate host cell gene transcription independent of protein tyrosine phosphorylation.  

Two related mechanisms by which ''H. pylori'' could promote [[cancer]] are under investigation. One mechanism involves the enhanced production of [[free radical]]s near ''H. pylori'' and an increased rate of host cell [[mutation]]. The other proposed mechanism has been called a "perigenetic pathway"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Tsuji S, Kawai N, Tsujii M, Kawano S, Hori M|title=Review article: inflammation-related promotion of gastrointestinal carcinogenesis - a perigenetic pathway|journal=Aliment Pharmacol Ther|year=2003|volume=18|issue=Suppl 1|pages=82–9|pmid=12925144|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2036.18.s1.22.x}}</ref> and involves enhancement of the transformed host cell phenotype by means of alterations in cell [[protein]]s such as [[cell adhesion|adhesion]] proteins. It has been proposed that ''H. pylori'' induces [[inflammation]] and locally high levels of [[TNF-alpha]] and/or [[interleukin 6]]. According to the proposed perigenetic mechanism, inflammation-associated signaling molecules such as TNF-alpha can alter gastric epithelial cell adhesion and lead to the dispersion and migration of mutated epithelial cells without the need for additional mutations in [[tumor suppressor gene]]s such as genes that code for cell adhesion proteins.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:pylorigastritis.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|''H. pylori'' colonized on the surface of regenerative epithelium (image from Warthin-Starry's silver stain)]]
Diagnosis of infection is usually made by checking for [[dyspepsia|dyspeptic]] symptoms and then doing tests which can indicate ''H. pylori'' infection.  One can test noninvasively for ''H. pylori'' infection with a [[blood]] [[antibody]] test, stool [[antigen]] [[stool test|test]], or with the [[Urea breath test|carbon urea breath test]] (in which the patient drinks [[carbon-14|<sup>14</sup>C]]- or [[carbon-13|<sup>13</sup>C]]-labelled [[urea]], which the bacterium metabolizes producing labelled [[carbon dioxide]] that can be detected in the breath). However, the most reliable method for detecting ''H. pylori'' infection is a [[biopsy]] check during [[endoscopy]] with a [[rapid urease test]], [[histological]] examination, and microbial culture.  None of the test methods is completely failsafe. Even biopsy is dependent on the location of the biopsy. Blood antibody tests, for example, range from 76% to 84% [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]]. Some drugs can affect ''H. pylori'' urease activity and give [[Type_I_and_type_II_errors#Type_II_error|false negatives]] with the urea-based tests.<ref name="Logan">{{cite journal |author=Logan RP, Walker MM |title=ABC of the upper gastrointestinal tract: Epidemiology and diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection |journal=BMJ |volume=323 |issue=7318 |pages=920–2 |year=2001 |month=October |pmid=11668141 |pmc=1121445 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Treatment==

Once ''H. pylori'' is detected in patients with a [[peptic ulcer]], the normal procedure is to eradicate it and allow the [[ulcer]] to heal. The standard first-line therapy is a one week ''triple therapy'' consisting of the antibiotics [[amoxicillin]] and [[clarithromycin]], and a [[proton pump inhibitor]] such as [[omeprazole]].<ref name=Mirbagheri_et_al_2006>{{cite journal | last = Mirbagheri | first = Seyed Amir | coauthors = Mehrdad Hasibi, Mehdi Abouzari, and Armin Rashidi | date = [[August 14]], [[2006]] | title = Triple, standard quadruple and [[ampicillin]]-[[sulbactam]]-based quadruple therapies for ''H. pylori'' eradication: A comparative three-armed randomized clinical trial | journal = World Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 12 | issue = 30 | pages = 4888–4891 | pmid = 16937475 | url = http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/12/4888.asp }}</ref>  The Sydney [[Gastroenterology|gastroenterologist]] [[Thomas Borody]] invented the first triple therapy in 1987.<ref name=Borody_1989>{{cite journal | last = Borody | first = Thomas J. | coauthors = | P.

It is widely believed that in the absence of treatment, ''H. pylori'' infection—once established in its gastric niche—persists for life.<ref name="Brown"/>  In the elderly, however, it is likely infection can disappear as the stomach's mucosa becomes increasingly atrophic and inhospitable to colonization.

==Prognosis==

As the incidence of gastric cancer has decreased, the incidences of [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] and [[esophageal cancer]] have increased dramatically. In 1996, [[Martin J.

Among some rod-like bacteria, he also found bacteria with a characteristic helix shape, which he called ''Vibrio rugula''. He was the first to suggest a possible role of this organism in the pathogenesis of gastric diseases. This work was included in the ''Handbook of Gastric Diseases'', but it had little impact as it was written in Polish.<ref>{{cite journal

The bacterium was rediscovered in 1979 by Australian pathologist [[Robin Warren]], who did further research on it with Australian physician [[Barry Marshall]] beginning in 1981; they isolated the organisms from mucosal material from human stomachs and were the first to successfully culture them. In their original paper, Warren and Marshall contended that most stomach ulcers and gastritis were caused by infection by this bacterium and not by [[stress (medicine)|stress]] or spicy food as had been assumed before.<ref>{{cite journal

Although there was some skepticism initially, within several years, numerous research groups verified the association of ''H. pylori'' with gastritis and to a lesser extent ulcers.<ref>{{cite web

He became ill several days later with nausea and vomiting. An [[endoscopy]] ten days after inoculation revealed signs of gastritis and the presence of ''H. pylori''. These results proved that ''H. pylori'' was the causative agent of gastritis. Marshall and Warren went on to show that antibiotics are effective in the treatment of many cases of gastritis. In 1994, the [[National Institutes of Health]] (USA) published an opinion stating that most recurrent gastric ulcers were caused by ''H. pylori'', and recommended that [[antibiotics]] be included in the treatment regimen.<ref>{{cite web

Recent research states that genetic diversity in ''H. pylori'' decreases with geographic distance from East Africa, the birthplace of modern humans. Using the genetic diversity data, the researchers have created simulations that indicate the bacteria seems to have spread from East Africa around 58,000 years ago. Their results indicate modern humans were already infected by ''H. pylori'' before their migrations out of Africa, remaining associated with human hosts since that time.<ref>{{cite journal
