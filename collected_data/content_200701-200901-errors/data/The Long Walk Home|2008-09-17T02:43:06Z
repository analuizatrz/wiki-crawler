'''''The Long Walk Home''''' was a [[1989 in film|1989]] film released in worldwide in [[1990 in film|1990]] starring [[Sissy Spacek]] and [[Whoopi Goldberg]].  

The film was set in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], [[Alabama]], [[United States]], during the [[1955]] [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]], and featured Goldberg as a young [[African-American]] maid, employed by a young white woman, played by Spacek.  When Goldberg's character decides to honor the bus boycott, opting to walk several miles to and from her employer's home, her employer decides to offer her a ride, thus thrusting both women into the politically charged situation. The film provides insight on the difficulty faced by black people during the boycott.  Goldberg's daughter accepts a bus ride and is assaulted by white males.  Spacek's husband in the show is lured into the anti-black movement by his brother. The movie is told through the eyes of Spacek's youngest daughter. Included in the film are many excerpts from [[MLK]]'s Speeches.

One of the three [[GM "old-look" transit bus|GM "old-look" transit buses]] used in this film was the actual Montgomery Bus Lines bus #2857 that [[Rosa Parks]] was riding in when she was famously arrested. The bus was in poor condition by the time the film was made. It was given a partial repaint and was towed by a cable for its scenes in the movie.

Addendum, notes from an extra in the movie: 

During the filming of the bus-stop scene, Sissy Spacek is slapped. The slap is real. They were not satisfied with several takes, so they decided to practice the scene without film to get it right. Spacek insisted on a real slap during the entire practice session, and all takes of the scene. They just applied make-up to cover her reddened face, and continued. I will always respect her as an actress for that. He really popped her, and she just kept taking it time and time again for the benefit of obtaining a realistic scene.

The bus stop scene was filmed from late afternoon until the wee hours of the morning, and was filmed every night for over a week to get that one scene. It was filmed at the actual location where Air Force wives picked up workers and took them to their jobs to assist the bus boycott.

I will never forget that week filled with racial slurs hurled loudly and openly, even though they were directed at a white woman (Spacek) it was so ugly and disgusting. I will also never forget that after one of our nightly midnight meals, several of us white men (all extras) went over and sat on the bench at the bus-stop. The bus-stop was constructed for the movie and can be seen briefly in a few swings of the camera. A few young black women came over (also extras) and sat with us, and one of them told us about some of the things that happened there during the boycott, and then we all sat together on the bench in silence. Words couldn't explain our feelings at that moment. 

Perhaps there were too many things to say at once, and the feelings were felt very deep. However painful acting out all these scenes must have been, the events depicted in this movie happened once but with the Grace of God, should never happen again.
