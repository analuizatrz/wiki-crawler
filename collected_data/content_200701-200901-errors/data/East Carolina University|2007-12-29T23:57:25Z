'''East Carolina University''' is a [[public education|public]], [[coeducational]], intensive [[research]] [[university]] located in [[Greenville, North Carolina|Greenville]], [[North Carolina]], [[United States]]. Named East Carolina University by statue and commonly known as '''ECU''' or '''East Carolina''', the university is the largest institution of higher learning in eastern North Carolina and the third-largest university in North Carolina. With an enrollment of 25,990 students, it is the fastest-growing campus in the [[University of North Carolina|UNC]] system.<ref>{{cite web| title = East Carolina University| work = Featured Campus Profiles| publisher = US Journal of Academics| date = June 2007| url = http://www.usjournal.com/en/students/campuses/ecu.html| accessdate = 2007-06-11 }}</ref> 

The [[North Carolina General Assembly]] founded ECU on [[March 8]], [[1907]] as a teacher training school and selected Greenville as its seat on July 2, 1908 with the first classes beginning in 1909.  While East Carolina has historical strengths in [[education]], [[nursing]], [[business]], [[music]], [[theater]], and [[medicine]], it offers over 100 [[Bachelor degree]] areas of study including [[mathematics]], [[Hospitality management studies|hospitality management]], [[engineering]], [[construction management]], [[computer science]], [[exercise physiology]], [[political science]], and [[social work]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Overview| work = East Carolina University | publisher = University of North Carolina System| date = 2007| url = http://www.unconline.net/site.php?id=2923| accessdate = 2007-06-11}}</ref>

East Carolina's name changed from East Carolina Teachers Training School (ECTTS) in 1907 to East Carolina Teachers College (ECTC), then East Carolina College (ECC), and finally, in 1967, to East Carolina University (ECU).<ref name="McLawhorn"/>  The change in its name reflects the changed mission.  Originally the school was established to train teachers for North Carolina, specifically the [[Eastern North Carolina|eastern part of the state]].  Today, ECU continues to serve eastern North Carolina in a larger capacity.  The [[Brody School of Medicine|medical school]] brings much needed medical care to the impoverished area.<ref>{{cite web| title = History: A Legacy of Commitment| work =About the School| publisher = The Brody School of Medicine| date = [[January 15]], [[2007]]| url = http://www.ecu.edu/cs-dhs/med/abtHistory.cfm| accessdate = 2007-07-16}}</ref>. In early August 2007, it was announced that the North Carolina General Assembly had approved and Governor Mike Easley had signed the budget including $25 Million for a new School of Dentistry at ECU with the first students expected no later than 2011. The Small Business Institute, through the [[College of Business at East Carolina University|College of Business]], offers assistance and advice to small business owners.<ref name="Small Business Institute"/>  East Carolina has grown from 43 acres in 1907 to almost {{convert|1400|acre|sqkm|0}} today.<ref>{{cite news| title = Greenville Gets the School| pages = 2 | publisher = The Daily Reflector | date = [[July 11]], [[1907]] | url = http://www.ecu.edu/cs-lib/archives/pr_display.cfm?id=563 | accessdate = 2007-07-14}}</ref>  The university today is located on four properties: main, hospital/health science, west research facility, and the Mattamuskeet field station.<ref>{{cite web| title = Facilities| work = Quick Facts| publisher = East Carolina University| date = [[April 4]], [[2007]]| url = http://www.ecu.edu/cs-admin/mktg/points-east-quick-facts.cfm| accessdate = 2007-07-06}}</ref><ref name="Mattamuskeet"/>  The seven undergraduate colleges, two undergraduate schools, graduate school, and one professional school are all located on these four properties.<ref>{{cite web| title = Brief Description| work = East Carolina University| publisher = The University of North Carolina - General Administration| date = [[June 30]], [[2006]]| url = http://intranet.northcarolina.edu/docs/assessment/Profiles/2006-07/Inst.Prof._2006ECU.pdf| accessdate = 2007-07-16}}</ref>  The majority of the non-allied health majors are located on the main campus.  The [[College of Nursing at East Carolina University|School of Nursing]], Brody School of Medicine, and some of the [[School of Allied Health Sciences at East Carolina University|Allied Health majors]] are located on the hospital/health science campus.  The students have an active social life.  There are nine [[Fraternities and sororities|social sororities]] and 16 [[Fraternities and sororities|social fraternities]].<ref name="Sorority"/><ref name="Fraternity"/> Also four historically black sororities, five historically black fraternities, one Native American fraternity, and one Native American sorority make up the Greek life.<ref name="NPHC"/>  Along with Greek life, there are over 300 registered clubs on campus.<ref name="Organizations"/>
