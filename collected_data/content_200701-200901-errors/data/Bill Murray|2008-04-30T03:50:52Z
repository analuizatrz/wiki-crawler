===Marriage and children===
During the filming of ''Stripes'', Murray wed Margaret "Mickey" Kelly on [[Super Bowl]] Sunday in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] on [[January 24]], [[1981]].<ref name= "chase"/><ref name= "white"/> They married again in Chicago in a church for their families.<ref name= "chase"/> They had two sons, Homer (born 1982) and Luke (born 1985), before divorcing in 1994.

Very detached from the [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] scene, Murray does not have an agent or manager and reportedly only fields offers for scripts and roles using a personal telephone number with a voice mailbox that he checks infrequently.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rodcorp.typepad.com/rodcorp/2005/02/how_we_work_bil.html|title=How we work: Bill Murray, actor|publisher =rodcorp|accessdate=2008-01-11}}</ref> This practice has the downside of sometimes preventing him from taking parts that he had auditioned for and was interested in, such as that of Sulley in ''[[Monsters, Inc]]'', Bernard Berkman in ''[[The Squid and the Whale]]'', Frank Ginsburg in ''[[Little Miss Sunshine]]'' and [[Willy Wonka]] in ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]].''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hotlist.uk.msn.com/actors_and_film/bill_murray_gets_lost_in_transportation.aspx|title=MSN Hotlist|publisher =Microsoft|accessdate=2008-01-11}}</ref>

==Career==
With an invitation from his older brother, [[Brian Doyle Murray|Brian]], Murray got his start at [[The Second City|Second City Chicago]] studying under [[Del Close]].<ref name= "chase"/> The [[improvisational comedy]] troupe was a perfect fit for Murray's clever, dry humor and [[ad lib]]bing.

===''Saturday Night Live''===
In 1975, an [[Off Broadway]] version of a ''Lampoon'' show led to his first television role as a cast member of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[variety show]] ''[[Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell]]'' that featured animal acts and little kids with loud voices.<ref name= "chase"/> That same season, another variety show titled ''[[Saturday Night Live|NBC's Saturday Night]]'' premiered. Cosell's show lasted just one season, cancelled in early 1976.

After working in [[Los Angeles]] with the "guerrilla video" commune [[TVTV]] on a number of projects, Murray rose to prominence in [[1976]]. He joined the cast of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' for the show's second season, following the departure of [[Chevy Chase]].

===Films===
Murray landed his first starring role with the film ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]'' in 1979. He followed this up with his portrayal of famed writer [[Hunter S. Thompson]] in 1980's ''[[Where the Buffalo Roam]]''. In the early [[1980s]], he starred in a string of box-office hits including ''[[Caddyshack]]'', ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'' and ''[[Tootsie]]''. 

Murray began work on a [[The Razor's Edge (1984 film)|film adaptation]] of the novel ''[[The Razor's Edge]]''. The film, which Murray also co-wrote,  was his first starring role in a [[dramatic film]]. He later agreed to star in ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' in a role originally written for [[John Belushi]]. This was a deal Murray made with [[Columbia Pictures]] in order to gain financing for his film.{{Fact|date=November 2007}} ''Ghostbusters'' became the highest-grossing film of 1984. But ''[[The Razor's Edge (1984 film)|The Razor's Edge]]'', which was filmed before ''Ghostbusters'' but not released until after, was a box-office flop. 

Upset over the failure of ''Razor's Edge'', Murray took four years off from acting to study philosophy and history at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], frequent the Cinematheque in Paris, and spend time with his family in their [[Hudson River Valley]] home.<ref name= "carr"/> During that time, his second son, Luke, was born.<ref name= "white"/> With the exception of a [[cameo appearance]] in the [[1986 in film|1986]] movie ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', he did not make any appearances in films, though he did participate in several public readings in [[Manhattan]] organized by playwright/director [[Timothy Mayer]] and in a production of [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''A Man's Man''.<ref name= "white"/>

Murray returned to films in 1988 with ''[[Scrooged]]'' and the sequel ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'' in 1989. In 1990, Murray made his first and only attempt at directing when he co-helmed ''[[Quick Change]]'' with producer [[Howard Franklin]]. His subsequent films ''[[What About Bob?]]'' (1991) and ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'' (1993) were box-office hits and critically acclaimed.

After a string of films that did not do well with audiences, he received much critical acclaim for [[Wes Anderson]]'s ''[[Rushmore (film)|Rushmore]]'' for which he won several awards. Murray then experienced a resurgence in his career as a dramatic actor. After dramatic roles in ''[[Wild Things]]'', ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'', ''[[Hamlet (2000 movie)|Hamlet]]'' (as [[Polonius]]), and ''[[The Royal Tenenbaums]]'', he garnered considerable acclaim for the [[2003 in film|2003]] film ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]''. He received a [[Golden Globe Award]] and a [[BAFTA]] award. He was also nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], in what was considered{{Who|date=November 2007}} to be a two-horse race between him and [[Sean Penn]] for Mystic River, who eventually prevailed. In an interview included on the ''Lost in Translation'' DVD, Murray states that this is his favorite movie in which he has appeared. 

<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:MurrayTable.jpg|thumb|200px|Bill Murray as Don Johnston in ''Broken Flowers''.{{deletable image-caption}}]] -->
During this time, Murray still appeared in comedic roles such as ''[[Charlie's Angels (film)|Charlie's Angels]]'' and ''[[Osmosis Jones]]''. In 2004, he provided the voice of [[Garfield]] in ''[[Garfield (film)|Garfield: The Movie]]'', again for [[Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties]] in 2006 (it should be noted that there's a common link between Murray and Lorenzo Music, the former voice of Garfield, and the voice of Dr. Peter Venkman in the TV series, [[The Real Ghostbusters]]).  and marked his third collaboration with Wes Anderson in ''[[The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou]]''. His dramatic role in [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s ''[[Broken Flowers]]'' was also well received.

In 2005, Murray announced that he would take a break from acting<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000195/bio|title=IMDb bio|publisher =IMDb|accessdate=2008-01-11}}</ref> , as he had not had the time since his new breakthrough in the late-[[1990s]]. He did return to the big screen, however, in a small role in Wes Anderson's ''[[The Darjeeling Limited]]''. 

Murray will also lend his voice for the upcoming game ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'', due out Fall 08.

===Golf-related work===
Murray is an avid golfer who often plays in celebrity tournaments.  His [[1999 in literature|1999]] book ''Cinderella Story: My Life in Golf'', part [[autobiography]] and part [[essay]], expounds on his love of golf. In 2002, he and his brothers starred in the [[Comedy Central]] series, ''[[The Sweet Spot]]'', which chronicled their adventures playing golf.

While at a golf tournament with British golfer [[Ian Poulter]] in [[St Andrews]], [[Scotland]], Murray was invited by a student of the university to a house party. Murray went with him and the student reported in Scottish papers that he acted just like he had in the karaoke scene of ''Lost in Translation'', being incredibly fun and energetic. Upon realizing that there were no clean glasses in the house for him to have a drink from, Murray volunteered to do the dishes and was said to be very amiable and unpretentious.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Movies/10/16/britain.billmurray.ap/index.html Bill Murray attends student party, does dishes (CNN)]</ref>

===Outside of show business===
He is a partner with his brothers in Murray Bros. Caddy Shack, a restaurant chain with locations near [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] and in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]] and [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]].<ref>[http://www.murraybroscaddyshack.com/ Murray Bros. Caddyshack Restaurant]</ref> 

He is a part-owner of the [[St. Paul Saints]] independent minor-league [[baseball]] team and occasionally travels to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] to watch the team's games.<ref>[http://www.saintsbaseball.com/staff/ownership/ St. Paul Saints ownership]</ref>  He also owns part of the [[Charleston RiverDogs]], [[Hudson Valley Renegades]], and the [[Brockton Rox]]. He invested in a number of other minor league teams in the past, including the [[Utica Blue Sox]], Fort Myers Miracle, and Salt Lake Trappers. He was also a part-owner of the Auburn Astros (now the [[Auburn Doubledays]]) in Auburn, NY.
