'''''Omphalotus nidiformis''''', or '''ghost fungus''', is a gilled [[basidiomycete]] [[mushroom]] found in southern Australia most notable for its [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] properties. Generally found growing on dead or dying trees, it is [[saprotroph]] and [[parasite]]. Its scientific name is derived from the [[Latin]] ''nidus'' "nest", hence 'nest shaped'. Similar in appearance to the [[oyster mushroom]], it was previously considered a member of the same genus, ''[[Pleurotus]]'',  and described under the former names ''Pleurotus nidiformis'' or ''Pleurotus  lampas''. However, it is [[poison]]ous and while not lethal, consuming this mushroom leads to severe [[cramp]]s and [[vomit]]ing. Poisonings have occurred over confusion with [[oyster mushrooms]]. It is one of several species with bioluminescent properties occurring worldwide, all of which are poisonous.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The ghost fungus was initially described in 1844 by English naturalist [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] as ''Agaricus nidiformis'', before being later placed in the genus ''[[Pleurotus]]'' in 1887. It was finally placed in the genus ''[[Omphalotus]]'' with other bioluminescent mushrooms by [[Orson K. Miller, Jr.]] in 1994.<ref>(1994) ''Mycol. helv.'' '''6'''(2): 93 </ref> Material had been collected by [[James Drummond (botanist)|James Drummond]] in 1841 from the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]] and described by Berkeley as both this and ''Agaricus lampas''. The latter name (as ''Pleurotus lampas'') persisted in some texts but has been synonymised with this species. Its specific epithet is derived from the [[Latin]] terms ''nīdus'' 'nest' and ''forma'' 'shape' or 'form', hence 'nest shaped'.<ref>{{cite book  | last = Simpson  | first = D.P.  | title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary  | publisher = Cassell Ltd.  | date = 1979   | edition = 5 | location = London  | pages = 883  | id = ISBN 0-304-52257-0}}</ref> ''Lampas'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''lampas''/λαμπας 'torch'.<ref name="Liddell 1980">{{cite book | author = [[Henry George Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] | year = 1980 | title = [[A Greek-English Lexicon]] (Abridged Edition) | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = United Kingdom | id = ISBN 0-19-910207-4}}</ref>

Several species with similar bioluminescent properties occur worldwide, all of which are poisonous. The best known are the North American jack o'lantern mushroom (''[[Omphalotus olearius]]'') and the '''Tsukiyotake''' (''[[Omphalotus japonicus]]'' (Kawam.) Kirchm. & O.K. Mill., aka ''Lampteromyces japonicus'' (Kawam.) Sing.) found in [[Japan]] and eastern [[Asia]]. A recent molecular study shows the ghost fungus to be most closely related to the western jack o'lantern mushroom, ''[[Omphalotus olivascens]]'', which is abundant in Southern and Central [[California]].<ref>Kirchmair M, Morandell S, Stolz D, Pöder R (2004) Phylogeny of the genus ''Omphalotus'' based on nuclear ribosomal DNA-sequences.

== Description ==
The fruiting body of the ghost fungus can be found on dead or diseased wood, where it causes white heart rot.<ref>{{cite book |title=Tree Diseases in Victoria|author=Marks GC, Fuhrer BA, Walters NEM|year=1982|publisher=Forests Commission|location=Victoria|isbn= }}</ref> A [[Saprotroph|saprobe]] or [[Parasitism|parasite]], it is nonspecific in its needs and can be found on native ''[[Banksia]]'', ''[[Hakea]]'' or ''[[Acacia]]'' and various [[Myrtaceae]] as well as introduced trees such as ''[[Pinus]]'' or ''[[Platanus]]'' species.<ref name="Bougher98">{{cite book |title=Fungi of Southern Australia|author=Bougher NL, Syme K |year=1998|pages=p210-11|publisher=[[University of Western Australia]] Press |location=Nedlands, WA |isbn=1-875560-80-7}}</ref>

The cap is very variable in colour, ranging from cream though often tinted with orange, brownish, greyish, purple or even bluish-black shades. Younger specimens are often darker. Growing up to 30 cm (15 in) in diameter it is funnel-shaped or fan-shaped in appearance with inrolled margins. The cream-white gills are decurrent and often drip with moisture. The stubby stem may be central to lateral in its attachment to the cap and is up to 8 cm (3 in) long and tapers to the base. The thin flesh is creamy white in colour. There is no distinctive smell or taste. The spore print is white.<ref name ="fungimap"/>

Its bioluminescence is best seen in low-light conditions when the [[eye]] develops [[night vision]]. The gills are the most luminescent part of the fungus, emitting a greenish light which fades with age. The light allegedly can be bright enough to read by.<ref name="Bougher98"/>

It may be confused with the brown oyster mushroom (''[[Pleurotus australis]]''), which is brown in colour and does not glow in the dark.<ref name ="fungimap"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
It occurs in south western [[Western Australia]], where it was first recorded by Drummond,<ref name="Bougher98"/> and south eastern Australia, from eastern [[South Australia]] through to southeast [[Queensland]]. It also occurs in [[Tasmania]].<ref name ="fungimap">{{cite book |title=Fungi Down Under:the Fungimap Guide to Australian Fungi|author=Grey P|year=2005|pages=p53|publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens |location=Melbourne |isbn=0-646-44674-6}}</ref> It can be found in eucalypt and pine forests,<ref>{{cite book |title=A Field Guide to Australian Fungi |author=Fuhrer B|year=2005|pages=p182|publisher=Bloomings Books|location=Melbourne|isbn=1-876473-51-7}}</ref> as well as in urban parks and gardens. Fruiting bodies can be numerous and occur in overlapping clusters on dead wood.<ref name ="fungimap"/>

==Biochemistry==
''Omphalotus nidiformis'' is not edible. Though reputedly mild tasting, eating it will result in vomiting.<ref name="Bougher98"/> Symptoms generally occur 30 minutes to two hours after consumption and last for several hours. There is no diarrhea and patients recover without lasting ill-effects.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Southcott RV|year=1974|title=Notes on some poisonings and other clinical effects following ingestion of Australian fungi |journal=South Australian Clinics |volume=6|pages=442-78 |id= }}</ref> The toxic ingredient is thought to be a [[sesquiterpene]] compound known as [[illudin]], which is also responsible for its bioluminescence.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Burgess ML, Barrow KD |year=1999|title=Biosynthesis of illudosin, a fomannosane-type sesquiterpene, by the Basidiomycete ''Omphalotus nidiformis''|journal=J.
