'''''Majulah Singapura''''' is the [[national anthem]] of [[Singapore]]. Composed by [[Zubir Said]], the song was selected in 1959 as the island's anthem. Upon full independence from [[Malaysia]] in 1965, ''Majulah Singapura'' was formally adopted as the national anthem. Originally written in [[Malay language|Malay]], the title means ''Onward Singapore.'' In 2001, the [[key (music)|key]] was officially lowered from [[G major]] to [[F major]] to allow a "grander expression".

== History ==
The composing of ''Majulah Singapura'' occurred during a push for independence from the [[United Kingdom]]. Started in 1956, [[Encik Zubir Said]] took a year to finish composing the music and lyrics for the song. The completed composition was performed for the first time on [[6 September]], [[1958]], when the [[Victoria Theatre]] was being reopened. The original intent of the song, according to Zubir Said, was to be for the City Council. Upon the dissolution of the Council, the popular song was chosen by Deputy Prime Minister [[Toh Chin Chye]] to become the national anthem. The [[Legislative Assembly of Singapore|Legislative Assembly]] agreed and chose ''Majulah Singapura'' to become the national anthem on [[November 11]], [[1959]]. On December 3rd of the same year, ''Majulah Singapura'' was formally introduced to the public as the national anthem.<ref name="infopediasg">{{Cite web|url=http://infopedia.nlb.gov.sg/articles/SIP_815_2004-12-23.html|title=The Singapore National Anthem|accessdate=2007-11-11|publisher=National Library Board Singapore|year=2002|author=Bonny Tan}}</ref> At the same time, the [[Flag of Singapore|national flag]] and the [[Coat of arms of Singapore|state crest]] was introduced. The timing of the adoption was centered around the inauguration of the [[Yang di-Pertuan Negara]], the Singapore head of state. The song was officially adopted as the national anthem in 1965, when Singapore achieved full independence after separating from Malaysia.<ref name="anthem">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhb.gov.sg/PE/resources/national_symbols/national_anthem.html|title=The National Anthem|accessdate=2007-10-27|publisher=National Heritage Board|author=National Heritage Board}}</ref> Originally written in the [[G major]] key, the anthem was officially relaunched using the [[F major]] key on [[19 January]] [[2001]]. The key was lowered so the anthem can be given a "grander expression" when being performed. The option for singing the anthem in the F major key was presented to local schools in 1983, along with other materials denoting how the anthem was being performed incorrectly.<ref name="infopediasg"/>
