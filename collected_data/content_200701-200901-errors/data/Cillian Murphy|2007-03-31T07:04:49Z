'''Cillian Murphy''' ([[Irish Language|Irish]]: Cillian Ó Murchú, [[May 25]], [[1976]]) is an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[actor]] known for his distinctively blue eyes[http://movies.about.com/b/a/193285.htm] and intense performances. ''Cillian'' is an Irish name which is [[anglicised]] ''Killian''; both spellings are [[IPA chart for English|pronounced]] "Killyann" (though the former spelling is often mispronounced "Sillian"). He is best known for his roles as Jim in ''[[28 Days Later]]'', [[Scarecrow (comics)|The Scarecrow]] in ''[[Batman Begins]]'' and Jackson Rippner in ''[[Red Eye (film)|Red Eye]]''. His most lauded performance was as Patrick "Kitten" Braden in ''[[Breakfast on Pluto]]'', for which he received his first [[IFTA Award]] and first [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination.
==Early life==
Murphy was born in [[Douglas, Cork]] in [[Ireland]]. He attended the [[Presentation Brothers College, Cork]], and later studied [[law]] at  [[University College Cork]] (UCC). 
Initially his interest in performing was led by music. He played guitar with a [[Frank Zappa]] influenced band called ''Sons of Mr. Greengenes''. However, by the time he left college his primary interest was acting. 
His first major role was in the UCC Drama Society production of ''[[Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme]]''. He went on to appear on the professional stage in ''[[Disco Pigs]]'', directed by Pat Kiernan and written by Enda Walsh. 

After touring with ''Disco Pigs'' in [[London]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[Cork (city)|Cork]], he left UCC without graduating.

==Career==
[[Image:Cillian1.jpg|110px|right|thumb|Cillian Murphy as Jim from ''[[28 Days Later]]''.]]''Disco Pigs'' was Murphy's first big break. He was cast in the central role of Pig in Corcadorca's 1996 production of Enda Walsh's original play. He later reprised that role for the [[2001 in film|2001]] independent film version by [[Kirsten Sheridan]], also writing and singing the song "So New" for the soundtrack. 

From 1997 to 2002, Murphy starred in feature films, [[Short film|shorts]], plays and in the BBC mini-series adaptation of ''[[The Way We Live Now]]'', but it was not until [[Danny Boyle]]'s ''[[28 Days Later]]'' became a [[sleeper hit]] in the [[United States of America|USA]] in [[2003 in film|2003]], that the major movie studios and directors started to take notice. As for the actor's full-frontal nudity in the film, Murphy claimed he was perfectly comfortable doing nudity if the role called for it.

In 2003, he starred alongside [[Colin Farrell]] in the Irish [[Independent film|indie]] ''[[Intermission (film)|Intermission]]'' and had supporting roles in his first Hollywood films, ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring (film)|Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' and ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]''. [[2005 in film|2005]] was the year that brought Murphy to wider recognition with his performance as Dr. Jonathan Crane/[[supervillain]] [[Scarecrow (comics)|The Scarecrow]] in ''[[Batman Begins]]'' and his role as bad guy Jackson Rippner in ''[[Red Eye (film)|Red Eye]]''. Murphy received a nomination for the Best Villain honor at the  [[MTV Movie Awards 2006|2006 MTV Movie Awards]] for his performance in ''Batman Begins'', but lost to [[Hayden Christensen]] for ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]''.

He originally auditioned for the role of [[Batman]] (Bruce Wayne) in ''Batman Begins''. Though the part was eventually given to [[Christian Bale]], director [[Christopher Nolan]] was reportedly very impressed with Murphy's audition and persuaded him to take the role of Crane. It is not known if the character of Dr. Crane will appear in the upcoming sequel, though Murphy has stated that he would be glad to reprise the character if asked.

According to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine, he was #3 of "The Most Valuable Players of Summer 2005", a list for entertainers who have outstanding breakthrough performances for the year 2005. He was placed behind [[Terrence Howard]] and [[Matt Dillon]]. The magazine went on to compare him with [[Robert Mitchum]].

In late 2005, he starred as a transgendered orphan in search of his mother in [[Neil Jordan]]'s ''[[Breakfast on Pluto (film)|Breakfast on Pluto]]'', based on the novel of the same title by [[Patrick McCabe]]. He was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Actor in Musical or Comedy for this movie ([[Joaquin Phoenix]] won for ''[[Walk the Line]]''), but won the 2006 [[IFTA Award]].

In [[2006 in film|2006]] / [[2007 in film|2007]], he starred in [[Ken Loach]]'s film about the [[Irish War of Independence]] and [[Irish Civil War|Civil War]], ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley (film)|The Wind That Shakes the Barley]]'', another movie in which his performance was highly praised. The film won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]], and replaced ''[[Intermission (film)|Intermission]]'' as the most successful independent film in Irish history.

Murphy recently finished playing the lead role in [[John Kolvenbach]]'s play ''Love Song'', opposite [[Neve Campbell]], in London's West End. In [[2007 in film|2007]], he stars as a physicist-astronaut charged with re-igniting the sun in the [[sci-fi]] movie ''[[Sunshine (2007 film)|Sunshine]]'', which re-teams him with director [[Danny Boyle]]. He will also be seen in the forth-coming romantic comedy, ''[[Watching the Detectives]]'', opposite [[Lucy Liu]].

Murphy just signed on to start filming ''[[The Best Time of Our Lives]]'' with [[Keira Knightley]], [[Lindsay Lohan]] and [[Matthew Rhys]] in Wales in May 2007.

==Personal life== 
Murphy is known for being intensely private about his personal life. He  married his long term girlfriend, artist Yvonne McGuinness (b. 1972), in August 2004 in [[Provence]], [[France]]. The couple live in [[London]], [[England]], with their son Malachy  (b. December 4, 2005).
