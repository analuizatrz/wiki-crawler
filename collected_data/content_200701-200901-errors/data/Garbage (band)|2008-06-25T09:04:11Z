Garbage released a string of increasingly successful [[single (music)|singles]] in [[1995]]–[[1996]], including "[[Stupid Girl (Garbage song)|Stupid Girl]]". Their debut album, ''[[Garbage (album)|Garbage]]'', was an [[Sleeper hit|unexpected smash]], selling over 4 million copies and certified [[music recording sales certification|double platinum]] in the [[UK]], [[USA]] and [[Australia]]. Garbage won the Breakthrough Artist award at the 1996 [[MTV Europe Music Awards]].<ref name="Version2.0PR">{{cite press release

Garbage spent two years working on follow-up album, ''[[Version 2.0]]'', which topped the [[UK Albums Chart|charts in the UK]] upon its [[1998]] release and the following year was nominated for two [[Grammy Award]]s, [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]].

==Formation (1993-1994)==
Erikson and Vig had been in numerous bands, including Spooner and Fire Town (with Marker as a [[sound engineer]]). In 1983, Vig and Marker founded [[Smart Studios]] in Madison and Vig's production work brought him to the attention of [[Sub Pop]].<ref name="recordcollector">"''[[Record Collector]]'' #209". Retrieved [[2008]]-[[02-24]]</ref> A short-term reformation and album from Spooner inspired Erikson, Marker and Vig to form a band: tired of using their own work for remixes, they decided to keep the material for their own project. An early comment that their work sounded "like garbage" inspired the band's name.<ref name="behindthemusic"/> 

Manson had been performing with the [[Edinburgh]] rock band [[Goodbye Mr. Mackenzie]] since 1984.<ref>{{cite album-notes | bandname=Goodbye Mr. Mackenzie | year=2005 | title=Hammer And Tongs}}</ref> Their album ''[[Angelfish (album)|Angelfish]]'' did not do any better than the preceding albums, selling only 10,000 copies.<ref name="Shirleycontract">153 F.Supp.2d 462 RADIOACTIVE, J.V., Plaintiff, v.

Initial sessions with Vig on vocals, and the member's past work with all-male groups led to the band's desire for a woman on lead.<ref name="volume">{{cite web | url=http://web.archive.org/web/19991014042851/www.cafemomo.com/inprint/9411volume.shtml | title=''Volume'' Issue 11/01/94 | publisher=Cafemomo.com | accessdate=2008-02-24}}</ref> Marker was watching ''[[120 Minutes]]'' when he saw the music video for Angelfish's "Suffocate Me". He showed the video to Erikson and Vig while their manager Shannon O'Shea tracked Manson down.

The audition did not go well, but Manson socialized with the men while there and they found they had a similar taste in music. Angelfish disbanded at the end of the Live tour.  Manson called O'Shea and asked to audition again feeling that "it would work out".<ref name="behindthemusic"/>

Manson began to work on the then-skeletal "Stupid Girl", "[[Queer (Garbage song)|Queer]]" and "[[Vow (Garbage song)|Vow]]" (ad-libbing the line "''I can't use what I can't abuse''").<ref name="makingmusic">"''Making Music'' [[June 1]], [[1996]] issue".

==''Version 2.0'' (1997-2000)==
Garbage relocated to [[Friday Harbor]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] on [[March 1]], [[1997]] to write songs for their second album. Returning to Smart Studios a short while later, the band found themselves under intense pressure to repeat the success of ''Garbage''. The band decided not to change their formula, but progress musically by pushing their sound as far as it could go - hence the album's eventual title ''[[Version 2.0]]'', which was completed by [[February 15]], 1998. In March, the first single "Push It" became the #1 most added record at the U.K. Alternative Radio.<ref name="Fastfacts">{{cite web | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20000408170127/http://garbage.com/ | title=Garbage Fast Facts | publisher=Garbage.com | accessdate=2008-02-24}}</ref> It became their third consecutive U.K. top ten hit at #9.<ref name="BGPromo"/><ref name="ussingles">{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.vnuArtistId=138644&model.vnuAlbumId=670290 | title=Single Chart History: Garbage | publisher=Billboard.com | accessdate=2008-02-24}}</ref>

==''Beautiful Garbage'' (2001-2002)==
Garbage regrouped on [[April 10]], [[2001]].  The group began work on their third record, and put aside plans for a [[B-sides]] album due to the sale of Almo Sounds to the [[Universal Music Group|UMG]]. Manson ran an online blog throughout the recording of the album named ''[[Beautiful Garbage]]''. During the recording of the album, Garbage invoked a provision of its contract to leave Almo, and sued UMG when it refused to terminate the contract. UMG threatened to use Manson's 1993 solo contract to tie Garbage to the label. The suit was settled on [[July 29]], 2001, and Garbage moved to [[Interscope]]. Lead single "Androgyny" was released to radio by the end of August, and its video was released on [[September 10]].<ref name="BGInterscopePOSbrochure">{{cite manual
