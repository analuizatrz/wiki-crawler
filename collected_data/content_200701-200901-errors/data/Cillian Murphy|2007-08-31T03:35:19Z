'''Cillian<ref name="Cillian">Pronounced "Killyann" (though often mispronounced "Sillian").</ref> Murphy''' (born [[25 May]], [[1976]]) is an [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[film]] and [[theatre]] [[actor]] active since 1996. He is noted for chameleonic performances in diverse roles,<ref name="Back Stage 2005">Riley, Jenelle.

A native of [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Murphy began his performing career as a [[rock musician]]. After a near miss with the music industry, he made his professional acting debut in the play ''[[Disco Pigs]]''. He went on to star in a number of Irish and [[United Kingdom|British]] film and stage productions throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, first coming to international attention in 2003 as the [[hero]] in the [[post-apocalyptic]] film ''[[28 Days Later]]''. But Murphy's best known roles are as [[Villain|villains]] in two 2005 [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]]: the [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]] in ''[[Batman Begins]]'', and Jackson Rippner in the [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] ''[[Red Eye (film)|Red Eye]]''. Next came two contrasting, widely acclaimed starring roles: his [[Golden Globe Award]]-nominated performance as [[transgendered]] outcast "Kitten" in 2005's ''[[Breakfast on Pluto (film)|Breakfast on Pluto]]'' and a heroic turn as a 1920s Irish [[revolutionary]] in 2006 [[Palme d'Or]] winner ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley (film)|The Wind That Shakes the Barley]]''. 2007 saw Murphy on the [[London]] stage in ''Love Song'' and onscreen in [[sci-fi]] film ''[[Sunshine (2007 film)|Sunshine]]''.

A resident of London since 2001, Murphy often works in or near London<ref name="Cillian Murphy IMDb Page">[http://imdb.com/name/nm0614165/ Cillian Murphy - Filmography], IMDb.</ref> and has no desire to move to [[Hollywood]]. Uncomfortable on the celebrity circuit, Murphy customarily gives interviews about his work, but he does not appear on television [[talk show]]s or discuss details of his private life with the press.

Accessed [[24 July]] [[2007]].</ref> Music also ran in the family, and Murphy started playing music at about age ten.<ref name="RTE Guide 2004">O'Donoghue, Donal. "Western Hero", ''RTÉ Guide'', [[6 February]] [[2004]].</ref>

Murphy attended the Catholic school [[Presentation Brothers College, Cork]], where he did well academically, though he was not keen on sport, a major part of life at PBC.<ref name="Independent action hero" /> But it was there that Murphy got his first taste of performing, when at 16, he participated in a drama module presented by Pat Kiernan, the director of the [[Corcadorca Theatre Company]]. Murphy later described the experience as a "huge high" and a "fully alive" feeling that he set out to chase,<ref name="From Cork to Gotham">Jackson, Joe. "From Cork to Gotham", ''Sunday Independent Life Magazine'', [[8 February]] [[2004]].</ref> but said that at this stage, performing meant dreams of becoming a rock star.<ref name="RTE Guide 2004" />

===From music to acting===
Originally, Murphy worked toward a career as a rock musician, playing guitar in several bands alongside his brother in his late teens and early twenties.<ref name="RTE Guide 2004" /><ref name="TONY 2005">Kaufman, Anthony. [http://www.timeout.com/newyork/article/7462/blue-streak "Blue Streak"], ''Time Out New York'', [[10 November]] [[2005]]. Accessed [[19 July]] [[2007]].</ref> The [[Beatles]]-obsessed brothers named their most successful band The Sons of Mr. Greengenes, after a [[Hot Rats|1969 song]] by another idol, [[Frank Zappa]]. Murphy sang and played guitar. He has said the band "specialised in wacky lyrics and endless guitar solos."<ref name="Observer O'Hagan">O'Hagan, Sean. [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1794559,00.html "&#39;I just want to challenge myself with each role&#39;"], ''The Observer'', [[11 June]] [[2006]]. Accessed [[8 August]] [[2007]].</ref> In 1996,<ref name="From Cork to Gotham" /> The Sons of Mr. Greengenes were offered a five-album record deal by [[Acid Jazz Records]].<ref name="Observer O'Hagan" /> They did not sign the contract, partly because Pádraig was still in secondary school, so their parents did not approve, and partly because the contract offered little money and would have ceded the rights to Murphy's compositions to the record label.<ref name="From Cork to Gotham" />

By then, Murphy was studying [[law]] at [[University College Cork]] (UCC), but flunked his first year exams because his heart was not in it.<ref name="From Cork to Gotham" /> Not only was he busy with his band,<ref name="RTE Guide 2004" /> but he had known within days after starting at UCC that law was the wrong fit for his artistic personality.<ref name="Electric Mail" /> Also, after seeing Corcadorca's stage production of ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]'' (directed by Pat Kiernan), acting had begun to pique his interest.<ref name="From Cork to Gotham" /> His first major role was in the UCC Drama Society production of ''[[Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme]]'', but, according to Murphy, his primary motivation then was to party and meet women rather than to start an acting career.<ref name="RTE Guide 2004" /> Nonetheless, with this role, he began to transition from music to acting, about which he later remarked, "I think there's such a thing as a performance gene. If it's in your DNA it needs to come out. For me it originally came out through music, then segued into acting and came out through there. I always needed to get up and perform."<ref name="Independent action hero" />

===Acting career===
====Early work====
The untrained new actor hounded Pat Kiernan until he got an audition at Corcadorca,<ref name="From Cork to Gotham" /> and in September 1996, he made his professional acting debut on the stage,<ref name="RTE interview">Guerin, Harry.

In late 2003, Murphy starred as a lovelorn, hapless supermarket stocker who plots a bank heist with [[Colin Farrell]] in ''[[Intermission (film)|Intermission]]'', which became the highest-grossing Irish [[independent film]] in Irish box office history (until ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley (film)|The Wind That Shakes the Barley]]'' broke the record in 2006).<ref name="RTE press watch">[http://www.rte.ie/business/2006/0808/presswatch.html "Loach Film Sets New Money Mark"], RTE.ie, [[8 August]] [[2006]].

====Critical success====
[[Image:RedEye05.jpg|left|thumb|240px|Murphy as Jackson Rippner in ''[[Red Eye (film)|Red Eye]]'', with [[Rachel McAdams]]]]

2005 was the year that Murphy won wider recognition for two high-profile villain roles, as Dr. Jonathan Crane/[[supervillain]] [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]] in ''[[Batman Begins]]'', and  as Jackson Rippner in the thriller ''[[Red Eye (film)|Red Eye]]''. He originally auditioned for the role of [[Batman]] in ''Batman Begins''. Though the part was given to [[Christian Bale]], director [[Christopher Nolan]] was reportedly very impressed with Murphy's audition and persuaded him to take the role of Dr. Jonathan Crane, whose alter ego is the villain [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]].

In late 2005 (early 2006 in Europe), Murphy starred as Patrick "Kitten" Braden, a [[transgendered]] Irish orphan in search of his mother, in [[Neil Jordan]]'s [[dramedy]] ''[[Breakfast on Pluto (film)|Breakfast on Pluto]]'', based on the novel of the same title by [[Patrick McCabe]]. Murphy had auditioned for the role in 2001, and though Jordan liked him for the part, ''[[The Crying Game]]'' director was hesitant to revisit transgender and [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] issues. For several years, Murphy lobbied Jordan to make the film before the actor became too old to play the part. In 2004, Murphy prepared for the role by meeting with a [[transvestite]] who dressed him and took him clubbing with other transvestites. Taking notice of the group's quick wit, Murphy attributed it to their constantly having to respond to insults from prejudiced people around them.<ref name="TONY 2005" />

Against ''Breakfast on Pluto''&#39;s kaleidoscopic backdrop of 1970s [[glitter rock]] fashion, magic shows, red light districts and IRA violence, Murphy transforms from androgynous teen to high [[drag (clothing)|drag]] [[blond bombshell]]. ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'''s Ruthe Stein said of his performance, "Murphy projects enormous energy onscreen, as he's already shown in ''28 Days Later...'' and ''Red Eye''. He's supremely well cast as the androgynous Kitten ... [and] smoothly makes the transition from broad comedy to drama.

[[David Denby]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' described his approach to the part: "Murphy is normally very quiet in movies; he has attained his mystique as an actor by staring at people with baby-blue eyes. In this film, too, he has, at times, a deep stillness, but he has idiosyncratic moments as well, such as when Damien has to execute a teen-ager who has ratted on the I.R.A. Murphy, writhing, shoots the boy and stumbles away, nausea struggling against duty."<ref name="Denby" />

Music is still a big part of Murphy's life.
