'''Wamsutta''' (b. c. [[1634]] - d. [[1662]]), also ''Alexander'' as he was called by [[New England]] colonists, was a leader ([[sachem]]) of the [[Wampanoag]] [[Native Americans in the United States|native American]] tribe. He was the son of [[Massasoit]], and brother of [[Metacomet]] who would succeed him. He married [[Weetamoo]].

== Leadership and death ==
In [[1660]], Massasoit died and Wamsutta assumed leadership of the Wampanoag. He substantially increased the power of the Wampanoag by selling land to other colonies (as a result of a collapse of the [[fur trade]]), and in [[1662]] this resulted in his being summoned to and seized by the [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]] Court. After being questioned Wamsutta became ill and died. The cause of death was disputed, and his brother Metacomet (who now assumed leadership of the Wampanoag) suspected that he was poisoned.

Wamsutta's death was one of the factors that would eventually lead to the [[1675]] [[King Philip's War]].

== Trivia ==
