'''Rudolf Jakob Camerarius''' or '''Camerer''' ([[February 12]], [[1665]]&ndash;[[September 11]], [[1721]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[botanist]] and [[physician]].

Camerarius was born at [[Tübingen]], and became [[professor]] of [[medicine]] and director of the [[botanical garden]]s at Tübingen in 1687. He is chiefly known for his investigations on the [[reproductive organ]]s of [[plant]]s (''De sexu plantarum epistola'' (1694)).

While other botanists, such as [[John Ray]] and [[Nehemiah Grew]], had observed that plants seemed to have [[sex]] in some form, and guessed that [[pollen]] was the male fertilizing agent, it was Camerarius who did experimental work. In studying the [[mulberry]], he determined that female plants not near to male (staminate) plants produced [[fruit]] but with no [[seed]]s. ''[[Mercury (plant)|Mercurialis]]'' and [[spinach]] plants fared likewise. With the [[castor oil plant]] (''Ricinus'') and with [[maize]] he cut off the staminate flowers (the "tassels" of maize), and likewise observed that no seeds formed. His results were reported in the form of a letter (the ''epistola''), and attracted immediate attention, subsequent workers extending his results from the [[monoecious]] plants he had studied to [[dioecious]] ones as well.
