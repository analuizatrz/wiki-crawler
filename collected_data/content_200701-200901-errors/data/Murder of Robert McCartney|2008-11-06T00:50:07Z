'''Robert McCartney''' (1971 &ndash; [[31 January]] [[2005]]) was the victim of a murder in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], allegedly carried out by members of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]. He was a father of two children and was engaged to be married in June 2005 to his long-term partner, Bridgeen Hagans. He was a [[Roman Catholic]] and lived in the predominantly [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] [[Short Strand]] area of [[East Belfast]] and was said by his family to be a supporter of [[Sinn Féin]].<ref name=suntrib>{{cite web

==Fight==
Robert McCartney was involved in an altercation in a bar &mdash; ''Magennis's'' &mdash; on May Street, in the centre of [[Belfast]], on the night of [[30 January]], [[2005]]. He was found by a police patrol car, unconscious with stab wounds, in Cromac Street and died in hospital the following morning. He was 33 years old.<ref name="BBC-1">{{cite news

The fight arose when his friend, Brendan Devine, was accused of making an insulting gesture or comment to a woman in the Co [[social club]]. When Devine refused to accept this or apologise, a brawl began. McCartney, who was attempting to defend Devine, was attacked with a broken bottle and then dragged into Verner Street, beaten with metal bars and stabbed.<ref name=suntrib/> Devine also suffered a knife attack, but survived. The throats of both men had been cut and McCartney's wounds included the loss of an eye and a large blade wound running from his chest to his stomach. Devine was hospitalised under armed protection.

In June 2005, Devine was sentenced to seven years in prison for taking part in a robbery on the outskirts of [[Belfast]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4620391.stm BBC: McCartney friend jailed over raid]</ref> On June 27th 2008 Terence Davison was found not guilty of committing the murder.

==Forensic cover up and investigation==

When the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland|police]] arrived at the scene, their efforts to investigate the pub and surrounding area was met with an impromptu riot. Rioting by youths, specifically attacking the police, forced them to pull back from the area, which delayed initial investigation. Police with [[riot gear]] arrived later in the evening, and were also attacked. [[Alex Maskey]] of Sinn Féin claimed, "It appears the PSNI is using last night's tragic stabbing incident as an excuse to disrupt life within this community, and the scale and approach of their operation is completely unacceptable and unjustifiable."<ref name="BBC-1"/> There have been suggestions that the rioting was organised by those involved in the murder, so that a clean up operation could take place in and around where the murder took place. Clothes worn by McCartney's attackers were burned, [[CCTV]] tapes were removed from the bar and destroyed and bar staff were threatened.<ref>{{cite web

==Political fallout==
[[Gerry Adams]], President of Sinn Féin, urged witnesses to come forward to "the family, a solicitor, or any other authoritative or reputable person or body".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4263359.stm BBC NEWS | Northern Ireland | Adams in appeal to catch killers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Adams continued, "I want to make it absolutely clear that no one involved acted as a republican or on behalf of republicans."  He suspended twelve members of Sinn Féin. Adams stopped short of asking witnesses to contact the police directly, unsurprising in light of Sinn Féin's historic lack of confidence in the police in Northern Ireland, whether it be the PSNI or its predecessor the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC). The usefulness of making witness statements to the victim's family or to a solicitor was derided by the McCartneys and by a prominent lawyer and SDLP politician, [[Alban Maginness]], soon afterwards.<ref>[http://www.sdlparchive.com/prmaginuessagreeswithmccartneyfamily.shtm Maginness Agrees With Mccartney Family After Us Consul Meeting<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On [[February 16]] the IRA issued a statement denying involvement in the murder and calling on the perpetrators to "take responsibility".<ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/ira/ira160205.htm CAIN: Events: Peace: Irish Republican Army (IRA) statement about the killing of Robert McCartney, (16 February 2005)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On [[March 8]] the IRA issued an unprecedented statement saying that four people were directly involved in the murder, that the IRA knew their identity, that two were IRA volunteers, and that the IRA had made an offer to McCartney's family to shoot the people directly involved in the murder.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,2763,1433163,00.html Full text of IRA statement | Special reports | Guardian Unlimited<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Since this time, the sisters of Robert McCartney have maintained an increasingly public campaign for justice (through the legal process) which saw [[Martin McGuinness]] make a public pronouncement that the sisters should be careful that they were not being manipulated for political ends.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4349183.stm BBC</ref>

The McCartney family travelled to the United States during the 2005 [[St Patrick's Day]] celebrations where they were met by US Senators (including [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[John McCain]]) and US President [[George W. Bush]] who expressed support in their campaign for justice.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4359491.stm BBC NEWS | Northern Ireland | Family encouraged by Bush talks<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Support for Sinn Féin by some American politicians was diminished. Gerry Adams was not invited to the [[White House]] in 2005 and Senator [[Edward Kennedy]] backed out of a meeting that had been previously scheduled.<ref name=hmcd>{{cite news

In December, the McCartney sisters met with UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, and told him they believed the murder had been ordered by a senior IRA member, and that Sinn Féin were still not doing all they could to help them.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4551468.stm BBC NEWS | Northern Ireland | McCartney 'killer plans US move'<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On 31 January 2007, two years after the murder, and in line with the Party's new policy of supporting civil policing, Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams said that anyone with information about the murder should go to the police.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6317565.stm BBC NEWS | Northern Ireland | Adams backs PSNI McCartney probe<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Criminal charges ==

On  [[May 5]] 2005, Terence Davison and James McCormick were remanded in custody, charged with murdering McCartney and attempting to murder Devine respectively.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4609435.stm BBC NEWS | Northern Ireland | Two remanded in McCartney killing<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> McCormick is originally from [[England]].

The trial of Terrence Davidson started on May the 22nd in Belfast Crown Court. Davidson is charged with murder, and with [[affray]] along with James McCormick and Joseph Gerard Emmanuel Fitzpatrick.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7411961.stm BBC NEWS | Northern Ireland |  Accused 'seen killing McCartney']</ref> Davison was found not guilty by Mr Justice Gillen on June 27nd 2008.

== Intimidation ==

The McCartney family had lived in the Short Strand area of Belfast for five generations. However some local people in the Short Strand area, which is a largely Nationalist area, did not welcome their dispute with the IRA. A campaign of intimidation by [[Irish Republicanism|Republicans]] drove members of the family and Robert's former fiancée, to relocate and has also caused one member to close her business in the city centre.<ref>{{cite web
