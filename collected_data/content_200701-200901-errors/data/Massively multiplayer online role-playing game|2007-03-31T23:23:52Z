'''''MMORPG''''' ('''Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game''') is a genre of [[online game|online]] [[computer role-playing game]]s (RPGs) in which a large number of [[player (game)|players]] interact with one another in a [[virtual world]].  

As in all [[role-playing game|RPGs]], players assume the role of a [[fictional character]] (most commonly in a fantasy setting) and take control over many of that character's actions. MMORPGs are distinguished from single-player or small multi-player RPGs by the number of players, and by the game's [[persistent world]], usually hosted by the game's [[video game publisher|publisher]], which continues to exist and evolve while the player is away from the game.

MMORPGs are very popular throughout the world, with combined global memberships in subscription and non-subscription games exceeding 15 million as of 2006.<ref name="subscribers">Chart of Subscriber Growth, http://www.mmogchart.com</ref> Worldwide revenues for MMORPGs exceeded half a billion dollars in 2005,<ref name="revenue">Parks Associates (2005), Online Gaming Revenues to Triple by 2009 http://www.parksassociates.com/press/press_releases/2005/gaming-1.html</ref> and Western revenues exceeded one billion USD in 2006.<ref>Piers Harding-Rolls (2007), Western World MMOG Market: 2006 Review and Forecasts to 2011, http://www.screendigest.com/reports/07westworldmmog/readmore/view.html</ref>

== Common features ==
Though MMORPGs have evolved considerably, many of them share some basic characteristics. Most MMORPGs are based on traditional ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' gameplay, including [[quest (gaming)|quests]], [[Mob (computer gaming)|monsters]], and [[Looting (gaming)|loot]]. As in ''Dungeons & Dragons'', there is usually the ability to develop a character after it has reached certain levels, which are reached after gaining enough [[experience points]] to do so. Often there are Game Moderators or Game Masters (frequently abbreviated to GM), which are sometimes-compensated individuals who attempt to supervise the world.

MMORPGs usually involve large communities of players and [[social network]]s, some having support for the creating of [[Clan (computer gaming)|Guilds or clans]], which are organizations of players. The "world" that players visit tends to be a persistent one where a client-server model is employed, in which the "world" software runs continuously on a server, and players connect to it via client software. 
For most MMORPGs, players either purchase the client software for a one-time fee or pay a monthly subscription to play. Most major MMORPGs require players to do both.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} By nature, "massively multiplayer" games are always online, and require some sort of continuous revenue (such as monthly subscriptions and advertisements) for maintenance and development.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} Games that feature massively-multiplayer functionality, but do not include roleplaying elements, are referred to as [[MMOG]]s.

Most MMORPGs share the common fact that a player can fight monsters alone without a group for awhile. Eventually they must find parties or groups of other players to get experience points because the monsters are too difficult to kill alone. Some MMORPGs like [[World of Warcraft]] break this tradition and let players solo to the highest level to make the game accessible to casual players or people who do not want to play for long periods of time.

== History==
[[Image:MUDscreen.jpg|thumb|260px|right|[[MUD]], the world's oldest multi-user roleplaying game]]
{{main|History of MMORPGs}}
MMORPGs as defined today have only existed since the early 1990s, when restrictions on use of the Internet were first relaxed.  Still, all MMORPGs can trace a lineage back to the earliest multi-user games, which started appearing in the late 1970s.  The first was [[MUD]], a non-graphical (text-based) world, though more would soon be developed for the [[PLATO]] system.  1984 saw two [[Roguelike]] multi-user game, called ''[[Islands of Kesmai]]'', and ''MAD''<ref>MAD, Multi Access Dungeon (1984-1986) http://www.lextrait.com/Vincent/mad.html</ref>, a global MUD which operated on [[BITNET]] from the US to Israel through Europe. The first truly graphical multi-user title was ''[[Neverwinter Nights (AOL game)|Neverwinter Nights]]'', which was delivered through [[America Online]] and was personally championed by AOL President [[Steve Case]].  The first success after the opening of the Internet was [[Meridian 59]], which also featured 3D graphics, although [[The Realm]] appeared nearly simultaneously and may be credited with bringing the genre to a wider player-base.  [[Ultima Online]], released in 1997, may be credited with first popularizing the genre, though [[Nexus: The Kingdom of the Winds]] was primarily responsible for mainstream attention throughout Asia, and it was [[Everquest]] that drove MMORPGs into the western mainstream.  After this point, competition in the genre brought MMORPG titles onto [[consoles]] and into science-fiction and comic-book settings.  The current market for MMORPGs has [[Blizzard]]'s [[World of Warcraft]] dominating, with over 50% of overall market share, though an additional market exists for free-to-play MMORPGs, which are supported by advertising and purchases of in-game items.

== Economics ==
{{see also|Real-money trading}}
Many MMORPGs feature living economies, as virtual items and currency have to be gained through play and have definite value for players.  Such a [[virtual economy]] can be analyzed (using data logged by the game) and has value in economic research; more significantly, these "virtual" economies can have an impact on the economies of the real world. 

One of the early researchers of MMORPG was Edward Castronova, who demonstrated that a supply-and-demand market exists for virtual items and that it crosses over with the real world.<ref name="poo">Castronova, Edward. Synthetic Worlds: The Business and Culture of Online Games. ISBN 0-226-09626-2, University Of Chicago Press</ref>  This crossover has some requirements of the game:

* The ability for players to sell an item to each other for in-game (virtual) currency.
* Bartering for items between players for items of similar value.
* The purchase of in-game items for real-world currency.
* Exchanges of real-world currencies for virtual currencies.

The idea of attaching real-world value to "virtual" items has had a profound effect on players and the game industry, and even the courts.  Castronova's first study in 2002 found that a highly liquid (if illegal) currency market existed, with the value of the in-game currency exceeding that of the Japanese yen.<ref name="CurrencyExchange">Online Game Economies Get Real (2002), http://www.wired.com/news/games/0,2101,55982,00.html</ref>  Some people even make a living by working these virtual economies; these people are often referred to as [[Farmer (gaming)|gold farmers]], and may be employed in [[game sweatshop]]s.

Game publishers usually prohibit the exchange of real-world money for virtual goods. However, a number of products actively promote the idea of linking (and directly profiting from) an exchange.  Some players of ''[[Second Life]]'' have generated revenues in excess of $100,000.<ref name="SecondLifeEconomy">My Virtual Life, Business Week (May 1, 2006) http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_18/b3982001.htm</ref> However, in the case of ''[[Entropia Universe]]'',  the virtual economy and the real-world economy are directly linked.  This means that real money can be deposited for game money and vice versa.  Real-world items has also been sold for game money in ''Entropia''.<ref name="EntropiaUniverseEconomy"> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropia_universe#Partnerships</ref>

Some of the issues confronting online economies include:

* The use of "bots" or automated programs, that assist some players in accumulating in-game wealth to the disadvantage of other players.<ref name="bots">Robert Shapiro (2003), How online games teach us about economics, http://www.slate.com/id/2078053/</ref>
* The use of unsanctioned auction sites, which has led publishers to seek legal remedies to prevent their use based on intellectual-property claims.<ref name="stopauctions">Blizzard Goes to War, http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2004/12/blizzard_goes_t.html</ref>
* The emergence of [[virtual crime]], which can take the form of both fraud against the player or publisher of an online, and even real-life acts of violence stemming from in-game transactions.<ref>BBC News (2005), Game Theft led to Fatal Attack, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4397159.stm</ref>

===Private servers===
One reaction to the virtual economies has been the phenomena of "private servers," which are servers operated by individuals and groups who have reverse-engineered commercial MMORPG products. Anyone who sets up their own private server has complete control over the virtual world existing on that server.  Typically, these servers operate in violation of publisher's end-user license agreements.  In November 2006, [[NCSoft]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] shut down a prominent private ''Lineage II'' server that had claimed 50,000 active users.<ref name="fbi">FBI, NCSoft drop hammer on MMORPG pirates, http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20061120-8258.html</ref>

Private servers are mostly run by volunteers, and are often free. However, some private servers may wish for people to donate money, sometimes in exchange for a bonus in the game. Private servers remain markedly less popular than the official servers, with player numbers usually in the hundreds, though popular private servers may reach up to one or two thousand online players and even up to ten thousand in terms of player registrations. ''[[EQEmu]]'' is a server emulator for ''[[EverQuest]]''; others exist for ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', ''[[Lineage II]]'', ''[[Ultima Online]]'', ''[[Ragnarok Online]]'', and many other MMORPGs.

== Psychology ==

Since the interactions between MMORPG players are real, even if the environments are not, [[psychologist]]s and [[sociologist]]s are also able to use MMORPGs as tools for academic research. [[Sherry Turkle]], a clinical psychologist, has conducted interviews with computer users including game-players.  Turkle found that many people have expanded their emotional range by exploring the many different roles (including gender identities) that MMORPGs allow a person to explore.<ref name="turkle">Sherry Turkle (1997), Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet, ISBN 0-684-83348-4</ref>

[[Nick Yee]] has surveyed more than 35,000 MMORPG players over the past few years, focusing on psychological and sociological aspects of these games. Recent findings included that 15% of players become a guild-leader at one time or another, but most generally find the job tough and thankless;<ref name="yee1">Nick Yee (2006), Life as a Guild Leader, http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/archives/001516.php</ref> and that players spend a considerable amount of time (often a third of their total time investment) doing things that are directly-related to, but outside of the game itself.<ref name="yee2">Nick Yee (2006) Time Spent in the Meta Game, http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/archives/001535.php</ref>

Many players report that the emotions they feel while playing an MMORPG are very strong, to the extent that 8.7% of male and 23.2% of female players in a statistical study have had an [[online wedding]].<ref>Yee (2003), An Ethnography of MMORPG Weddings, http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/archives/000467.php</ref> Other researchers have found that the enjoyment of a game is directly related to the social organization of a game, ranging from brief encounters between players to highly organized play in structured groups.<ref name="nardi harris">Nardi, Harris (2006), Strangers and Friends: Collaborative Play in World of Warcraft, Proceedings of the 2006 20th anniversary conference on Computer supported cooperative work</ref>

[[Richard Bartle]] has classified multiplayer RPG-players into four primary psychological groups.  His classifications were then expanded upon by Erwin Andreasen, who developed the concept into the thirty-question [[Bartle Test]] that helps players determine which category they are associated with.  With over 200,000 test responses as of 2006, this is perhaps the largest ongoing survey of multiplayer game players.<ref name="bartletest">Bartle Test of Gamer Psychology, http://www.guildcafe.com/bartle.php</ref>

Some members of the MMORPG community have jokingly viewed real-life as a major MMORPG. [http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/gamespotting/071103minusworld/1.html] [http://themot.org/gallery/d/62125-1/Outside.jpg]

== Development ==

In general, the cost of developing a commercial MMORPG title exceeds ten million dollars.<ref name="devcost">Adam Carpenter (2003), Applying Risk-Based Analysis to Play Balance RPGs, Gamasutra, http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20030611/carpenter_01.shtml</ref>  These projects require multiple disciplines within game design, 3D modeling, 2D art, animation, user interfaces, client/server engineering, database architecture and network infrastructure.<ref>Jon Radoff (2007), "Anatomy of an MMORPG," ''GuildCafe PlayerVox,'' http://www.guildcafe.com/Vox/04075-Radoff-MMO-Anatomy.html</ref>

The front-end (or client) component of a commercial, modern MMORPG features 3D graphics.  As with other modern 3D games, the front-end requires expertise with implementing [[3D engine]]s, real-time [[shader]] techniques and physics simulation.  The actual visual content (areas, creatures, characters, weapons, spaceships and so forth) is developed by artists who typically begin with two-dimensional concept art, and later convert these concepts into animated 3D scenes, models and texture maps.<ref name="3d game design">Frank Luna (2006), "3D Game Programming with DirectX 9.0c, a Shader Approach," Worldware Publishing, ISBN 1-59822-016-0</ref>

Developing an MMOG server requires expertise with client/server architecture, network protocols, security and relational database design.  MMORPGs include reliable systems for a number of vital tasks.  The server must be able to handle and verify a large number of connections; prevent [[Cheating in online games|cheating]]; and apply changes (bug fixes or added content) to the game.  A system for recording the game's data at regular intervals, without stopping the game, is also important.<ref name="game server">Jay Lee (2003), Gamasutra, Relational Database Guidelines for MMOGs, http://www.gamasutra.com/resource_guide/20030916/lee_01.shtml</ref>

Maintenance requires sufficient [[Server (computing)|server]]s and [[bandwidth]], and a dedicated support staff.  Insufficient resources for maintenance lead to [[lag]] and frustration for the players, and can severely damage the reputation of a game, especially at launch.  Care must also be taken to ensure that player population remains at an acceptable level by adding or removing servers ("shards").  [[Peer-to-peer]] MMORPGs could theoretically work cheaply and efficiently in regulating server load, but practical issues such as asymmetrical network bandwidth and CPU-hungry rendering engines make them a difficult proposition. Additionally, they would probably become vulnerable to other problems including new possibilities for [[cheating in online games|cheating]].  The hosted infrastructure for a commercial-grade MMORPG requires the deployment of hundreds (or even thousands) of servers.  Developing an affordable infrastructure for an online game requires developers to scale to large numbers of players with less hardware and network investment.<ref name="architecture">GDC Proceedings 2005, Online Game Architecture: Back-End Strategies, http://www.gamasutra.com/gdc2005/features/20050310/esbensen_01.shtml</ref>

In addition, the team will need to have expertise with the fundamentals of game design: world-building, lore and game mechanics,<ref name="game fundamentals">Chris Crawford (2003), Chris Crawford on Game Design, New Riders Games, ISBN 0-13-146099-4</ref> as well as what makes games fun.<ref name="fun games">Koster and Wright (2004), "A Theory of Fun for Game Design," Paraglyph Press, ISBN 1-932111-97-2</ref>

===Current trends===
As there are a number of wildly different titles within the genre, and since the genre develops so rapidly, it is difficult to definitively state that the genre is heading in one direction or another.  Still, there are a few obvious developments. One of these developments is the raid group quest, or "raid",<ref name="raid trend"> http://www.mmorpg.com/showFeature.cfm/loadFeature/1028</ref> which is an adventure designed for large groups of players (often twenty or more).

Another is the use of [[instance dungeons]].<ref name="instance trend"> http://www.blogtimesherald.com/entertainment/index.php?ArticleID=40&ShowMore=NO</ref>  These are game areas that are "copied" for individual groups, which keeps that group separated from the rest of the game world.  This reduces competition, and also has the effect of reducing the amount of data that needs to be sent to and from the server, which reduces lag.  ''World of Warcraft'''s "raids", mentioned above, are often instance dungeons, as are all of the combat areas in ''[[Guild Wars]]''.

Increased amounts of "Player-created content" may be another trend.<ref name="player content trend">Jon Radoff (March 20, 2007), Gamasutra, Five Prescriptions for Viral Games, http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20070320/radoff_01.shtml</ref> From the beginning the Ultima Online world included blank 30-page books that players could write in, collect into personal libraries and trade; in later years players have been able to design and build houses from the ground up. Some non-combat-based MMORPGs rely heavily on player-created content, including everything from simple animations to complete buildings using player-created textures and architecture.  Examples of these games include ''[[Second Life]]'' and ''[[A Tale in the Desert]]''.  However, these games are very different from the far more popular "standard" MMORPGs revolving around combat and limited character tradeskills.  Player-created content in these games would be in the form of areas to explore, monsters to kill, quests to carry out and specific in-game items to obtain. ''[[The Saga of Ryzom]]'' was the first of these "standard" MMORPGs to offer players the ability to create this type of content.  Again, whether or not this becomes mainstream is anyone's guess.

The production of movie "tie-in" games, common in other video game genres, may also begin to appear more frequently in MMORPGs.  The most recent example of this is ''[[The Matrix Online]]'', based on the Matrix trilogy of films; the earliest possibly was ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''.  Neither of these titles was a great financial success, probably due to their divergence from the original property. In addition to movie-license MMORPGs, there may be games produced on licenses from television; for example, ''[[Stargate Worlds]]'', based on the popular ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' and ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' television series, is currently under development.  The process is also apparently being applied in reverse, with [[James Cameron]] designing a MMORPG that will ''precede'' a film (''[[Project 880]]'') it is tied to.<ref name="Cameron">James Cameron's Game Theory, Business Week (Feb. 13, 2006) http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_07/b3971073.htm</ref>

Free content is also a popular trend in MMORPGs.  ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' and ''[[EVE Online]]'' both incorporated a free trial to the game, while others, like ''[[Anarchy Online]]'' and ''[[Shadowbane]]'', became completely free and available to download. Another popular trend that has shown great presence in MMORPGs is "player-driven" gameplay.  Player-driven gameplay relies on the players themselves for events and wars.  In this kind of setting, the NPCs or game world is affected by the players instead of the game company.  A great example of a player-driven MMORPG is ''[[Shadowbane]]'', where quests, and dungeons are non-existent.  ''[[Shadowbane]]'' allow players to own land, properties, provences and even nations.  Therefore the players are given the freedom to rage war on a foreign nation.

===Independent development===
[[Image:Daimonin Stoneglow night indexedto256.png|thumb|260px|right|''[[Daimonin]]'' is one of the independent efforts to create a free MMORPG.]]

Many small teams of programmers and artists have tried to create their own MMORPGs. As shown above, the average MMORPG development project requires enormous investments of time and money, and running the game can be a long-term commitment.  Independent development, or game development not run by any company, is therefore less common than corporate development.  Still, many independent MMORPGs do exist, representing a wide spectrum of genres, gameplay types, and revenue systems.

Some of the best-established independent projects are ''[[RuneScape]]'', ''[[AWplanet]]'', ''[[Crossfire (computer game)|Crossfire]]'', ''[[Daimonin]]'', ''[[Endless Online]]'', ''[[Star Wars Combine]]'', ''[[Eternal Lands]]'', ''[[Dream Blue Online]]'' and ''[[PlaneShift (game)|Planeshift]]''. Some independent MMORPG projects are completely [[open source]], such as ''[[Daimonin]]'', while others like ''Planeshift'' feature proprietary content made with an open-source game engine. The developers of ''Endless Online'' have also released development information with details about their coding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.endless-online.com/information.html|title=Endless Online Technical Information|accessmonthday=11|accessdaymonth=March|accessyear=2007|pages=|language=English}}</ref>

The [[WorldForge]] project has been active since 1998 and formed a community of independent developers who are working on creating framework for a number of open-source MMORPGs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://worldforge.org/doc/history|title=WorldForge History|accessmonthday=11|accessdaymonth =March|accessyear=2007|first=Bryce||language=English}}</ref> The [[Multiverse Network]] is also creating a network and platform specifically for independent MMOG developers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.multiverse.net/about/index.jsp?cid=5&scid=0|title=About Multiverse|accessmonthday=11|accessdaymonth=March|accessyear=2007|publisher=[[Multiverse]]|language =English}}</ref>

{{seealso|List of text-based MMORPGs}}

[[Image:LotGD.png|right|thumb|200px|''[[Legend of the Green Dragon]]'' is an example of a text-based MMORPG accessible with a web browser.]]

With the success of the MMORPG genre in recent years, several multiplayer games played in [[web browser]]s have also begun using the MMORPG moniker. This [[browser game]] sub-genre developed from old [[bulletin board system|BBS]] games and pre-dates the modern idea of an MMORPG. Browser-based MMORPGs are usually simpler games than their stand-alone counterparts, typically involving turn-based play and simple strategies (e.g. "build a large army, then attack other players for gold"), though there are many interesting variations on the popular themes to be found. Many browser-based MMORPGs are more like [[Turn-based MMORPG|turn-based]] [[strategy game]]s or [[wargame]]s than [[role-playing game]]s.

One of the earliest examples of a browser-based MMORPG is ''[[Archmage (computer game)|Archmage]]'', which dates back to early [[1999]]. More recently, faster computers and the [[Java platform|Java]] programming language have allowed the introduction of graphical browser-based MMORPGs such as ''[[RuneScape]]'', which are more similar to standalone MMORPGs.  Adobe's Flash Player 8 also provides functionality for a full function MMORPG such as ''[[Horse Isle RPG|Horse Isle]]'' and ''[[Dofus]]''. Macromedia's introduction of Shockwave 3D and the MUS Multiuser Server in 2001 makes it possible to create 3D browser-based MMORPGs based on the Shockwave plug-in.
