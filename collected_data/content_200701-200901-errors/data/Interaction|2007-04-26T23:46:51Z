'''Interaction''' is a kind of [[action (philosophy)|action]] that occurs as two or more objects have an [[effect]] upon one another. The idea of a two-way effect is essential in the concept of interaction, as opposed to a one-way [[causal]] effect. Combinations of many simple interactions can lead to surprising [[Emergence|emergent]] phenomena. ''Interaction'' has different tailored meanings in various [[science]]s.

All systems are related and interdependent. Every action has a consequence.

Casual examples of interaction outside of science include: 

* [[communication]] of any sort, for example two or more people talking to each other, or communication among [[Group (sociology)|group]]s, [[organisation]]s, [[nation]]s or [[state]]s: [[trade]], [[migration]], [[foreign relations]], [[transport|transportation]],
* the [[feedback]] during the operation of [[machine]]s such as a computer or tool, for example the interaction between a driver and the position of his or her car on the road: by steering the driver influences this position, by observation this information returns to the driver.

== Chemistry and medicine ==

In [[medicine]], most [[medication]]s can be safely used with other [[medicine]]s, but particular [[combination]]s of medicines need to be monitored for interactions, often by the [[pharmacist]]. In [[molecular biology]], the knowledge on [[gene]]/[[protein]] interaction among themselves and with their [[metabolite]]s is referred to as [[molecular pathway]]s.

Interactions between medications ([[drug interaction]]s) fall generally into one of two main categories; [[pharmacodynamic]] (involving the actions of the two interacting drugs), and [[pharmacokinetic]] (involving the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of one or both of the interacting drugs upon the other). 

In terms of efficacy, there can be three types of interactions between medications: additive, synergistic, and antagonistic. Additive interaction means the effect of two chemicals is equal to the sum of the effect of the two chemicals taken separately. This is usually due to the two chemicals acting on the body in the same way. Examples would be Aspirin and Motrin, Alcohol and Depressant, Tranquilizer and Painkiller. Synergistic interaction means that the effect of two chemicals taken together is greater than the sum of their separate effect at the same doses. An example is Pesticide and Fertilizer, the biological effect is devastating. Antagonistic interaction means that the effect of two chemicals is actually less than the sum of the effect of the two drugs taken independently of each other. This is because the second chemical increases the excretion of the first, or even directly blocks its toxic actions. Antagonism forms the basis for antidotes of poisonings. An example is Asparagus and birth control pills.

== Communications ==
{{main|Interactivity}}

In [[communications]], interactive communication occurs when [[communication source|sources]] take turns [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmit]]ting [[message]]s between one another. This should be distinguished from [[transactive communication]], in which sources transmit messages simultaneously.

== Media art==
In [[Mass media|media]], [[interactivity]] is a feature of the media in question and as digital technology becomes more accessible to the masses interest in interactivity is increasing and becoming a cultural trend especially in the arts. Interactivity can exist in virtual spaces or in real space. With virtual interaction the interaction usually takes place in the space of a computer with the monitor providing visual cues and the keyboard and mouse allowing interaction. In physical space the interaction usually involves sensors, actuators and computer systems with code that allow interactive systems to respond to human position, touch and sound.

== Physics ==
{{main|Fundamental force}}

In [[physics]], an '''interaction''' or [[force]] specifically refers to the action of one physical object upon another and results in a [[potential energy]] - the physical objects under consideration may range from [[Point (geometry)|point]] [[Elementary particle|particle]]s to [[quantum field theory|quantum field]]s. For example, the interaction of [[electric charge|charge]]d particles takes place through the mediation of [[electromagnetic field]]s, whereas [[beta decay]] occurs by means of the [[weak interaction]]. There are believed to be four [[fundamental force|fundamental interactions]] in Nature.

== Sociology ==
{{main|Social interaction}}

In [[sociology]], [[social interaction]] is a dynamic, changing sequence of [[social action]]s between individuals (or groups) who modify their actions and reactions due to the actions by their interaction partner(s). Social interactions can be differentiated into accidental, repeated, regular, and regulated. Social interactions form the basis for [[social relation]]s.

==Statistics==

{{main|interaction (statistics)}}

In [[statistics]], an '''interaction''' is a term in a [[statistical model]] in which the effect of two, or more, variables is not simply additive.

=== An example from statistics applied to psychology ===

If the two variables were sex and [[premature birth]] we would desribe any difference in scores between sexes as a [[main effect]]. Similiarly any difference in scores of full term/premature birth would be described as a [[main effect]]. When describing the scores one variable compared to the other this is describing the interaction as the sets of scores are in effect different variables interacting with one another.
