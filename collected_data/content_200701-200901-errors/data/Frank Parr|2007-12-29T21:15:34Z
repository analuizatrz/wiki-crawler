The game given below captured the attention of the chess world and he annotated it for an issue of [[British Chess Magazine]].  He even had a tapestry made up of one of the game's key positions, which he hung on the wall of his living room. [[Fred Reinfeld|Reinfeld]] and [[Irving Chernev|Chernev]], in their ''Fireside Book of Chess'' eulogize --- "In the opinion of the writers, Parr's masterpiece has well-founded claims to being considered the finest attacking game of all time." After the final move they exclaim "One of the greatest combinative games on record!"
