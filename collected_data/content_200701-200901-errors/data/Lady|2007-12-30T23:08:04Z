A '''lady''' is a [[woman]] who is the counterpart of a [[lord]], or the counterpart of a [[gentleman]].

== Etymology and usage ==
The word comes from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''hlǣfdige''; the first part of the word is a mutated form of ''hlāf'', "loaf, [[bread]]", also seen in the corresponding ''hlāford'', "lord". The second part is usually taken to be from the root ''dig-'', "to knead", seen also in [[dough]]; the sense development from bread-kneader, or bread-maker, or bread-shaper, to the ordinary meaning, though not clearly to be traced historically, may be illustrated by that of "lord".  

The primary meaning of "mistress of a household" is now mostly obsolete, save for the occasional use of old-fashioned phrases such as "the lady of the house." This meaning is retained, however, in the title [[First Lady]], used for the wife of an elected [[president]] or [[prime minister]]. In many [[European languages]] the equivalent term serves as a general [[form of address]] equivalent to the English ''[[Missus]]'' usually seen as ''Mrs.'' ([[French language|French]] ''[[Madame]]'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''Señora'', [[Italian language|Italian]] ''Signora'', [[German language|German]] ''Frau'', [[Polish language|Polish]] ''Pani'', etc.).

The special use of the word as a title of the [[Mary the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], usually ''Our Lady'', represents the [[Latin]] ''Domina Nostra''. In [[Lady Day]] and Lady Chapel the word is properly a [[genitive case|genitive]], representing ''hlǣfdigan'' "of the Lady".  

The word is also used as a title of the [[Wicca]]n Goddess, ''The Lady''.

== British usage ==
As a title of nobility the uses of "Lady" are mainly paralleled by those of "Lord". It is thus a less formal alternative to the full title giving the specific rank, of [[marchioness (title)|marchioness]], [[countess]], [[viscountess]] or [[baroness]], whether as the title of the husband's rank by right or courtesy, or as the lady's title in her own right. A widow becomes the [[dowager]], e.g. ''The Dowager Lady Smith''.

In the case of sons of a [[duke]] or [[marquess]], who by courtesy have "Lord" prefixed to their given and family name, the wife is known by the husband's given and family name with "The Lady" prefixed, e.g. ''The Lady John Smith''.  The daughters of dukes, marquesses and earls are by courtesy Ladies; here that title is prefixed to the given and family name of the lady, e.g. ''The Lady Jane Smith'', and this is preserved if the lady marries a [[commoner]], e.g. ''Mr John and The Lady Jane Smith''. The [[predicate]] 'The' should be used prior to "The Lady" or "Lord" in all cases, except after a divorce for women who do not hold the courtesy title of "Lady" in their own right, e.g. [[Heather McCartney|Heather, Lady McCartney]] or Jane, Lady Smith (the ex-wife of The Lord John Smith); cf [[Princess Diana|Diana, Princess of Wales]], that lady's final title after her divorce.

"Lady" is also the customary title of the wife of a [[baronet]] or [[knight]].  The proper title, now only used in [[legal documents]] or on [[sepulchral monuments]], is "[[Dame (title)|Dame]]".  In the latter case, "Dame" is prefixed to the given name of the wife followed by the surname of the husband, thus ''Dame Jane Smith'', but in the former, "Lady" with the surname of the husband only, ''Sir John and The Lady Smith''. When a woman divorces a knight and he marries again, the new wife will be ''The Lady Smith'' while the ex-wife becomes ''Jane, The Lady Smith''. If a knight dies, his widow becomes ''Dowager Lady Smith'' (no ''the''). 

During the [[fifteenth century|15th]] and [[sixteenth century|16th centuries]] [[princess]]es or daughters of the [[Royal family|blood royal]] were usually known by their first names with "The Lady" prefixed, e.g. ''The Lady Elizabeth''.

== More recent usage: social class ==
In more recent years, usage of the word ''the lady'' is even more complicated.  Journalist [[William Allen White]] noted one of the difficulties in his [[1946]] autobiography.  He relates that a woman who had paid a fine for prostitution came to his newspaper to protest, not that the fact of her conviction was reported, but that the newspaper had referred to her as a "woman" rather than a "lady."  Since that incident, White assured his readers, his papers referred to human females as "women", with the exception of [[justice of the peace|police court]] characters, who were all "ladies".  

White's anecdote touches on a phenomenon that others have remarked on as well. In the late [[nineteenth century|nineteenth]] and early [[twentieth century]], in a difference reflected in [[Nancy Mitford]]'s essay "[[U and non-U English|U vs. non-U]]", [[lower class]] women strongly preferred to be called "ladies" while women from higher social backgrounds were content to be identified as "women."   [[Alfred Ayers]] remarked in [[1881]] that upper middle class female store clerks were content to be "saleswomen," while lower class female store clerks, for whom their job represented a social advancement, indignantly insisted on being called "salesladies."  Something of this sense may also be underneath [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s lines:

:''The Colonel's lady and Rosie O'Grady &mdash;''
:''Sisters under the skin''

These [[social class]] issues, while no longer on the front burner in the [[twenty-first century]], have imbued the formal use of "lady" with something of an odour of [[irony]] (e.g: "my cleaning lady"). 

It remains in use [[colloquially]], for example, as a counterpart to "[[gentleman]]," in the phrase "[[ladies and gentlemen]]," and is generally interchangeable (in a strictly informal sense) with "woman" (as in, "The lady at the store said I could return this item within thirty days."). "Ladies" is also the normal text on the signs to any female [[toilet]] in a public place in the UK, again paired with "Gentlemen" (or "Gents").

== More recent usage: sexism (US) ==
[[Non-sexist language]] guidelines forbid its use to refer attributively to the sex of a working person, as in ''lady [[lawyer]]'' and ''lady [[Physician|doctor]]''. Many find these to have a condescending nuance not shared by ''female lawyer'' or ''woman doctor''; compare ''[[poetess]]'' for a similar problem. 

Advocates of non-sexist language recommend not using the word at all, whereas others permit its parallel use in the same circumstances in which a man would be called a gentleman or lord (for example, titling washrooms ''Men'' and ''Ladies'' would be considered sexist, but using either ''Men'' and ''Women'' or ''Ladies'' and ''Gentlemen'' would be acceptable; as is ''landlady'' as the parallel of ''landlord''.)

In the United States, notably among younger [[feminists]] of the [[1990s]] and [[2000s|00s]] influenced by [[riot grrl]], "lady" has occasionally been reclaimed in a more [[irony|ironic]] fashion. For example, [[Miranda July]]'s [[Joanie 4 Jackie]] [[chain letter]] [[videotape]] project is said to consist of "lady-made movies," a feminist music and video [[distributor]] in [[North Carolina]] called itself [[Mr. Lady Records]], and chorus of [[Le Tigre]]'s song "LT Tour Theme" from the album Feminist Sweepstakes (2000) declares itself to be written "for the ladies and the fags."
There are also worldwide feminist music and art festivals which the young feminists call [[ladyfest|ladyfests]].
