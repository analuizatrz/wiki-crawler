<!--If you disagree on whether to introduce it as "Wii" or "The Wii" then please speak up on the [[Talk:Wii]] page. -->The '''Wii''' (pronounced as the pronoun ''[[we]]'', [[IPA chart for English|IPA]]: {{IPA|[wiÀê]}}) is the fifth home [[video game console]] released by [[Nintendo]]. The console is the direct successor to the [[Nintendo GameCube]]. Nintendo states that its console targets a broader demographic than that of [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox 360]] and [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 3]],<!--FURTHER INFO ON DEMOGRAPHIC SHOULD BE ADDED TO BODY OF ARTICLE--><ref name="USA Today" /> but it competes with both as part of the [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh generation]] of gaming systems.

A distinguishing feature of the console is its [[wireless]] [[Game controller|controller]], the [[Wii Remote<!--SEE DISCUSSION ON "WIIMOTE"-->]], which can be used as a handheld [[pointing device]] and can [[motion detection|detect motion and rotation]] in [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]]. Another is [[WiiConnect24]], which enables it to receive messages and updates over the Internet while in [[standby mode]].<ref name="Iwata Speech 06">[http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n10/e3_2006/speech/english.html Nintendo Corporation] - Nintendo President, Satoru Iwata, media briefing speech at E3 2006</ref>

Nintendo first mentioned the console at the 2004 [[E3]] [[News conference|press conference]] and later unveiled the system at the 2005 E3. [[Satoru Iwata]] revealed a prototype of the controller at the September 2005 [[Tokyo Game Show]].<ref name="TGSspeech">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6133389.html|title=TGS 2005: Iwata speaks|accessdate=2006-09-24|last=Sinclair|first=Brendan|coauthors=Torres, Ricardo}}</ref> In the 2006 E3, the console won the first of several awards.<ref name="E3 Awards" /> By [[December 8]] [[2006]], it completed [[Wii launch|its launch]] in four key markets.

==History==
The console was conceived in [[2001 in video gaming|2001]], as the [[Nintendo GameCube]] was first seeing release. According to an interview with [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the concept involved focusing on a new form of player interaction. "The consensus was that power isn't everything for a console. Too many powerful consoles can't coexist. It's like having only ferocious dinosaurs. They might fight and hasten their own extinction."<ref name="Miyamoto Speaks">{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/nov2006/tc20061116_750580.htm|title=The Big Ideas Behind Nintendo's Wii |accessdate=2007-02-02|publisher=BusinessWeek|author=Kenji Hall }}</ref>

Two years later, [[game engine|engineers]] and [[game designer|designers]] were brought together to further develop the concept. By 2005, the controller interface had taken form, but a public showing at that year's [[E3]] was withdrawn. Miyamoto stated that "we had some troubleshooting to do. So we decided not to reveal the controller and instead we displayed just the console."<ref name="Miyamoto Speaks" /> [[Satoru Iwata]] later unveiled and demonstrated the [[Wii Remote]] at the September [[Tokyo Game Show]].<ref name="TGSspeech" />

The [[Nintendo DS]] is stated to have influenced the Wii design. Designer Ken'ichiro Ashida noted "We had the DS on our minds as we worked on the Wii. We thought about copying the DS's touch-panel interface and even came up with a prototype." The idea was eventually rejected, with the notion that the two gaming systems would be identical. Miyamoto also expressed that "if the DS had flopped, we might have taken the Wii back to the drawing board."<ref name="Miyamoto Speaks" />

===Name===
<!--DO NOT ADD a reference to urine to this article. If you think it needs to be added, please discuss it on the talk page.-->
The console was known by the [[code name]] of "Revolution" until [[April 27]] [[2006]], immediately prior to E3.<ref name="revolution renamed to wii">{{cite web|url=http://www.consolewatcher.com/2006/05/nintedo-revolution-renamed-to-nintendo-wii/|publisher=Console Watcher|work=Console Watcher|title=Nintendo Revolution Renamed To Nintendo Wii| accessdate=2006-11-03}}</ref> According to the Nintendo Style Guide, the name "is simply Wii, not Nintendo Wii." This means it is the first home console Nintendo has marketed outside of [[Japan]] without the company name featured in its trademark. While "Wiis" is a commonly used [[plural noun|pluralization]] of the console, Nintendo has stated that the official plural form is "Wii systems" or "Wii consoles."<ref name="The plural of Wii">{{cite news|publisher=Nintendo|url= http://gonintendo.com/?p=7288|title=The Plural of Wii|accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> Nintendo spells "Wii" with two lower-case "i" characters meant to resemble two people standing side by side, representing players gathering together, as well as to represent the console's controllers.<ref name="introducing_wii"/> The company has given many reasons for this choice of name since the announcement; however, the most well known is:

{{cquote|Wii sounds like 'we', which emphasizes that the console is for everyone. Wii can easily be remembered by people around the world, no matter what language they speak. No confusion. No need to abbreviate. Just Wii.<ref name="introducing_wii">{{cite web | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=9075|publisher=CMP| work=Gamasutra|title=Breaking: Nintendo Announces New Revolution Name - 'Wii'|accessdate=2006-09-16}}</ref>}}
Despite Nintendo's justification for the name, some [[game developer]]s and members of the press initially reacted negatively towards the change.

{{cquote|Revolution as a name is not ideal; it's long, and in some cultures, it's hard to pronounce. So we wanted something that was short, to the point, easy to pronounce, and distinctive. That's how 'Wii,' as a console name, was created.<ref>Michael Donahoe, Shane Bettenhausen {{cite news|title=War of the Words|pages=25|publisher=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]]|date=July 2006|url=<!--add web archive if available-->|accessdate = 2006-11-18}}</ref>}}

===Launch===

On [[September 14]] [[2006]], Nintendo announced release information for Japan, [[North America|North]] and [[South America]], [[Australasia]] (Oceania), [[Asia]], and [[Europe]], including dates, prices, and projected unit distribution numbers.

===Demographic===
Nintendo hopes to [[target market|target]] a wider [[demographic profile|demographic]] with its console than that of others in the [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh generation]].<ref name="USA Today" /> At a press conference for ''[[Dragon Quest IX: Defenders of the Sky|Dragon Quest IX]]'', [[Satoru Iwata]] iterated "We're not thinking about fighting [[Sony]], but  about how many people we can get to play games. The thing we're thinking about most is not portable systems, consoles, and so-forth, but that we want to get new people playing games."<ref name="IwataSony">{{cite web|title=Dragon Quest IX Q&A|date=[[2006-12-12]]|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2006-12-16
|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/750/750610p1.html}}</ref>

This is reflected in Nintendo's series of [[television advertisement]]s in North America, directed by [[Academy Award]] winner [[Stephen Gaghan]], as well as Internet ads. The ad slogans are ''"Wii would like to play"'' and ''"Experience a new way to play''." These ads ran starting [[November 15]] [[2006]] and had a total budget of over [[United States dollar|$]]200 million throughout the year.<ref>joystiq.com [http://www.joystiq.com/2006/11/12/nintendo-wii-marketing-to-exceed-200-million/ "Nintendo Wii Marketing To Exceed 200 million"] (November 12, 2006)</ref> The productions are Nintendo's first broad-based advertising strategy and include a two-minute [[video clip]] showing a varied assortment of people enjoying the Wii system, such as urban apartment-dwellers, country ranchers, grandparents and parents with their children. The music in the ads is from the song "Kodo (Inside the Sun Remix)" by the [[Yoshida Brothers]].<ref name="jap_commercial">{{cite web|title=Wii For All - Wii Would Like To Play|date=[[2006-12-10]]|publisher=Duncan's TV Land|accessdate=2007-01-16

==Hardware==
[[Image:Wii Blockbuster Display.jpg|thumb|right|245px|Wii retail display boxes]]
The Wii console is Nintendo's smallest home unit to date; it measures 44&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]] (1.73&nbsp;[[inch|in]]) wide, 157&nbsp;mm (6.18&nbsp;in) tall, and 215.4&nbsp;mm (8.48&nbsp;in) deep in its vertical orientation, the near-equivalent of three [[keep case|DVD cases]] stacked together. The included stand measures 55.4&nbsp;mm (2.18&nbsp;in) wide, 44&nbsp;mm (1.73&nbsp;in) tall, and 225.6&nbsp;mm (8.88&nbsp;in) deep, The system weighs 1.2&nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]] (2.7&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]),<ref name="WiiWeight">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,127859-page,1/article.html|title=A Closer Look at the Nintendo Wii}} pcworld.com. Retrieved on [[March 8]] [[2007]].</ref> which makes it the lightest of the three major [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh generation]] consoles. The console can be placed either horizontally or vertically. The prefix for the numbering scheme of the system and its parts and accessories is "RVL-" after its [[project code name]] of "Revolution".<ref>{{cite news|title=Wii controller world tour|pages=8|publisher=[[Ngamer]]|date=July 13, 2006|url=<!--add web archive if available-->|accessdate=2007-01-01}}</ref>

The front of the console features an illuminated slot-loading optical media drive that accepts both 12&nbsp;cm Wii Optical Discs and [[Nintendo GameCube Game Disc]]s. The blue light in the disc slot illuminates briefly when the console is turned on, and pulsates when new data is received through [[WiiConnect24]]. When there is no WiiConnect24 information, the light is off. The disc slot light remains off during [[Gameplay|game play]] or when using other features. Two [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ports are located at its rear, and an [[Secure Digital Card|SD card]] slot hides behind the cover on the front of the console. The SD card can be used for uploading photos as well as backing up [[saved game]] data and downloaded [[Virtual Console]] games. As a presently impenetrable system of [[digital rights management]], Virtual Console data cannot be restored to any system except the unit of origin.<ref name="Nintendo Forums: SD CARD ISSUE (from one system to another)">{{cite web|url=http://forums.nintendo.com/nintendo/board/message?board.id=wii_tech&message.id=4874
|title=Nintendo Forums: SD CARD ISSUE (from one system to another) |accessdate=2006-12-10 |date=December 10, 2006}}</ref> To use the SD slot for game save transferring, a [[patch (computing)|software update]] must be downloaded, so a system that has not been connected to the Internet cannot utilize this feature. The SD card can also be used to create customized in-game music from stored MP3 files, as shown in ''[[Excite Truck]]''.

Nintendo has shown the console and the Wii Remote in white, black, silver, lime green, and red,<ref name="Rev colors console">{{cite web |url=http://media.revolutionreport.com/image/revofficial%204.jpg |publisher=Revolution Report |title=Wii Colors |accessdate=2006-07-15}}</ref><ref name="Rev colors control">{{cite web | url=http://news.com.com/i/ne/p/2005/0916nintendopic4_500x375.jpg | title=Wii Remote Colors | publisher=news.com | accessdate=2006-07-15}}</ref> but has initially been available only in white. At E3 2006, the Wii Remote was shown in light blue. Shigeru Miyamoto stated that other colors would be available after the easing of supply limitations, which were stated to continue until (northern) Spring.<ref name="WiiQuotables">[http://wii.ign.com/articles/732/732873p1.html Wii Ouotables] IGN.com. Retrieved on [[March 10]] [[2007]].</ref> Numerous minor changes were made to the design between its original unveiling and launch, including the Nintendo branding used and button placements.

The [[Wii launch]] package includes the console, a stand to allow the console to be placed vertically, a circular clear stabilizer for the main stand, one [[Wii Remote]], one [[Wii Remote#Nunchuk|Nunchuk]] attachment, one [[Wii Remote#Sensing|Sensor Bar]], a removable stand for the bar, one external main [[power supply|power adapter]], two [[AA battery|AA batteries]], one [[composite video|composite AV cable]] with [[RCA connector]]s ([[component video]] and other types of cables are available separately), operation documentation, and (in all regions excluding Japan) a copy of ''[[Wii Sports]]''.

A Nintendo spokesperson has announced that the company plans to release a version of the console with [[DVD-Video]] playback capabilities in 2007.<ref name="DVD-Wii 2007" /> Even though software will be used to enable DVD-Video functionality, it "requires more than a firmware upgrade" and cannot therefore be implemented through the WiiConnect24 network.<ref name="DVD-Wii 2007">{{cite web|url=http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/feature/?id=14430 |title=GameDaily BIZ: Confirmed: Nintendo to Release DVD-Enabled Wii in 2007 |accessdate=2006-11-14 |date=November 13, 2006}}</ref>

[[Image:Wiimote-lite2.JPG|thumb|right|200px|From left to right: [[Nintendo DS Lite]], [[Wii Remote#Nunchuk|Nunchuk]], [[Wii Remote]], and [[Wii Remote#Strap|strap]]]]
The Wii Remote<!--SEE DISCUSSION ON "WIIMOTE"--> is a [[game controller|controller]] that uses a combination of [[accelerometer]]s and [[infrared]] detection (from an array of [[light-emitting diode|LEDs]] inside the [[Wii Remote#Sensing|Sensor Bar]]) to sense its position in [[three-dimensional space|3D]] space. This design allows users to control the game using physical gestures as well as traditional button presses. The controller connects to the console using [[Bluetooth]], and features [[Haptic#Games|rumble]] and an internal speaker. The Wii Remote can connect to other devices through a [[proprietary]] port at the base of the controller. The device bundled with the Wii retail package is the [[Wii Remote#Nunchuk|Nunchuk]] unit, which features an accelerometer and a traditional [[analog stick]] with two trigger buttons.<!--FURTHER INFO ATTACHMENTS SHOULD BE ADDED TO "WII REMOTE" ARTICLE--> In addition, an attachable [[Wii Remote#Strap|wrist strap]] can be used to prevent the player from unintentionally dropping or throwing the Wii Remote.

===Technical specifications===
Nintendo has released few technical details regarding the Wii system, but some key facts have leaked from the press. Though none of these reports has been officially confirmed, they generally point to the console as being an extension or advancement of the previous [[Nintendo GameCube]] core architecture. More specifically, the reported analyses state that the Wii is roughly 1.5 to two times as powerful as its predecessor.<ref name="Wii: The Total Story" /><ref name="IGN Wii FAQs">{{cite web| last=Casamassina|first=Matt|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/733/733464p7.html|title=IGN's Nintendo Wii FAQ|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2006-11-11}}</ref>

===Technical issues===
The first firmware update via WiiConnect24 caused a very small portion of units to become completely [[Brick (electronics)|unusable]]. This forced users to either send their units to [[Nintendo]] for repairs (if they wished to retain their saved data), or exchange it for a free replacement.<ref name="Wii Firmware down">{{cite web| url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=149572| title=Wii Connect 24 Kills Wiis| publisher= ComputerAndVideoGames.com}}</ref> It has also been reported that during standby mode, the Wii can overheat to the point of damaging the GPU, causing pixelation problems, such as random dark or green pixels, to appear. As of [[April 21]] [[2007]], it is possible to contact Nintendo and send it for repair.<ref>[http://wii.qj.net/Wii-overheat-causes-video-output-error/pg/49/aid/77236 Wii Overheat Causes Video Output Error] qj.net. Retrieved on [[February 16]] [[2007]].</ref>

===Legal issues===
[[Interlink Electronics]] filed a patent-infringement lawsuit against Nintendo over the pointing functionalities of the Wii Remote, claiming, "loss of reasonable royalties, reduced sales and/or lost profits as a result of the infringing activities" of Nintendo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/750/750001p1.html|title=Nintendo Sued for Patent Infringement|author=Micah Seff|publisher=IGN|date=2006-12-08|accessdate=2006-12-08}}</ref> [[Anascape]] Ltd, a [[Texas]]-based firm, also filed a lawsuit against Nintendo for patent infringements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=33466|title=Microsoft, Nintendo sued over games controller |author=INQUIRER staff|publisher=The Inquirer|date=2006-8-03|accessdate=2006-12-08}}</ref> Green Welling LLP filed a [[class action lawsuit]] against Nintendo for their "defective wrist straps."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2006_Dec_16/ai_n16911839|title=Nintendo Recalls Defective Wii Wrist Straps After Class Action Filed by Green Welling LLP|accessdate=2007-03-23|publisher=Business Wire|date=2006-12-16}}</ref><br />

==Features==
The console contains a number of internal features made available from its hardware and [[firmware]] components. The hardware allows for extendibility through expansion ports while the firmware can receive periodic updates via the [[WiiConnect24]] service.
<!-- The latest firmware version for the Wii system is 2.2U. In order to use Channels requiring Internet access, a firmware update is required.<ref name="IGN Firmware">{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/745/745341p1.html|title=IGN: Wii Channels to Require Upgrade|accessdate=2006-10-12|date=2006-10-10}}</ref> -->

===Wii Menu===
{{main|Wii Menu}}
[[Image:Nintendo Wii Channels.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Wii Menu]]
The Wii Menu [[operating system]] interface is designed around the concept of [[television channel]]s. Separate channels are graphically displayed in a grid and are navigated using the pointer capability of the [[Wii Remote]]. It is possible to change the arrangement of the channels by holding down the A and B buttons. There are six primary channels: <!--BOLDING CHANNELS IS NOT NEEDED-->the Disc Channel, Mii Channel, Photo Channel, Wii Shop Channel, Forecast Channel, and News Channel. The Forecast Channel was released on [[December 19]] [[2006]].<ref name="ForecastChannel">{{cite web|url=http://aussie-nintendo.com/?v=news&p=8883|title=Nintendo's Wii Forecast Channel now live in Oz|publisher=Aussie-Nintendo.com|date=2006-12-19|accessdate=2006-12-19}}</ref> The News Channel was released on [[January 26]] [[2007]].<ref name="WiiNewsChannel">{{cite web|url=http://wii.nintendo.com/wiimenu.jsp|title=Wii Menu|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2006-12-19}}</ref> Additional channels are available for download from the Wii Shop Channel and also appear with each [[Virtual Console]] title. The [[Everybody Votes Channel]] was released on [[February 13]] [[2007]].<ref name="EverybodyVotes">{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoplayers.com/article.php?articleID=708|title=Nintendo Players - Nintendo Unleashes 'Everybody Votes' Channel|accessdate=2007-03-20}}</ref> The full version of the Internet Channel was released on [[April 11]] [[2007]] and will be free if downloaded before the end of June. After June, a fee of 500 [[Wii Points]] will be required for purchase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/31591/98/ |title=Nintendo launches full version of Wii Internet channel |accessdate=2007-04-12}}</ref><!--FURTHER INFO SHOULD BE ADDED IN THE "WII MENU" ARTICLE-->

===Backward compatibility===
[[Image:Wii in GameCube modus.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[Nintendo GameCube]] ports on the top of the Wii unit]]
<!--- Wii Download Games Should NOT Be Mixed With Launch Titles --->
The Wii console is [[backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with all official [[Nintendo GameCube]] software, as well as [[Nintendo GameCube Memory Card]]s and controllers. Compatibility with software is achieved with the slot-loading drive's ability to accept [[Nintendo GameCube Game Disc]]s. The console supports progressive-scan output in 480p-enabled Nintendo GameCube titles. The Wii is also compatible with the GameCube [[Action Replay]], which will work with GameCube games. Peripherals can be connected via a set of four GameCube controller ports and two Memory Card slots concealed by flip-open panels.<ref name="Wii: The Total Story" /> A GameCube controller is required to play [[List of GameCube games|GameCube titles]], as neither the [[Wii Remote]] nor the [[Wii Remote#Classic Controller|Classic Controller]] functions in this capacity. A Nintendo GameCube Memory Card is also necessary to save, as the Wii internal flash memory will not save GameCube games. 

Backward compatibility is limited in some areas. Online and LAN-enabled features for Nintendo GameCube titles are unavailable on the Wii, as the console lacks serial ports for the [[Nintendo GameCube Broadband Adapter|Broadband Adapter]] and [[Nintendo GameCube Modem Adapter|Modem Adapter]]. The Wii uses a proprietary port for video output and is therefore incompatible with Nintendo GameCube [[composite video]], [[S-Video]], and [[component video]] cables. The console also lacks [[Game Boy Player]] support.
<!--INFO ON VIRTUAL CONSOLE GAMES SHOULD NOT BE ADDED HERE-->

===Nintendo DS connectivity===
The Wii system supports wireless connectivity with the [[Nintendo DS]] without any additional accessories.<ref name="policy brief" /> The connectivity allows the player to use the Nintendo DS microphone and [[touchscreen]] as inputs for Wii games. The first example Nintendo has given of a game using Nintendo DS-Wii connectivity is that of ''[[Pok√©mon Battle Revolution]]''. Players with either [[Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok√©mon Diamond'' or ''Pearl'']] are able to play battles using their Nintendo DS as a controller.<ref name="connectivity returns">{{cite web|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|authorlink=|coauthors=|date=[[June 7]], [[2006]]|year=|month=|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/711/711657p1.html|title=Connectivity Returns|format=|work=|pages=|publisher=IGN|language=|accessdate=2006-06-07|accessyear=|curly=}}</ref> It has also been announced that the Nintendo DS will be able to play [[game demo]]s downloaded from the console, which they would receive from Nintendo, similar to a [[DS Download Station]].<ref name="Iwata Tech-On 3">{{cite web|author=Naoki Asami|authorlink=|coauthors=ITpro Publisher; Hiroki Yomogita, Silicon Valley|date=[[2006-05-25]]|year=|month=|url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20060525/117498/?P=3|title=Regaining what we have lost: Nintendo CEO Iwata's Ambitions for the "Wii"|format=|work=Tech-On!|pages=3|publisher=Nikkei Business Publications|language=|accessdate=2006-06-09|accessyear=|curly=}}</ref> The console is also able to expand Nintendo DS games.<ref name="connectivity returns" />

===Online connectivity===
{{main|Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection|WiiConnect24|Virtual Console|Internet Channel}}
The Wii unit is able to connect to the Internet through its built-in [[IEEE 802.11#802.11b|802.11b]]/[[IEEE 802.11#802.11g|g]] Wi-Fi or through a USB-to-Ethernet adapter, with both methods allowing players to access the established [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]] service.<ref name="Wii: The Total Story" /> [[Wireless LAN Security|Wireless encryption]] by [[Wired Equivalent Privacy|WEP]], [[Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]] (TKIP/RC4) and [[IEEE 802.11i|WPA2]] (CCMP/AES) are supported.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/onlineWirelessRouterChoose.jsp|title=Choosing a Wireless Router |accessdate=2006-12-13|publisher=Nintendo.com}}</ref> Just as for the Nintendo DS, Nintendo does not charge fees for playing via the service<ref name="USA Today">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2006-08-14-nintendo-qa_x.htm |title=Nintendo hopes Wii spells wiinner |accessdate=2006-08-16|date=[[2006-08-15]]|work=USATODAY.com|publisher=[[USA Today]]}}</ref><ref name="Nintendo Wii Wi-Fi page">{{cite web|author=sjohnson|date=[[2006-07-18]]|year=|month=|url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/TheFeed/post/618959/Secret_Wii_Details_Revealed.html|title=Secret Wii Details Revealed|format=|work=The Feed|publisher=G4 Media, Inc.|accessdate=2006-07-20|accessyear=}}</ref> and the Friend Code system controls how players connect to one another. It is reported that only one Wii system code is required.<ref name="Wii Wi-Fi Just Like DS">{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/707/707865p1.html|title=Wii Wi-Fi Just Like DS|last=Casamassina |first=Matt accessdate=2006-05-11}}</ref><ref name="Nintendo Wii Wi-Fi page" /> This system also implements console-based software including the Wii Message Board.

The service has several features for the console including the [[Virtual Console]], [[WiiConnect24]], [[Internet Channel]], [[Wii Menu#Forecast Channel|Forecast Channel]], [[Everybody Votes Channel]], and the [[Wii Menu#News Channel|News Channel]]. The console can also communicate and connect with other Wii systems through a self-generated wireless [[local area network|LAN]], enabling local wireless multiplayer on different television sets. ''[[Battalion Wars 2]]'' first demonstrated this feature for non-split screen multiplayer between two or more televisions.<ref>[http://wii.ign.com/articles/727/727651p1.html Battalion Wars 2 - Hands On] [[IGN]]. Retrieved on [[January 25]] [[2007]].</ref>

===Parental controls===
The console features [[parental controls]], which prohibit younger users from playing games with content considered unsuitable for their age level. When a Wii or Virtual Console game is attempted to be played, it reads the content rating encoded in the game data; if this rating is greater than the system's set age level the game will not load without a correct override password. The parental controls can also restrict Internet access, which blocks the Internet Channel and system update features. Since the console is restricted to GameCube functionality when playing Nintendo GameCube Game Discs, GameCube software is unaffected by Wii parental control settings.

European units mainly use the [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]] rating system,<ref name="par_pegi">{{cite news|url=http://planetgamecube.com/news.cfm?action=item&id=6665 | title=Revolution To Feature Parental Controls|publisher=Planet GameCube|date=2005-11-16}}</ref> whereas North American units use the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] rating system.<ref name="par_esrb">{{cite press release|url=http://www.nintendo.com/newsarticle?articleid=z5UnNGZpQKWULzG0z8R501PA5IHoNPr2|title=Nintendo Announces Play Control System For Next Hardware|publisher=Nintendo of America|date=[[2005-11-16]]}}</ref> The Wii unit supports the native rating systems of many countries, including [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization|CERO]] in [[Japan]], the [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle|USK]] in [[Germany]], both the [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]] and [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (Australia)|OFLC]] in Australia and [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (New Zealand)|New Zealand]].

[[Perrin Kaplan]] had originally stated that the system would be region-free.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/09/14/first-party-wii-games-will-be-region-free/|Author=Ludwig Kietzmann|date=2006-09-14| title=First-party Wii games would be region-free (update 2)|publisher=joystiq|accessdate=2006-11-03}}</ref> However, corrections from Nintendo of America and Nintendo of Europe concurred that the console does support [[regional lockout]].<ref name="notregionfree">{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/09/15/wii-not-even-remotely-region-free/|Author=Ludwig Kietzmann|date=2006-09-14|title=Wii not even remotely region-free|publisher=Joystiq|accessdate=2006-12-06}}</ref>

Retail copies of Wii games are supplied on [[DVD]]-like [[optical discs]], which have a capacity of 8.5 [[Gigabyte]]s. Wii Optical Discs are packaged in a [[keep case]] along with instruction information. On European releases, these retail boxes have a triangle printed at the bottom corner of the paper insert sleeve side. The hue of the triangle can be used to identify which region the particular title is intended for and which manual languages are included.

==Reception==
<!--DO NOT REMOVE CONTENT WITHOUT A DISCUSSION-->
The system was well-received after its exhibition at [[History of E3|E3 2006]]. At the event, Nintendo's console won the [[Game Critics Awards]] for Best of Show and Best Hardware.<ref name="E3 Awards">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamecriticsawards.com/win.html|title=2006 Winners|accessdate=2006-08-13|work=Game Critics Awards}}</ref> In the December 2006 issue of ''[[Popular Science]]'' the console was awarded with the Grand Award Winner in Home Entertainment.<ref name="pop-sci-nov06-80">{{Harvard reference|Title=Best of What's New 2006 - Home Entertainment| Journal=Popular Science|Volume=269|Issue=6|Year=2006|Page=80}}</ref> [[Spike TV]]'s Video Games Award also granted the console the award in breakthrough technology.<ref name="Spike TV Award">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6162929.html?tag=latestnews;title;0|title=Oblivion nabs Spike TV top honors|accessdate=2007-03-10|work=Gamespot}}</ref> [[GameSpot]] chose the console as the Best Hardware on their Best and Worst 2006 awards show.<ref name="Gamespot Award">{{cite web|url= http://www.gamespot.com/special_features/bestof2006/achievement/index.html?page=21|title=GameSpot Best Games and Worst Games of 2006|accessdate=2007-03-10|work=Gamespot}}</ref> The system was also chosen as one of ''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]'' magazine's 20 Most Innovative Products of the Year.<ref name="PC World Award">{{cite web|url= http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,128176-page,2-c,electronics/article.html|title=PC World 20 Most Innovative Products of the Year 2006|accessdate=2007-03-10|work=PC World}}</ref>  

At the same time, criticism of the Wii Remote and the Wii hardware has surfaced.
