'''Fighting in ice hockey''' is a [[controversy|controversial]] aspect of the sport. Fighting is tolerated in most levels of hockey, with the various [[Penalty (ice hockey)|penalties]] assigned being tiered depending on the age and skill level of the leagues. Fighting is condoned in the [[National Hockey League]], the North American junior leagues, and other North American professional minor leagues, where a five minute major penalty is given. However, fighting is punishable by ejection in the Peewee, College and European leagues, as in women's hockey at any level. Although it results in a major penalty, players who engage in fighting (except for instigating) do not get ejected from the game. Hockey remains the only major professional non-combat sport in North America to not eject players for fighting. Fights often are a reaction to an on-ice incident during a game, though it has become more common for two opposing players (usually the [[enforcer (hockey)|enforcer]] for each team) to mutually agree to a fight, which usually occurs right after a [[faceoff]]. There are strategies on when, where, and how to fight, and these are difficult skills to learn.

Despite its detractors, hockey fighting remains popular with many fans and it is a common occurrence for fights to be replayed on sports news shows.

== The Dance ==
The hockey fight is like [[professional boxing]], a somewhat ritualized affair with clear rules between acceptable and unacceptable behavior. The rulebook of the [[National Hockey League]] (as well as numerous other professional leagues) contains a specific code of behavior for fighting, thereby making hockey the only professional non-[[combat sport]] to maintain a written set of rules for fight conduct. These rules state that at the initiation of a fight, both players must drop their sticks (for fear of them being used as a weapon. Players must also "drop" or shake off their protective gloves in order to fight bareknuckled, as the hard leather and plastic of hockey gloves (designed to protect players' hands from damage by the flying puck and wayward sticks) would actually worsen the effect of landed blows, rather than providing a cushioning effect, as boxing gloves do. Players must also heed the referee's warning to end a fight once the combatants have been separated. Failure to adhere to any of these rules results in an immediate game misconduct penalty, and the possibility of suspension from future games.

The acceptable form is boxing/grappling between a pair of players. They will maneuver themselves to either tie up their opponents' arms, or free an arm for a punch to the opponent's face/head. This form of combat is known in hockey [[parlance]] as the "dance," as the players will often circle each other in a grapple, looking for an advantage. When a pair of well-matched opposing players engage in a fight, the action of the officials is to back off while blows are actively being thrown. Usually very quickly one or both of the combatants will clinch the other so that punches can no longer be thrown, often falling to the ice in the process, or one of the combatants will "turtle" (that is, duck one's head inside one's jersey to avoid punches) -- this is when the officials will enter the fray and carefully separate the combatants.

It is not uncommon for one or the other combatants to be bloodied, but significant injuries are rare. The most common injuries are facial [[lacerations]], [[bruises]], and broken noses. This partially has to do with the poor balance a person has on skates. A devastating punch is more difficult to land when one still must focus their balance and weight to some degree on their feet. Thus, some significant injuries have occurred when the unwritten rules are broken and one player has a significant balance advantage (for example, a punch on a player who is being restrained by officials, or a downward punch on a player who is already knocked down and lying prone). The NHL often suspends players who take this course.

== Consequences of fighting ==
In the [[National Hockey League]], [[American Hockey League]], [[ECHL]], [[Central Hockey League|CHL]], [[UHL]], and other notable minor leagues, officials punish combatants with five-minute major penalties for fighting (hence the phrase "five for fighting"). A player is automatically ejected and suspended if the player tries to leave the bench to join a fight (known as the ''third man in'' rule), and is also automatically ejected for using weapons of any kind (such as using a skate to kick an opponent, using a stick to hit an opponent, or wrapping tape around one's hands), as they can cause serious injury. A player who receives two instigator penalties in one game is also ejected automatically. Furthermore, his coach can be suspended up to ten games for allowing players to leave the bench to join a fight.

Also, a player who commits three major penalties, including fighting, during a game is automatically ejected, suspended, and fined. A player ejected for three major penalties in a game, or for use of weapons, cannot be replaced for five minutes.

In 2003, the ECHL added an ejection, fine, and suspension of an additional game for any player charged as an instigator of a fight during the final five minutes of the third period or any overtime. The NHL and AHL adopted the rule in 2005-06, and add a fine for the coach in the NHL.

In Division I & III [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] hockey, the fighters are given a Game Disqualification, which is an ejection from the game and a suspension for as many games as the player has accrued Game Disqualifications during the course of a season. For example, if a player engages in a fight having already received a Game Disqualification earlier in the season, he is ejected from the game and then suspended for his team's next two games. This automatic suspension has tended to make fighting in college hockey relatively rare.

Although these measures help prevent the escalation of a single fight from becoming a [[bench-clearing brawl]] occasionally seen in [[baseball]], bench-clearing brawls did occur in hockey until most leagues instituted penalties for leaving the bench to fight.  In the past, enough players have been ejected so that a team may not have enough players to continue playing, but this is now rare. One of the most infamous bench-clearing brawls was in the [[1987]] [[IIHF]] [[World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]] game between [[Canada]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. This resulted in both teams' disqualification; a Canadian in the fight was future NHL star [[Theoren Fleury]]. In some cases, players have been [[Violence in ice hockey#Incidents Resulting in Charges|criminally charged for their on-ice actions]].

It has been frequently argued that fighting is not necessary in hockey; however, it remains in the game to this day. Proponents argue that it remains vital as it can set a "tone", it increases the game's intensity, and it allows for players to further motivate their teammates and gain momentum. Proponents also argue that when fighting is suppressed, players are more likely to engage "dirty" plays, such as "stick work" (the use of the stick as a weapon), which is far more dangerous to players than fighting. Moreover, proponents also claim fighting to be an important means of protecting a star player who is being brutalized by an opponent. Opponents of fighting retort that international and college hockey, which both harshly penalize fighting with suspensions, lack incidents such as "stick work" proponents claim to fear.  Opponents also note that North American professional ice hockey players are unique to major professional team sports in that they are incapable of controlling themselves on the ice without fighting. 

The unique condoning of fighting in ice hockey led to [[Rodney Dangerfield]]'s [[joke]] "''I went to a fight and a hockey game broke out''".

Despite its potentially negative consequences, some consider fighting skill as a measure of all-around hockey talent. Often a player who has made a [[Gordie Howe hat trick]] is praised for the rare combination of physical intensity and hockey talent.

== The enforcer in hockey ==
{{mainarticle|Enforcer (hockey)}}
In hockey, some players have the job of taking down the opposition by any means necessary (mainly by big hits or fighting). Such a player is sometimes referred to as an enforcer, among less flattering epithets. These enforcers -- especially in recent decades -- are typically marginal players who generally see limited time on the ice, often on the fourth line. They are often sent out after a "scrum" or after a star player has been [[checking (hockey)|checked]] particularly hard. Often both teams will put out an enforcer or tough guy at the same time.

The enforcer's role is generally to engage the offending opponent in (or provoke one into) a fight. Essentially a tactic of intimidation, it keeps particularly dirty teams in check by enacting direct consequences on an offending player. Another common application is to goad a star into a fight, so as to take a skilled player off the ice at the cost of a marginal one.  Thus, star players are often discouraged from fighting (with exceptions over the years such as [[Gordie Howe]], [[Denis Potvin]], and [[Jarome Iginla]]), in addition to the risk of injury such as broken hands.
