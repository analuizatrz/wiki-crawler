'''Ray Ellington''' (born '''Ray Brown''' [[March 17]] [[1916]], died [[February 28]] [[1985]]) was a popular [[England|English]] [[singer]], [[drummer]] and bandleader. He is best known for his appearances on ''[[The Goon Show]]'' from [[1951]] to [[1960]]. The Ray Ellington Quartet had a regular musical segment on the show, and Ellington also had a small speaking role in many episodes, often as a parodic [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|African]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] or [[Arab]] [[Tribal chief|chieftain]] (but also often, with no attempt to change his normal [[British African-Caribbean community|Black]] [[Accent (linguistics)|accent]], as a female [[secretary]] or a [[Scotland|Scotsman]]). 

Ellington specialised in [[jazz]] but experimented with many other genres throughout the show's history and his musical style was heavily influenced by the comedic jump blues of [[Louis Jordan]]. Ellington's band was one of the first in the UK to feature the stripped-back guitar/bass/drums/piano format that became the basis of [[rock'n'roll]], as well as being one of the first groups in Britain to prominently feature the [[electric guitar]]. They were also reputedly the very first jazz band in the UK to use an [[amplification|amplified]] bass.

Early in the show's run, there were many jokes linking Ellington to the [[Africa]]n nation of [[Ghana]], thus leading Ellington to say that he came from Ghana. In truth, Ellington was born to a [[Russia]]n Jewish mother and an [[African-American]] father in [[England]]{{fn|1}}.
