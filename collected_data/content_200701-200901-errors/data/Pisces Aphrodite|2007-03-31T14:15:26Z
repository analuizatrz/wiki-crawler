== Secret Moves ==
*Royal Demon Rose: Aphrodite uses red roses as a projectile. Upon being struck by the thorns on the roses or smelling their fragrance, they would poison Aphrodite's enemies until they slowly lost their 5 senses and fell into a sweet aroma of death. Aphrodite also mentioned that these roses were used for protecting palaces in ancient times (hence the name), and he has similarly laid the exit of his Temple with a garden of these.
*Piranha Rose: Aphrodite uses black roses as a projectile. Upon impact, it would break anything in its touch.
*Bloody Rose: Aphrodite uses a white rose as a projectile. It would strike at the opponent's chest, and drain all the blood from their heart. As the white rose draws blood, it eventually becomes red. This is Aphrodite's strongest attack.

==Personality==
Pope Ares once claimed that Aphrodite was the most beautiful among all the Saints. He was named after the [[Aphrodite|Greek Goddess of love and beauty]] to reflect on this. However, Aphrodite, even so, never claimed to be the most beautiful creature, like the Silver Saint, Lacerta Misty who said that "even the stars in the sky will loose their luster compared to him." It is important to note that despite his feminine appearance, Aphrodite is not narcissistic. He is often seen as cruel as his fellow Gold Saint, [[Cancer Deathmask]], but not as sadistic.

==The Sanctuary saga==
As guardian of the final Temple of Sanctuary, Pisces Aphrodite faces the last two Bronze Saints remaining: [[Pegasus Seiya]] and [[Andromeda Shun]]. Shun stated that he would hold Aphrodite off, while Seiya manages to pass through the temple. Aphrodite laughs and tells Shun that even though Seiya passes through the temple, between it and the Pope's hall, he has a garden of Royal Demon Roses, and as Seiya has to pass through them, he would eventually lose his senses and die. As the two fought, Aphrodite revealed that he was the Gold Saint who attacked Andromeda Island and killed Shun's master, Cepheus Daidalos. Knowing about these facts, the normally kind and pacifist Shun was enraged, and vowed to defeat Aphrodite.

Using his '''Rolling Defence''', Shun managed to repell of all Aphrodite's '''Royal Demon Rose attack'''. However, when Aphrodite used his '''Pirahna Rose''' on Shun, his Nebula Chains and Bronze Cloth was shattered. Although he seemed to be defenseless, Shun remembered that his master, Cepheus Daidalos, mentioned that he had an extremely powerful cosmo in him, normally restrained by the Andromeda Cloth. This power could only be awakened when he is without his Cloth. Using the power of his hidden cosmos, Shun discovered a new attack: '''Nebula Storm''', which he used to pin down Aphrodite.  Being merciful in nature, Shun gave Aphrodite a chance to repent, but Aphrodite shows no intention to do so, and prepares his strongest attack, the '''Bloody Rose'''. Shun was forced to counter with his final attack "Nebula Storm" and ended up killing him, but not without being struck in the center of his heart by the Bloody Rose, falling into near-death conditions. The Bloody Rose was true to its name as it was sucking all the blood from Shun's heart. It was not until the start of the Asgard/Poseidon arc that he managed to recover.

== The Rose that touched Hades ==
[[Image:hades_pisces_face.jpg|thumb|250px|Given by Hades, new dark version of the Pisces Cloth]]
The deceased Gold Saints were revived as Spectres by the power of Hades, and, lead by the Spectre of former Pope, [[Aries Shion]], they were sent to Sanctuary to assassinate Athena. In the first Temple, Shion was stopped by [[Aries Mu]]. Shion orders [[Cancer Deathmask]] and [[Pisces Aphrodite]] to defeat Mu so they could continue their mission. However, neither Gold Saint was able to break Mu's Crystal Wall until Shion does so himself. Deathmasks beats Mu around for a moment until Seiya arrives and interferes, but Mu tells Seiya that he is not needed for this battle, and banishes him with his Starlight '''Extinction'''. Pleased with what Mu has done, Deathmask and Aphrodite attempts to pass the temple, but Mu tells them that he would kill any enemy who dares to cross the Aries Temple. Mu quickly banishes Deathmask and Aphrodite with his '''Starlight Extinction'''.

Back in Hades' castle, Wyvern Rhadamanthys, one of the 3 Judges of Hell, punishes the two for failing their mission, and casts them back into the abyss to hell.

Later on, it was revealed that Deathmask and Aphrodite were secretly on Athena's side, along with the rest of the deceased Gold Saints, and were asked by Shion to pretend to follow Hades' order (in the Anime, after Shion asked all the dead Gold and Silver Saints to pretend to follow Hades' order, Aphrodite smiled and Deathmask gave a smiley grin. Shion then thanked all of them for carrying the burden of the traitor's branding in pretending to betray Athena).

In the final gathering of the 12 Gold Saints at the Wall of Sighs, Aphrodite's spirit and the Gold Cloth of Pisces appeared to help open the gateway to Elysion, where Hades' true body lies. After this, his spirit and cosmo disappeared, and all that was evident of him was the Pisces Gold Cloth which remained.

==Episode G==
[[Saint Seiya Episode G]] show us Aphrodite seven years before the original happenings of the story. Already a Gold Saint, Aphrodite is depicted as a centered and merciless person able to kill his opponents even if they are humans. Aphrodite is also depicted as thinking about beautiful in fights and calling the victory the greatest beauty that crowns the strongest warrior. His participation, until now, was very short. After the Titans gate being discovered on , he was sent by the Pope of the Sanctuary to cover the entry of the Chronos' Labyrinth with his deadly roses.

Since [[Leo Aiolia]] rushed into the Titans' world before, the Pope's plans were ruined. Even so, Aphrodite saved a defenseless Aiolia from the attacks of the Titans' followers. After some argue between the two Gold Saints (since Aiolia was against Aphrodite bloodlust), the Gigas Anthrakma Zugilos appeared. Aphrodite saved himself and Aiolia from Zugilos' deadly mace (that could destroy anything alive with its vibrations) and then killed the Gigas. After that, he traveled back to the Sanctuary and left behind a carpet of vines and white roses protecting the exit of that world (to avoid an invasion against the Sanctuary).

In Episode G, Aphrodite is shown as a narcissistic person. This could be explained due to the fact he is seven years younger than in the original timeline.

== Pisces Albafica ==

[[Saint Seiya#Saint_Seiya_-_The_Lost_Canvas|The Lost Canvas manga]] status as canon is unknown. 

:Note: there is not an official transliteration of the Saint's name. Albafica is a fan-transliteration based on the katakana, but it may differ from the official spelling, that hasn't been announced yet other than in katakana.
The name '''Albafica''' come from the Greek word, ''Alba'', that means "white", and ''Ficus'' the same as the plant, that has the meaning of a "group of plants".
===Secret Moves===
*Royal Demon Rose
*Piranhian Rose
*Bloody Rose
**All the attacks are the same as Aphrodite's, though Albafica's Royal Demon Roses aren't painless.
*Crimson Thorn: This attack is first seen in the Lost Canvas chapter featuring the fight between Albafica and Deep Niobe. The attack generates a rose-shaped cloud from Albafica's own poisonous blood and unleashes a deadly rain that cuts through the enemy.

== Trivia ==
[[Image:aphrodite_epiG.jpg|thumb|250px|In Episode G, Aphrodite is shown controlling vines.]]
*Aside from using roses as his weapons, as shown in Episode G, Aphrodite also can create and freely control vines of climbers. The vines, which can be immense, can be used to constrain a victim, as whips, blades, etc. From the vines, Aphrodite can also bloom innumerable roses.<br>In The Lost Canvas Albafica is shown remote controlling and shooting roses, even out of sight.
*In most of the manga/anime and all of the movies they appeared in, Aphrodite and Deathmask were portrayed to be hopelessly evil Gold Saints. However, only on the OVA number 12 (Atena's Cloth) 25 (Goodbye Gold Saints), they are shown as redeemed characters who were once evil just as Gemini Saga was.
*Aphrodite has a [[beauty mark]], another reference to his famous beauty in Sanctuary. Albafica has not (he is a more malish character).
*Aphrodite was voiced by the same seiyuu as [[Zoisite (Sailor Moon)|Zoisite]] in [[Sailor Moon]], who has a similarly feminine and narcissistic personality.
*His name is probably a reference on the legend about the [[constellation]] of [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]]. In this legend [[Aphrodite]] and her son [[Eros]] transformed into fishes in order to escape the monstrous [[Typhon]].
