'''Dying Fetus''' is a [[death metal|Brutal]] [[deathgrind]] band formed in [[1991]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], [[United States]]. As of [[2006]], its line-up consists of John Gallagher (guitar, vocals), Mike Kimball (guitar), Sean Beasley (bass) and Duane Timlin (drums). Dying Fetus is often described as technical [[death metal]], and the band is renowned for its technical proficiency.

Dying Fetus's music is characterized by extremely fast [[blast beat]]s, complex [[riff|riffing]] and slow [[breakdown (-core)|breakdowns]]. The vocals range from very low [[death grunt|death growls]] to more abrasive upper-throat screams. Lyrics-wise, the band dabbled in the usual gory death metal subject matter on their early albums, but by 2000’s ''Destroy the Opposition,'' the band had practically completely shifted to political lyrics, mostly consisting of aggressive critique addressed towards things such as [[religion]], [[corporation]]s, [[consumerism]] and [[war]]. Following the release and tour of ''Destroy the Opposition'', in 2001, then-bassist/vocalist Jason Netherton and drummer [[Kevin Talley]] abandoned the band to form a new, more grindcore-influenced band, [[Misery Index (band)|Misery Index]]; they were later joined by another departing bandmate, Sparky Voyles. Without missing a beat, Gallagher recruited a completely new supporting line-up, which included Kimball, Beasely, and now-departed members Vince Matthews (vocals) and Erik Sayenga (drums), recording "Stop At Nothing," their only subsequent album after the split thus far.
