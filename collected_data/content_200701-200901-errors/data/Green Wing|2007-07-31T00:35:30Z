'''''Green Wing''''' is an award-winning [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television]] [[comedy]] set in a [[hospital]]. It was created by the same team behind the [[Sketch comedy|sketch]] show ''[[Smack the Pony]]''.

Although set in [[East Hampton Hospital Trust]], there are few medical storylines; most of the action is generated by a series of [[soap opera]] and [[Commedia dell'arte]]-style twists and turns in the personal lives of the characters. They proceed through a series of often absurd sketch-like scenes connected by [[lazzi]], or by sequences where the film is slowed down or sped up, often emphasising the [[body language]] of the characters. The show has eight writers. Two series were made by [[talkbackTHAMES]] [[Film production|production]] company for [[Channel 4]]. At sixty minutes including advertisement time, the episodes are twice as long as is usual for a British comedy series.

The series ran between [[September 3]] [[2004]] and [[19 May]] [[2006]]. A special episode was filmed with the second series, which was shown as a 90 minute long special on [[4 January]] [[2007]] in the UK, but was shown in Australia and Belgium on [[29 December]] [[2006]].<ref name="BSG news">{{cite web|last=Boosey |first=Mark |title=Green Wing News |publisher=British Sitcom Guide|url=http://www.sitcom.co.uk/green_wing/news.shtml|date=22th January 2007|accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref>

Separate from the series, a special sketch was made for [[Comic Relief]] and screened on [[11 March]] [[2005]]. Another was performed live at [[The Secret Policeman's Ball (2006)|The Secret Policeman's Ball]] on [[14 October]] [[2006]]. Episodes are currently being repeated in the UK on Sundays on [[More4]] and can be rented from [[4 on Demand]].

== Plot ==

[[Image:Green Wing Poster.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The main characters in ''Green Wing''. From left to right, Alan (Heap), Joanna (Haywood), Angela (Alexander), Caroline (Greig), Martin (Theobald), Guy (Mangan), Mac (Rhind-Tutt), Sue (Gomez) and Boyce (Chris).]]

[[Image:Green Wing - Office Girls.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The minor characters in ''Green Wing''. From left to right, Kim (Bretton), Rachel (Lyons), Harriet (Colman) and Karen (Raikes).]]

[[Caroline Todd (Television character)|Dr. Caroline Todd]] ([[Tamsin Greig]]) is a surgical [[Specialist registrar|registrar]] and the newest member of staff at the [[East Hampton Hospital Trust]], a seemingly normal [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospital, but with staff ranging from the slightly unusual to the completely bizarre. Caroline suffers from constant embarrassment, stumbling from one crisis to the next, mainly in the company of fellow doctors [[Guy Secretan]] ([[Stephen Mangan]]) and [[Mac (Green Wing)|Dr. "Mac" Macartney]] ([[Julian Rhind-Tutt]]).

Guy is a half-Swiss, womanising [[anaesthetist]] who has slept with most of the women in the hospital. The only thing he likes as much as himself is probably [[Guyball]], a sport he invented during his troubled years at public school.<ref name="S1E7">{{cite episode | title =  Lodgers  | series = Green Wing | serieslink =  Green Wing (series 1) | airdate = 2004-09-17 | season = 1 | number = 3}}</ref> Mac is the effortlessly cool, charming surgeon, and is rather laid-back, probably explaining why he has never been made a [[Consultant (medicine)|consultant]]. He was once in a relationship with another doctor, Holly Hawkes, but after six years they broke up due to her having an abortion which he did not approve of.<ref name="S1E3">{{cite episode | title =  Tangled Webs  | series = Green Wing | serieslink =  Green Wing (series 1) | airdate = 2004-10-15 | season = 1 | number = 3}}</ref> Guy and Mac have a long rivalry, and often play odd games and make stupid bets in order to see who is best. During her time at the hospital, it becomes clear that Caroline may have feelings for them, but she is unsure as to which one.

Other people Caroline meets include [[Martin Dear]] ([[Karl Theobald]]), a well-meaning [[Senior house officer|house officer]] who is constantly failing his exams. He is unloved by his mother and often faces bullying from Guy. Martin soon forms feelings for Caroline, and even starts to fall in love with her. Another member of staff is [[Angela Hunter]] ([[Sarah Alexander]]), a seemingly perfect and rather irritating senior registrar in paediatrics. Whilst Angela appears to mean well, Caroline cannot stand her, and despite her best efforts to avoid her, she ends up as Caroline's lodger.<ref name="S1E3"/>

Elsewhere in the hospital is [[Joanna Clore]] ([[Pippa Haywood]]), the 48-year-old head of [[human resources]] with an increasingly bitter attitude, especially towards the younger members of her staff. These include [[Harriet Schulenburg]] ([[Olivia Colman]]), an overworked mother of four trapped in an unhappy marriage; [[Kim Alabaster]] ([[Sally Bretton]]), who has a bad attitude towards most people; [[Naughty Rachel]] ([[Katie Lyons]]), who earned her nickname due to her perverted nature; and [[Karen Ball]] ([[Lucinda Raikes]]), the only member of staff who does any work, and suffers bullying from Kim and Rachel because of it. She is a [[secret admirer]] of Martin.<ref name="S1E5">{{cite episode | title =  Housewarming Party | series = Green Wing | serieslink =  Green Wing (series 1) | airdate = 2004-10-01 | season = 1 | number = 5}}</ref>

Joanna's main form of excitement is usually in the form of [[Alan Statham]] ([[Mark Heap]]), a pompous, stuttering, kinky and extremely odd [[consultant]] [[radiologist]]. Alan and Joanna try their best to keep their relationship secret, despite the fact that everyone in the hospital knows about it. The one person most aware is [[Boyce (Green Wing)|Boyce]] ([[Oliver Chris]]), a junior house officer who spends most of his time trying to make Alan's life a living hell, rather than studying. Apart from Boyce, Alan is hated by most of the staff at the hospital, including Mac. Boyce spends most of his time with Martin and Kim.

Scottish staff liaison officer [[Sue White]] ([[Michelle Gomez]]) is hired to hear the staff's problems. However, Sue is probably the least suited person for the job. She is – perhaps surprisingly, considering how much competition she has – the most eccentric member of staff there, quite apart from being rude, cruel, foul-mouthed and, seemingly, a [[sociopath]]. Her office is a place where the impossible tends to happen, and anyone who enters it is normally treated with a mixture of verbal abuse and mental torture. The only person she treats with any affection is Mac, whom she loves to the point of madness, but Mac, like everyone else in the hospital, sees her as bordering on the edge of insanity. Anyone else who attempts to get involved with Mac is normally treated with hate by Sue.

== Production ==
=== Writers and crew ===

[[Image:East Hampton Logo - Green Wing.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The [[East Hampton Hospital Trust]] logo.]]

''Green Wing'' was created and devised by [[Victoria Pile]], who is also the [[casting director]], one of the writers and the [[Television producer|producer]] (with [[Peter Fincham (producer)|Peter Fincham]] as [[executive producer]]). Pile is involved in the editing, filming and [[post-production]].

Pile describes ''Green Wing'' as being a continuation of her previous show, ''[[Smack the Pony]]'', and as "a sketch-meets-comedy-drama-meets-soap".<ref name="Pileinter">{{cite web |title=Victoria Pile Interview |publisher=Channel 4 |url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greenwing/victoria.html |accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref> Most of the people involved in ''Green Wing'' worked on ''Smack the Pony''. The show has eight writers: Pile, [[Robert Harley (writer)|Robert Harley]], [[Gary Howe]], [[Stuart Kenworthy]], [[Oriane Messina]], [[Richard Preddy]], [[Fay Rusling]] and [[James Henry (writer)|James Henry]]. This is unusual for a British sitcom, which normally have only one or two writers.

The show is directed by [[Tristram Shapeero]] and [[Dominic Brigstocke]]. Along with Pile, they contribute to editing ''Green Wing''. Sketches are sped up or slowed down to create comic effect,<ref>Lewisohn, Mark. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/g/greenwing_999041229.shtml Comedy Guide - Green Wing] [[BBC]].co.uk. Accessed [[2007-06-26]].</ref> often using body language to create humour. Editing is also used due to the amount of [[corpsing]] (breaking character) that occurs during the filming of the show. Tamsin Greig is said to corpse frequently.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tamsin Greig Interview |publisher=Channel 4 |url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greenwing/tamsin2.html |accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref> The other notable member of the crew is [[Jonathan Whitehead]], who wrote the music for the show (under the name [[Trellis]]), which plays prominently in the show. His work won him an RTS Craft & Design Award (See [[Green Wing#Awards|Awards]]).

=== Production ===

''Green Wing's'' title is said to have come from a small plastic green man with wings that was in [[executive producer]] [[Peter Fincham (producer)|Peter Fincham's]] top pocket, and fell on Pile's desk. Fincham claimed it was not his, so Pile kept it.<ref name="ser1commep1">''Green Wing'' Series 1 DVD, Audio  Commentary, Episode 1. Featuring Victoria Pile, Billy Sneddon, Dominic Brigstocke and Stephen Mangan.</ref> This plastic man appears at the end of the credits on every show.

Originally, the show had a half-hour pilot made a year before transmission that was never aired. Scenes from the pilot can easily be spotted in the first episode, "Caroline's First Day," due to the characters' appearance, most notably Stephen Mangan's and Julian Rhind-Tutt's haircuts. The pilot allowed the writers to experiment, such as using different filming techniques.<ref name="ser1commep1"/> In the pilot, [[Doon Mackichan]] played Joanna Clore and was meant to play her in the original series, but left because she had a baby.<ref name="BSG news"/>

Although each script is fully written, the actors are allowed to improvise their own jokes, frequently adding to what has already been written. Normally [[workshop]]s are used to allow actors to improvise their own material.<ref>''Green Wing'' Series 1 DVD, Behind The Scenes featurette.</ref> One example of improvised material was Stephen Mangan's idea of Guy falling in love with Caroline. Rusling, Howe, Messina and Harley all have had speaking parts in the show, most notably Harley playing Charles Robertson, the hospital's CEO. The show's crew often make appearances in the show as extras. Nearly everyone involved makes a small appearance. For example, Pile's former assistant Phil Secretan (whom Guy is named after) appears at the end of a scene in the first episode.<ref name="ser1commep1"/> Henry appears in the background during Martin's exam in the episode, "Tests".

Most of the filming was done at two hospitals, the [[Northwick Park Hospital]] in [[Middlesex]] and the [[North Hampshire Hospital]] in [[Basingstoke]]. This presented a problem because the show had to work around the real-life hospital, with its actual doctors, patients and emergency situations. In one scene in the final episode in series one, Guy (Mangan) was hitting [[squash (sport)|squash balls]] behind him, and nearly hit a patient.<ref name="ser1commep1"/> However, some scenes, such as those in Sue's and Alan's offices, were filmed in a studio.<ref>''Green Wing'' Series 1 DVD, Audio Commentary, Episode 2. Featuring Stephen Mangan, Julian Rhind-Tutt, Dominic Brigstocke, Caroline Pitcher (Costume Designer), Jane Batt (Wardrobe Supervisor) Judith Barkas (Hair and Make-Up) and Billy Sneddon</ref>

=== Unused storylines ===

Like many shows, ''Green Wing'' did have some plotlines that were never used, and some scenes that were cut from the show. Unused storylines included Alan having an eighty-year-old wife and grandchildren as old as him, and Guy suffering from [[impotence]].<ref>''Green Wing'' Series 1 DVD, Audio Commentary, Episode 9. Featuring Tristram Shapeero, Jonathan Paul Green (Production Designer), Fay Rusling, Oriane Messina, Stephen Mangan and Julian Rhind-Tutt.</ref> Pile originally wanted the show to cover the entire hospital, not just doctors, but also porters, car park attendants and kitchen staff as well. However, she eventually decided that they had enough material with the eight main doctors and human resources workers.<ref name="Pileinter"/>

Two endings were created for the special. The [[Alternate ending|alternative ending]] is included on the DVD, along with deleted scenes from the episode. <ref name="BSG buy">{{cite web|last=Boosey |first=Mark |title=Green Wing Merchandise |publisher=British Sitcom Guide|url=http://www.sitcom.co.uk/green_wing/buy.shtml |date=22th January 2007|accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref> The alternative ending was planned to be used if the third series was going to be commissioned, as this ending was much more ambiguous. It is known that the actors wanted the alternative ending, but after some debate, it was not shown.<ref name="BSG news"/>

Guy drives the ambulance to Wales, with Mac and the paralysed Martin with him. Whilst Mac tries to phone the police, Guy drives into a field and almost goes over a cliff.

After the death of a patient who offers them wise advice, Guy, Mac and Martin all decide to propose to Caroline.

Caroline then accepts Guy's proposal of marriage. Meanwhile in the HR department, Karen is sitting on a windowsill, due to her fear of [[The Clangers|clangers]]. Whilst sitting there, Rachel opens the window behind her, and causes Karen to fall out. However, no one seems to notice.<ref name="S2E8"/>

The police arrive at the hospital. Alan and Joanna believe that they will be arrested, and with Boyce's help escape from the hospital.

===Secret Policeman's Ball sketch (2006)===

A sketch was performed for [[Amnesty International|Amnesty International's]] [[The Secret Policeman's Ball (2006)|Secret Policeman's Ball]], with performances from Tamsin Greig, Stephen Mangan, Julian Rhind-Tutt and Michelle Gomez.

When the announcer at the ball asks if there is there a doctor in the house, Mac puts his hand up, to Caroline's embarrassment. Things get more embarrassing when Guy also volunteers, and asks why Caroline is sitting next to Mac when she is Guy's fiancée. Things become even more bizarre when Sue appears in a tutu and a pair of very long arms, trying to protect Mac from stalkers.<ref name="Secret"/>

=== Special ===

{{main|Green Wing Special}}

The episode begins with the funeral of Angela, who departed the show during the second series, after being killed by a moose, according to Guy. Mac, after a month's leave, discovers what has happened between Caroline and Guy, and although hurt, makes no attempt to interfere. Guy, upon learning of Mac's terminal illness, tells Caroline to marry Mac instead of him.<ref name="Special">{{cite episode | title = Special | series = Green Wing | serieslink =  Green Wing Special | airdate = 2007-01-04 | season =  | number = }}</ref>

Meanwhile Alan and Joanna are still on the run, rescued by Martin who calls the AA. Whilst on their journey, they continue to accidentally kill more people, including a shop assistant whom Alan "sat on to death". Boyce ends up missing Alan, after his replacement turns out to be even more horrible than Alan. Soon, they decide that, with no transport, money or employment, the only option is suicide. They are last seen, naked, walking hand-in-hand towards the sea.<ref name="Special"/> Meanwhile, Karen returns to work after her fall, but has changed drastically. She has become more confident, has developed better dress sense, but has lost her right hand and her nose whistles whenever she has an orgasm. With Joanna gone, the office girls start to run riot, forming their own tribe and becoming hostile to anyone who enters the department.<ref name="Special"/>

Mac and Caroline finally marry, despite Mac's terminal illness (the exact nature of the illness is never disclosed, although Mac does tell Guy that its name has an "a" and an "e" in it). Sue gets over her obsession with Mac, and finds love with a new man, who reciprocates her feelings. The episode concludes with Caroline being carried into the air by a bunch of helium filled balloons at the wedding reception, although on the DVD boxset extras it shows a alternate ending where Guy and Mac grab onto Caroline's ankles and are taken to the sky with her, this alternate ending ends with Mac saying "Caroline I think I have something to tell you"<ref name="Special"/>

== Signature jokes ==
''Green Wing'' has a lot of jokes that constantly run through the programme; the most famous is [[Guyball]], a sport invented by Guy when he was at public school, with somewhat confusing rules. The basic object of the game is to throw a ball into a "Topmiler", a basket attached to a helmet. This game was even played at the ''Wingin' It Green Wing'' Convention.<ref name="Convention">Nixon, Terri, (22th January 2007) [http://www.sitcom.co.uk/green_wing/convention.shtml Green Wing Convention]. British Sitcom Guide. Accessed [[17 June]], [[2007]].</ref>

''Green Wing'' includes a large amount of jokes about hair. One of the most famous was the character Karen getting her hair trapped in a printer in the very first episode.<ref name="S1E1"/> Other recurring jokes include Boyce's practical jokes, the bizarre games played by the human resources staff, and the operation scenes with Caroline, Guy and Mac, in which they avoid doing the actual operation.<ref name="S1E7"/>

==Critical reaction==

The show received mixed reviews. Many people consider it to be original and funny. The ''[[Evening Standard]]'' said that it was "a comedy as physically adroit as it was verbally sharp," and ''[[The Guardian]]'' said that "Channel 4’s hospital sitcom is the most innovative comedy since, well, ''[[The Office]]''."<ref> ''Green Wing – The Complete First Series DVD'' realised 4 April 2006.</ref>

Critics of ''Green Wing'' attack its seemingly random and meaningless comedy, the [[lazzi]] methods of filming, and the overall length of the episodes, claiming that hour-long episodes are too long. The show won the 2005<ref>[http://chilled.cream.org/tumbleweed2005/tumbleweeds_results.html Comedy Tumbleweed Awards 2005]. ''Tumbleweed.''

The cast, crew and writers of ''Green Wing'' have shown no interest in creating a third series because of scheduling difficulties due to new projects being undertaken by the creators and talkbackTHAMES not having a big enough budget. However, creator Victoria Pile mentioned in an interview in the ''[[Radio Times]]'' that she may do a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]], saying, "I'm hoping to do another Channel 4 comedy imminently, possibly starring some of the same cast. Hopefully, it will be some kind of spin-off from ''Green Wing''."<ref name="BSG news"/> Since then, it has not only been accepted that Pile is creating a spin-off, but also that Channel 4 will probably accept it. However, details are not known. During the special appearance at the [[British Film Institute|BFI]], "When asked about a rumoured spinoff at the BFI event Victoria Pile seemed to glance in the direction of JRT, TG and SM before dodging the question."<ref name="BSG news"/> However, Pile and some other writers have successfully written a new half-hour sitcom pilot for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], set in a police precinct in America. This is something of an unusual move as this show is marketed for the Americans first rather than the British.<ref name="BSG news"/>

== Impact ==
Between the end of series 2 and the broadcast of the special episode, ''Green Wing'' fans formed two camps as to how they wanted ''Green Wing'' to end, in terms of who Caroline fell in love with. One camp, the ''Caromacs'' wanted Caroline to end up with Mac. The other camp, who wanted Caroline to stay with Guy, are referred to as ''Caroguys''.<ref>[http://www.sitcom.co.uk/green_wing/poll.php British Sitcom Guide, Green Wing Poll] Written by Mark Boosey, [[23 January]], [[2007]].
