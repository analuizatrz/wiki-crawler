Captain '''Cowper Phipps Coles''', C.B., R.N. ([[1819]] - [[7 September]] [[1870]]), the son of the Reverend John Coles and his wife Mary Ann Goodhew Rogers, was an [[England|English]] [[naval captain]] and [[inventor]].

He entered the [[Royal Navy]] at the age of eleven. Coles distinguished himself at the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854)|siege of Sevastopol']] during the 1850s in the [[Crimean War]] against [[Russia]]. It was at this time that he and other British naval officers and sailors constructed a raft named the ''Lady Nancy'' which sported a rotating protective turret. After the war, Coles patented his design for a rotating turret.

His revolutionary turret design got the ball rolling for the British Navy to begin looking at ways to adopt it. Several early naval vessels, such as ''Prince Albert'' and ''Royal Sovereign'', were constructed or modified and incorporated Coles designs. He pressed, however, for the British Admiralty to allow him to build a low-freeboard turret warship and in [[1866]] the British Navy finally agreed.

Coles became the lead designer for [[HMS Captain (1869)|HMS ''Captain'']]. The ship used most of Coles' design. However, extensive rigging was necessary to make the ship ocean-going. This forced the creation of a "hurricane deck" above the turrets, which raised the center of gravity of the vessel. That was one of the key reasons why ''Captain'' [[capsize|capsized]] on the night of [[6 September]] [[1870]], which took Coles' life.

In [[1856]], Coles married Emily Pearson, niece of [[Edmund Lyons|Admiral Lord Lyons]]. Coles was himself a nephew, by marriage, of Admiral Lord Lyons, his mother being the sister of Augusta, Lyons' wife.
