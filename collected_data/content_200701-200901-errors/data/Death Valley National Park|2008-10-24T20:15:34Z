'''Death Valley National Park''' is a mostly [[arid]] [[United States National Park]] located east of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain range in southern [[Inyo County, California|Inyo County]] and northern [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]] in [[California]], with a small extension into southwestern [[Nye County, Nevada|Nye County]] and extreme southern [[Esmeralda County, Nevada|Esmeralda County]] in [[Nevada]]. In addition, there is an [[exclave]] ([[Devil's Hole]]) in southern Nye County. The park covers {{convert|5262|sqmi|km2}}, encompassing [[Saline Valley, California|Saline Valley]], a large part of [[Panamint Valley]], almost all of [[Death Valley]], and parts of several [[mountain range]]s.<ref name="NPSindex">[[#NPSindex|National Park Index (2001–2003)]], p. 26</ref> '''Death Valley National Monument''' was proclaimed in 1933, placing the area under federal protection. In 1994, the [[U.S. National Monument|monument]] was redesignated a national park, as well as being substantially expanded to include [[Saline Valley, California|Saline]] and [[Eureka Valley, Inyo County|Eureka]] Valleys.<ref name="NPSindex"/>

It is the hottest and driest of the national parks in the United States. It also features the second-lowest point in the [[Western Hemisphere]] and the lowest point in North America at [[Badwater]], which is {{convert|282|ft|m}} below [[sea level]]. It is home to many species of plants and animals that have adapted to this harsh [[desert]] environment. Some examples include [[Creosote Bush]], [[Bighorn Sheep]], [[Coyote]], and the [[Death Valley Pupfish]], a survivor of much wetter times. Approximately 95% of the park is designated as [[U.S. Wilderness Area|wilderness]].<ref>[[#NPSwebsite|NPS website]], "Backcountry Roads"</ref> Death Valley National Park is visited annually by more than 770,000 visitors who come to enjoy its diverse geologic features, desert wildlife, historic sites, scenery, clear night skies and the solitude of the extreme desert environment.<ref name="NPSguide"/>

[[Mining]] was the primary activity in the area before it was protected. The first known non-[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s to enter Death Valley did so in the winter of 1849, thinking they would save time by taking a shortcut to the [[California Gold Rush|gold fields of California]]. They were stuck for weeks and in the process gave the Valley its name, even though only one of their group died there. Several short-lived [[boom town]]s sprang up during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to exploit minor local bonanzas of gold. The only long-term profitable [[ore]] to be mined, however, was [[borax]], a mineral used to make soap and an important industrial [[compound (chemistry)|compound]]. [[20-Mule Teams|Twenty-mule teams]] were famously used to transport ore out of the Valley, helping to make it famous and the subject of books, radio programs, television series, and movies.

The natural environment of the area has been profoundly shaped by its geology. The oldest [[rock (geology)|rock]]s are extensively [[Metamorphism|metamorphosed]] and at least 1.7&nbsp;billion years old.<ref name="Wright1997p611"/> Ancient warm, shallow seas deposited marine sediments until [[rift]]ing opened the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Additional sedimentation occurred until a [[subduction zone]] formed off the coast. This uplifted the region out of the sea and created a line of [[volcano]]es. Later the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] started to pull apart, creating the current [[Basin and Range]] landform. Valleys filled with sediment and, during the wet times of [[ice age]]s, with lakes, such as [[Lake Manly]].

==Geographic setting==
Within the park there are two major valleys: [[Death Valley]] and [[Panamint Valley]], both of which were formed within the last few million years and both bounded by north–south-trending [[mountain range]]s.<ref name="Sharp1997p1"/> These and adjacent valleys follow the general trend of [[Basin and Range]] topography with one modification: there are parallel [[strike-slip fault]]s that perpendicularly bound the central extent of Death Valley. The result of this shearing action is additional extension in the central part of Death Valley which causes a slight widening and relatively more subsidence there.

[[Image:Death Valley,19820817,Desert,radiator water tank.jpg|thumbnail|left|Desert and abandoned radiator water tank near Grapevine]]
Uplift of surrounding mountain ranges and subsidence of the valley floor are both occurring. The uplift on the Black Mountains is so fast that the [[alluvial fan]]s (fan-shaped deposits at the mouth of canyons) there are relatively small and steep compared to the huge alluvial fans coming off the [[Panamint Range]]. In many places so-called "wine glass canyons" are formed along the Black Mountains front as a result. This type of canyon results from the mountain range's relatively fast uplift which does not allow the canyons enough time to cut a classic V-shape all the way down to the stream bed. Instead a V-shape ends at a slot canyon halfway down with a relatively small and steep alluvial fan on which the stream sediments collect.

At {{convert|282|ft|m}} below [[sea level]],<ref name="Wright1997p611"/> Badwater on Death Valley's floor is the second-lowest point in the Western Hemisphere (behind [[Laguna del Carbón]] in [[Argentina]]), while [[Mount Whitney]], only {{convert|85|mi|km}} to the west, rises to {{convert|14505|ft|m}}.<ref name="Sharp1997p1">{{harvnb|Sharp|1997|p=1}}</ref> This topographic relief is the greatest elevation gradient in the [[Continental United States|contiguous United States]] and is the terminus point of the [[Great Basin]]'s southwestern drainage.<ref name="Wright1997p611"/> Although the extreme lack of water in the Great Basin makes this distinction of little current practical use, it does mean that in wetter times the lake that once filled Death Valley ([[Lake Manly]]) was the last stop for water flowing in the region, meaning the water there was relatively saturated in dissolved materials. Thus the [[Salt pan (geology)|salt pan]]s in Death Valley are among the largest in the world and are rich in minerals, such as [[borax]] and various [[salt]]s and [[hydrate]]s.<ref name="Wright1997p625">{{harvnb|Wright and Miller|1997|p=625}}</ref> The largest salt pan in the park extends {{convert|40|mi|km}} from the Ashford Mill Site to the Salt Creek Hills, covering some {{convert|200|sqmi|km2}} of the Valley floor.<ref name="Wright1997p625"/><ref group=note>Badwater, the Devils Golf Course, and Salt Creek are all part of the Death Valley Saltpan.</ref> The second-best known [[playa]] in the park is the [[Racetrack Playa|Racetrack]], famous for its moving rocks.

==Climate==

Death Valley is one of the hottest and driest places in North America due to its lack of surface water and its low relief. On July 10, 1913, a record {{convert|134|°F|°C|1}} was measured at the [[Weather Bureau]]'s observation station at Greenland Ranch (now the site for the Furnace Creek Inn), the highest temperature ever recorded on that [[continent]] as of 2007.<ref name="NPSweather">[[#NPSwebsite|NPS website]], "Weather and Climate"</ref> Daily summer temperatures of {{convert|120|°F|°C}} or greater are common, as well as below freezing nightly temperatures in the winter.<ref name="Wright1997p611">{{harvnb|Wright and Miller|1997|p=611}}</ref> July is the hottest month, with an average high of {{convert|115|°F|°C}} and an average low of {{convert|88|°F|°C}}.<ref name="USGSweather">[[#USGSweather|USGS weather]]</ref> December is the coldest month, with an average high of {{convert|65|°F|°C}} and an average low of {{convert|39|°F|°C}}.<ref name="USGSweather"/> The record low is {{convert|15|°F|°C|1}}.<ref name="USGSweather"/> <!-- NEEDS CITE There are an average of 189.3 days annually with highs of {{convert|90|°F|°C|1}} or higher and 138 days annually with highs of {{convert|100|°F |°C|1}} or higher. Freezing temperatures of {{convert|32|°F|°C}} or lower occur on an average of 11.7 days annually. /NEEDS CITE -->

[[Image:DevaxsectSM.svg|right|thumb|290px|A slice through the highest and lowest points in Death Valley National Park]]
Several of the larger Death Valley springs derive their water from a regional [[aquifer]], which extends as far east as southern [[Nevada]] and [[Utah]]. Much of the water in this aquifer has been there for many thousands of years, since the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice age]]s, when the [[climate]] was cooler and wetter. Today's drier climate does not provide enough precipitation to recharge the aquifer at the rate at which water is being withdrawn.<ref name="FocusWater">{{harvnb|USGS|2004|p="Furnace Creek"}}</ref>

The highest range in the park is the Panamint Range with [[Telescope Peak]] being its highest point at {{convert|11049|ft|m}}.<ref name="Wright1997p611"/> The Death Valley region is a transitional zone in the northernmost part of the [[Mojave Desert]] and consists of five mountain ranges removed from the Pacific Ocean. Three of these are significant barriers: the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], the [[Argus Range]], and the Panamint Range. Air masses tend to lose moisture as they are forced up over mountain ranges, in what climatologists call a [[rainshadow effect]].

[[Image:Death Valley,19820817,Dante's View,Salt shoreline closeup o.jpg|thumbnail|left|Salt shoreline has remodeled the landscape at [[Devil's Golf Course]], as seen from [[Dante's View]] ]]

The exaggerated rainshadow effect for the Death Valley area makes it [[North America|North America's]] driest spot, receiving about {{convert|1.5|in|mm}} of rainfall annually at Badwater (some years fail to register any measurable rainfall).<ref>{{harvnb|Wright and Miller|1997|pp=610–611}}</ref> Annual average precipitation varies from {{convert|1.92|in|mm|0}} overall below sea level to over {{convert|15|in|mm}} in the higher mountains that surround the Valley.<ref name="USGSweather"/> When rain does arrive it often does so in intense storms that cause [[flash flood]]s which remodel the landscape and sometimes create very shallow ephemeral lakes.

The hot, dry climate makes it difficult for soil to form. [[Mass wasting]], the down-slope movement of loose rock, is therefore the dominant erosive force in mountainous area, resulting in "skeletonized" ranges (literally, mountains with very little soil on them). [[Sand dune]]s in the park, while famous, are not nearly as numerous as their fame or the dryness of the area may suggest. One of the main dune fields is near Stovepipe Wells in the north-central part of the Valley and is primarily made of [[quartz]] sand. Another dune field is just {{convert|10|mi|km}} to the north but is instead mostly composed of [[travertine]] sand.<ref name="Kiver1999p2783">{{harvnb|Kiver|1999|p=283}}</ref> Yet another dune field is near the seldom-visited Ibex Hill in the southernmost part of the park, just south of the Saratoga Springs marshland. Prevailing winds in the winter come from the north, and prevailing winds in the summer come from the south. Thus the overall position of the dune fields remain more or less fixed.

==Human history==
===Early inhabitants and passers-through===
Four [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] cultures are known to have lived in the area during the last 10,000&nbsp;years or so.<ref name="Wright1997p611"/> The first known group, the [[Nevares Spring People]], were [[hunters and gatherers]] who arrived in the area perhaps 9,000&nbsp;years ago (7000&nbsp;[[Before Common Era|BCE]]) when there were still small lakes in Death Valley and neighboring Panamint Valley.<ref name="Wallace1978">{{harvnb|Wallace|1978}}</ref> A much milder climate persisted at that time, and large game animals were still plentiful. By 5,000&nbsp;years ago (3000&nbsp;BCE) the [[Mesquite Flat People]] displaced the Nevares Spring People.<ref name="Wallace1978"/> Around 2,000&nbsp;years ago the [[Saratoga Spring People]] moved into the area, which by then was probably already a hot, dry desert.<ref name="Wallace1978"/><ref group=note>The last known lake to exist in Death Valley likely dried up 3,000&nbsp;years ago.</ref> This culture was more advanced at hunting and gathering and was skillful at handcrafts. They also left mysterious stone patterns in the Valley. 

[[Image:Petroglyphs2-above Mesquite Springs-800px.JPG|thumb|left|[[Petroglyph]]s above Mesquite Springs]]
A thousand years ago the nomadic [[Timbisha]] (formerly called "Shoshone" and also known as "Panamint" or "Koso") moved into the area and hunted game and gathered [[mesquite]] beans along with [[pinyon pine]] nuts.<ref name="Wallace1978"/><ref name="Wright1997p611"/> Because of the wide altitude differential between the valley bottom and the mountain ridges, especially on the west, the Timbisha practiced a vertical migration pattern.<ref name="Wright1997p611"/> Their winter camps were located near water sources in the valley bottoms. As the spring and summer progressed and the weather warmed, grasses and other plant food sources ripened at progressively higher altitudes. November found them at the very top of the mountain ridges where they harvested pine nuts before moving back to the valley bottom for winter. <!-- NEEDS CITE Several families of Timbisha still live within the Park at [[Furnace Creek, California|Furnace Creek]] (Timbisha is the Native name of the village). The former village of Maahunu is located near [[Scotty's Castle]] but has been abandoned. Many of the baskets on display at the Castle were made by the Timbisha, who worked there as laborers and housekeepers before the National Park Service took over its care. /NEEDS CITE -->

The [[California Gold Rush]] brought the first people of European descent known to visit the immediate area. In December 1849 two groups of [[California Gold Country]]-bound white travelers with perhaps 100 wagons total stumbled into Death Valley after getting lost on what they thought was a shortcut off the [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]].<ref name="Kiver1999p277">{{harvnb|Kiver|1999|p=277}}</ref> Called the [[Death Valley '49ers|Bennett-Arcane Party]], they were unable to find a pass out of the valley for weeks; they were able to find fresh water at various springs in the area, but were forced to eat several of their oxen to survive. They used the wood of their wagons to cook the meat and make jerky. The place where they did this is today referred to as "Burned Wagons Camp" and is located near the sand dunes.

After abandoning their wagons, they eventually were able to hike out of the valley. Just after leaving the valley, one of the women in the group turned and said, "Goodbye Death Valley," giving the valley they endured its name.<ref name="Kiver1999p277"/><ref group=note>In fact only one member of the Death Valley '49ers died in Death Valley, an elderly man named Culverwell, who was half dead already when he entered it.</ref> Included in the party was [[William L. Manly|William Lewis Manly]] whose autobiographical book ''[[Death Valley in '49]]'' detailed this trek and popularized the area (geologists later named the prehistoric lake that once filled the valley after him).

===Boom and bust===

[[Image:1993 death valley furnace creek museum.jpg‎|thumb|Historical locomotive for Borax-carrying in the Death Valley (Furnace-Creek-Museum), USA, in June 1993]]
The ores that are most famously associated with the area were also the easiest to collect and the most profitable: evaporite deposits such as salts, [[borate]], and [[talc]]. Borax was found by Rosie and Aaron Winters near [[Furnace Creek Inn and Ranch Resort|Furnace Creek Ranch]] (then called Greenland) in 1881.<ref name="HarmonyBorax">{{harvnb|USGS|2004|p="Harmony Borax Works"}}</ref>  Later that same year, the [[Eagle Borax Works]] became Death Valley's first commercial borax operation. [[William Tell Coleman]] built the [[Harmony Borax Works]] plant and began to process ore in late 1883 or early 1884, continuing until 1888.<ref name="NPSmining">[[#NPSwebsite|NPS website]], "Mining"</ref> This mining and smelting company produced borax to make [[soap]] and for industrial uses.<ref name="NPS20mule">[[#NPSwebsite|NPS website]], "Twenty Mule Teams"</ref> The end product was shipped out of the valley 165&nbsp;miles (265&nbsp;km) to the [[Mojave, California|Mojave]] railhead in 10-ton-capacity wagons pulled by "[[twenty-mule team]]s" that were actually teams of 18 mules and 2 horses each.<ref name="NPS20mule"/> The teams averaged two miles (3&nbsp;km) an hour and required about 30&nbsp;days to complete a round trip.<ref name="HarmonyBorax"/> The trade name [[Twenty-Mule-Team Borax|''20-Mule Team Borax'']] was established by [[Francis Marion Smith]]'s [[Pacific Coast Borax Company]] after Smith acquired Coleman's borax holdings in 1890. A memorable advertising campaign used the wagon's image to promote the [[Boraxo]] brand of granular hand soap and the [[Death Valley Days]] radio and television programs. Mining continued after the collapse of Coleman's empire, and by the late 1920s the area was the world's number one source of borax.<ref name="Wright1997p611"/> Some four to six million years old, the Furnace Creek Formation is the primary source of borate minerals gathered from Death Valley's playas.<ref name="HarmonyBorax"/>

[[Image:Skidoo in 1906.jpg|thumb|left|Skidoo in 1906]]
Other visitors stayed to prospect for and mine deposits of [[copper]], [[gold]], [[lead]], and [[silver]].<ref name="Wright1997p611"/> These sporadic mining ventures were hampered by their remote location and the harsh desert environment. In December 1903, two men from Ballarat were prospecting for silver.<ref name="NPSpeople">[[#NPSwebsite|NPS website]], "People"</ref> One was an out-of-work Irish miner named Jack Keane and the other was a one-eyed Basque butcher named Domingo Etcharren. Quite by accident, Keane discovered an immense ledge of free-milling gold by the duo's work site and named the claim the [[Keane Wonder Mine]]. This started a minor and short-lived [[gold rush]] into the area.<ref name="NPSpeople"/> The Keane Wonder Mine, along with mines at [[Rhyolite, Nevada|Rhyolite]], [[Skidoo, California|Skidoo]] and [[Harrisburg, California|Harrisburg]], were the only ones to extract enough metal ore to make them worthwhile. Outright shams such as [[Leadfield, California|Leadfield]] also occurred, but most ventures quickly ended after a short series of prospecting mines failed to yield evidence of significant ore (these mines now dot the entire area and are a significant hazard to anyone who enters them). The boom towns which sprang up around these mines flourished during the first decade of the 20th century but soon declined after the [[Panic of 1907]].<ref name="NPSmining"/>

===Early tourism===
[[Image:Scotty's Castle under construction.JPG|thumb|Scotty's Castle under construction]]
The first documented tourist facilities in Death Valley were a set of tent houses built in the 1920s where Stovepipe Wells is now located. People flocked to resorts built around natural springs thought to have curative and restorative properties. In 1927, Pacific Coast Borax turned the crew quarters of its Furnace Creek Ranch into a resort, creating the [[The Furnace Creek Inn and Ranch Resort|Furnace Creek Inn]] and resort.<ref name="NPSinn">[[#NPSwebsite|NPS website]], "Furnace Creek Inn"</ref> The spring at Furnace Creek was harnessed to develop the resort, and as the water was diverted, the surrounding [[marsh]]es and [[wetland]]s started to shrink.<ref name="FocusWater"/> 

Soon the Valley was a popular winter destination. Other facilities started off as private getaways but were later opened to the public. Most notable among these was Death Valley Ranch, better known as [[Scotty's Castle]]. This large ranch home built in the [[Spanish Revival]] style became a hotel in the late 1930s and, largely due to the fame of [[Death Valley Scotty]], a tourist attraction. Death Valley Scotty, whose real name was Walter Scott, was a gold miner who pretended to be owner of "his castle", which he claimed to have built with profits from his gold mine. Neither claim was true, but the real owner, [[Chicago]] millionaire [[Albert Mussey Johnson]], encouraged the myth. When asked by reporters what his connection was to Walter Scott's castle, Johnson replied that he was Mr. Scott's banker.<ref>[[#NPSwebsite|NPS website]], "[http://www.nps.gov/deva/historyculture/scotty3.htm Johnson and Scotty Build a Castle]"</ref>

===Protection and later history===
[[Image:CCC boys in Death Valley.jpg|thumb|Civilian Conservation Corps workers in Death Valley]]

President [[Herbert Hoover]] proclaimed a [[U.S. National Monument|national monument]] in and around Death Valley on February 11, 1933, setting aside almost two million acres (8,000&nbsp;km²) of southeastern California and small parts of westernmost Nevada.<ref name="NPSguide">[[#NPSguide|NPS Visitor Guide]]</ref> Twelve companies worked in Death Valley using [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] workers during the [[Great Depression]] and on into the early 1940s. They built barracks, graded 500&nbsp;miles (800&nbsp;km) of roads, installed water and telephone lines, and erected a total of 76 buildings.<ref name="NPSccc">[[#NPSwebsite|NPS website]], "Civilian Conservation Corps"</ref> Trails in the Panamint Range were built to points of scenic interest, and an [[adobe]] village, laundry and trading post were constructed for [[Shoshone]] Indians. Five campgrounds, restrooms, an airplane landing field and picnic facilities were also built. 

Creation of the monument resulted in a temporary closing of the lands to prospecting and mining. However, Death Valley was quickly reopened to mining by [[Congress of the United States|Congressional]] action in June of the same year. As improvements in mining technology allowed lower grades of ore to be processed, and new heavy equipment allowed greater amounts of rock to be moved, mining in Death Valley changed. Gone were the days of the "single-blanket, jackass prospector" long associated with the romantic west. [[Open-pit mine|Open pit]] and [[strip mine]]s scarred the landscape as international mining corporations bought claims in highly visible areas of the national monument. The public outcry that ensued led to greater protection for all national park and monument areas in the United States.

[[Image:Mine at Leadfield.JPG|thumb|left|Inside an abandoned mine at Leadfield]]

In 1976 Congress passed the [[Mining in the Parks Act]], which closed Death Valley National Monument to the filing of new mining claims, banned open-pit mining and required the [[National Park Service]] to examine the validity of tens of thousands of pre-1976 mining claims.<ref name="NPSmining"/> Mining was allowed to resume on a limited basis in 1980 with stricter environmental standards.<ref name="NPSmining"/> The park's Resources Management Division monitors mining within park boundaries and continues to review the status of 125 unpatented mining claims and 19 patented claim groups, while ensuring that federal guidelines are followed and the park's resources are protected. As of 2003, the only active mining operation in Death Valley National Park is the [[Billie Mine]], an underground borax mine located along the road to Dante's View.

Death Valley National Monument was designated a [[biosphere reserve]] in 1984.<ref name="NPSindex"/> On October 31, 1994, the Monument was expanded by 1.3&nbsp;million acres (5,300&nbsp;km²) and redesignated a [[national park]] by passage of the [[Desert Protection Act]].<ref name="NPSindex"/> This made it the largest national park in the [[contiguous United States]].

Many of the larger cities and towns within the boundary of the regional [[ground water]] flow system that the park and its plants and animals rely upon are experiencing some of the fastest growth rates of any place in the United States. Notable examples within a {{convert|100|mi|km|sing=on}} radius of Death Valley National Park include [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] and [[Pahrump, Nevada]]. In the case of Las Vegas, the local Chamber of Commerce estimates that 6,000 people are moving to the city every month. Between 1985 and 1995, the population of the Las Vegas Valley increased from 550,700 to 1,138,800.<ref name="FocusWater"/>

==Geologic history==
{{main|Geology of the Death Valley area}}
[[Image:Death Valley basin cross section.png|thumbnail|290px|The deep Death Valley basin is filled with sediment (light yellow) eroded from the surrounding mountains. Black lines show some of the major faults that created the valley.]]
The park has a diverse and complex geologic history. Since its formation, the area that comprises the park has experienced at least four major periods of extensive [[volcanism]], three or four periods of major [[sedimentation]], and several intervals of major [[plate tectonics|tectonic]] deformation where the crust has been reshaped. Two periods of [[glaciation]] (a series of [[ice age]]s) have also had effects on the area, although no [[glacier]]s ever existed in the ranges now in the park. 

===Basement and Pahrump Group===
Little is known about the history of the oldest exposed [[rock (geology)|rock]]s in the area due to extensive [[metamorphism]] (alteration of rock by heat and pressure). [[Radiometric dating]] gives an age of 1,700&nbsp;million years for the metamorphism (during the [[Proterozoic]]: See bottom of the [[:image:Geologic events in Death Valley.png|geologic timeline]]).<ref name="Wright1997p611"/> About 1,400&nbsp;million years ago a mass of [[granite]] now in the Panamint Range intruded this complex.<ref name="Wright1997p631">{{harvnb|Wright and Miller|1997|p=631}}</ref> Uplift later exposed these rocks to nearly 500&nbsp;million years of erosion.<ref name="Wright1997p631"/>  

On these basement rocks was deposited the sedimentary [[formation (geology)|formation]] of the [[Pahrump Group]]. This occurred after uplift-associated erosion removed whatever rocks covered the Proteozoic-aged rocks. The Pahrump is composed of arkose [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] (quartz clasts in a concrete-like matrix) and [[mud stone]] in its lower part, followed by [[dolomite]] from [[carbonate]] banks topped by algal mats in [[stromatolite]]s, and finished with basin-filling sediment derived from the above, including possible [[glacial till]] from the hypothesized [[Snowball Earth]] glaciation.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright and Miller|1997|pp=631–632}}</ref> The very youngest rocks in the Pahrump Group are from [[basalt]]ic lava flows. 

===Rifting and deposition===
[[Image:Late Precambrian Noonday Formation.jpg|thumb|The Noonday Dolomite was formed from a carbonate shelf after the break-up of Rodinia]]
A rift opened and subsequently flooded the region as part of the breakup of the supercontinent [[Rodinia]] in the [[Neoproterozoic]] (by about 755&nbsp;million years ago) and the creation of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. A shoreline similar to the present [[Atlantic Ocean]] margin of the United States lay to the east. An [[algal mat]]-covered carbonate bank was deposited, forming the Noonday Dolomite.<ref name="Wright1997p632">{{harvnb|Wright and Miller|1997|p=632}}</ref> Subsidence of the region occurred as the [[continental crust]] thinned and the newly formed Pacific widened, forming the Ibex Formation. An angular [[unconformity]] (an uneven gap in the geologic record) followed. 

A true [[ocean basin]] developed to the west, breaking all the earlier formations along a steep front. A wedge of clastic sediment then began to accumulate at the base of the two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing [[continental shelf]]s.<ref name="Wright1997p634">{{harvnb|Wright and Miller|1997|p=634}}</ref> Three formations developed from sediment that accumulated on the wedge. The region's first known [[fossil]]s of complex life are found in the resulting formations.<ref name="Wright1997p634"/> Notable among these are the [[Ediacaran|Ediacara fauna]] and [[trilobite]]s, both part of the [[Cambrian Explosion]] of life. 

The sandy mudflats gave way about 550&nbsp;million years ago to a carbonate platform (similar to the one around the present-day [[Bahama]]s), which lasted for the next 300&nbsp;million&nbsp;years of [[Paleozoic]] time (refer to the middle of the [[:image:Geologic events in Death Valley.png|timescale image]]). Death Valley's position was then within ten or twenty degrees of the Paleozoic [[equator]]. Thick beds of carbonate-rich sediments were periodically interrupted by periods of emergence. Although details of geography varied during this immense interval of time, a north-northeasterly trending coastline generally ran from [[Arizona]] up through [[Utah]].  The resulting eight formations and one group are {{convert|20000|ft|km|0}} thick and underlay much of the Cottonwood, Funeral, Grapevine, and Panamint ranges.<ref name="Wright1997p634"/> 

===Compression and uplift===
In the early- to mid-[[Mesozoic]] the western edge of the North American continent was pushed against the oceanic plate under the Pacific Ocean, creating a [[subduction zone]].<ref name="Wright1997p634"/> A subduction zone is a type of contact between different crustal plates where heavier crust slides below lighter crust. Erupting volcanoes and uplifting mountains were created as a result, and the coastline was pushed to the west. The [[Sierran Arc]] started to form to the northwest from heat and pressure generated from subduction, and compressive forces caused [[thrust fault]]s to develop. 

A long period of uplift and erosion was concurrent with and followed the above events, creating a major unconformity, which is a large gap in the geologic record. Sediments worn off the Death Valley region were carried both east and west by wind and water.<ref name="Wright1997p635"/> No Jurassic- to [[Eocene]]-aged sedimentary formations exist in the area, except for some possibly Jurassic-age [[volcanic rock]]s (see the top of the [[:image:Geologic events in Death Valley.png|timescale image]]).<ref name="Wright1997p635">{{harvnb|Wright and Miller|1997|p=635}}</ref> 

Erosion over many millions of years created a relatively featureless plain. Thirty-five million years ago, sluggish streams migrated laterally over its surface. Several other similar formations were also laid down. 

===Stretching and lakes===
[[Image:Lake Manly system.png|thumb|The Lake Manly lake system as it might have looked during its last maximum extent 22,000&nbsp;years ago<ref name="Kiver1999p281">{{harvnb|Kiver|1999|p=281}}</ref> (USGS image)]]
[[Basin and Range]]-associated stretching of large parts of crust below southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico started around 16&nbsp;million&nbsp;years ago and the region is still spreading.<ref name="Wright1997p611"/> This stretching began to effect the Death and Panamint valleys area by 3&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name="Kiver1999p278">{{harvnb|Kiver|1999|p=278}}</ref>. Before this, rocks now in the Panamint Range were on top of rocks that would become the Black Mountains and the Cottonwood Mountains. Lateral and vertical transport of these blocks was accomplished by movement on normal [[fault (geology)|fault]]s. Right-lateral movement along strike-slip faults that run parallel to and at the base of the ranges also helped to develop the area.<ref name="Wright1997p616"/> Torsional forces, probably associated with northwesterly movement of the [[Pacific Plate]] along the [[San Andreas Fault]] (west of the region), is responsible for the lateral movement.<ref name="Kiver1999p278"/> 

Igneous activity associated with this stretching occurred from 12&nbsp;million to 4&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name="Wright1997p616">{{harvnb|Wright and Miller|1997|p=616}}</ref> Sedimentation is concentrated in valleys (basins) from material eroded from adjacent ranges. The amount of sediment deposited has roughly kept up with this subsidence, resulting in retention of more or less the same valley floor elevation over time. 

[[Pleistocene]] ice ages started 2&nbsp;million years ago, and melt from alpine [[glacier]]s on the nearby Sierra Nevada Mountains fed a series of lakes that filled Death and Panamint valleys and surrounding basins (see the top of the [[:image:Geologic events in Death Valley.png|timescale image]]). The lake that filled Death Valley was the last of a chain of lakes fed by the [[Amargosa River|Amargosa]] and [[Mojave River]]s, and possibly also the [[Owens River]]. The large lake that covered much of Death Valley's floor, which geologists call [[Lake Manly]], started to dry up 10,500&nbsp;years ago.<ref name="Sharp1997p41">{{harvnb|Sharp|1997|p=41}}</ref> [[Saltpan]]s and playas were created as ice age glaciers retreated, thus drastically reducing the lakes' water source. Only faint shorelines are left.

==Biology==
[[Image:Amargosa.jpg|thumb|290px|During very wet periods, the Amargosa River can flow at the surface, as it did in Death Valley during the wet winter of 2005. Wildflowers also peak during wetter years.]]
[[habitat (ecology)|Habitat]] varies from saltpan at {{convert|282|ft|m}} below sea level to the sub-alpine conditions found on the summit of Telescope Peak, which rises to {{convert|11049|ft|m}}.<ref name="NPSplants">[[#NPSwebsite|NPS website]], "Plants"</ref> Vegetation zones include [[Creosote Bush]], [[Salt bush|Desert Holly]], and [[mesquite]] at the lower elevations and [[Sagebrush|sage]] up through [[shadscale]], [[blackbrush]], [[Joshua Tree]], [[Piñon pine|pinyon]]-[[juniper]], to [[Limber Pine]] and [[Great Basin Bristlecone Pine|Bristlecone Pine]] woodlands.<!--I can't quite make sense of this sentence.!--><ref name="NPSplants"/> The saltpan is devoid of vegetation, and the rest of the valley floor and lower slopes have sparse cover, although where water is available, an abundance of vegetation is usually present. 
These zones and the adjacent desert support a variety of wildlife [[species]], including 51 species of native [[mammal]]s, 307 species of [[bird]]s, 36 species of [[reptile]]s, 3 species of [[amphibia]]ns, and 2 species of native [[fish]].<ref name="NPSanimal">[[#NPSwebsite|NPS website]], "Animals"</ref> 

Small mammals are more numerous than large mammals, such as [[Bighorn Sheep]], [[Coyote]]s ([[:Image:California Death Valley Coyote.jpg|image]]), [[Bobcat]]s,  [[Kit Fox]]es, [[Cougar]]s, and [[Mule Deer]].<ref name="NPSanimal"/> Mule Deer are present in the pinyon/juniper associations of the Grapevine, Cottonwood, and Panamint ranges.<ref name="NPSanimal"/> Bighorn Sheep are a rare species of [[mountain sheep]] that exist in isolated bands in the Sierra and in Death Valley. These are highly adaptable animals and can eat almost any plant. They have no known predators, but humans and [[Donkey|burro]]s compete for habitat. 

[[Image:Death Valley Pupfish spawning in Salt Creek.jpg|thumb|left|[[Death Valley Pupfish]] spawning in Salt Creek]]
The ancestors of the [[Death Valley Pupfish]] swam to the area from the [[Colorado River]] via a long-since dried-up system of rivers and lakes (see [[Lake Manly]]). They now live in two separate populations: one in Salt Creek and another in Cottonwood Marsh.  

Death Valley is one of the hottest and driest places in North America, yet it is home to over 1,000 species of [[plant]]s; 23 of which are not found anywhere else.<ref name="NPSplants"/> Adaptation to the dry environment is key. For example, creosote bush and mesquite have tap-[[root]] systems that can extend {{convert|50|ft|m}} down in order to take advantage of a year-round supply of [[ground water]]. The diversity of Death Valley's plant communities results partly from the region's location in a transition zone between the [[Mojave Desert]], the [[Great Basin|Great Basin Desert]] and the [[Sonoran Desert]]. 

[[Image:Sphinx moth on rock nettle at Mosaic Canyon.jpg|thumb|[[Sphinx Moth]] on [[Rock Nettle]] in Mosaic Canyon]]
This location, combined with the great relief found within the Park, supports vegetation typical of three biotic [[life zone]]s:  the lower Sonoran, the Canadian, and the Arctic/Alpine in portions of the Panamint Range.  Based on the Munz and Keck (1968) classifications, seven plant communities can be categorized within these life zones, each characterized by dominant vegetation and representative of three vegetation types: scrub, desert woodland, and coniferous forest. Microhabitats further subdivide some communities into zones, especially on the valley floor.

Unlike more typical locations across the Mojave Desert, many of the water-dependent Death Valley habitats possess a diversity of plant and animal species that are not found anywhere else in the world.<ref name="FocusWater"/> The existence of these species is due largely to a unique geologic history and the process of [[evolution]] that has progressed in habitats that have been isolated from one another since the [[Pleistocene]] epoch.

==Activities==
{{seealso|Places of interest in the Death Valley area}}

Sightseeing is available by personal automobile, [[four-wheel drive]], bicycle, [[mountain bicycle|mountain bike]] (on established roadways only), and [[hiking]].  [[California State Route 190|State Route 190]], the Badwater Road, the Scotty's Castle Road, and paved roads to Dante's View and Wildrose provide access to the major scenic viewpoints and historic points of interest. More than {{convert|350|mi|km}} of unpaved and four-wheel-drive roads provide access to wilderness hiking, camping, and historical sites.<ref>{{harvnb|NPS|2002|p=55}}</ref> All vehicles must be licensed and street legal. There are hiking trails of varying lengths and difficulties, but most backcountry areas are accessible only by cross-country hiking. There are literally thousands of hiking possibilities. The normal season for visiting the park is from October 15 to May 15 due to summer extremes in temperature.  A costumed living history tour of the historic Death Valley [[Scotty's Castle]] is conducted for a fee. 

[[Image:surfing Star Dune.JPG|thumb|left|A tourist sliding down Star Dune in the Mesquite Flat Dune field]]
There are nine designated campgrounds within the park, and overnight backcountry camping permits are available at the Visitor Center.<ref>[[#NPSwebsite|NPS website]], "Campgrounds"</ref> [[Xanterra Parks & Resorts]] owns and operates a private resort, the Furnace Creek Inn and Ranch Resort, <ref name="NPSguide"/> which comprises two separate and distinct hotels: the Furnace Creek Inn is a four-star historic hotel, and the Furnace Creek Ranch is a three-star ranch-style property reminiscent of the mining and prospecting days. Xanterra also operates the [[Stovepipe Wells, California|Stovepipe Wells Village]] motel. The Furnace Creek Inn and Ranch and the Stovepipe Wells Village are the only inns located inside Death Valley proper. There are a few motels near various entrances to the park, in [[Shoshone, California|Shoshone]], [[Death Valley Junction]], and [[Panamint Springs]].

The visitor center is located in the Furnace Creek resort area on State Route 190. A 12-minute introductory slide program is shown every 30&nbsp;minutes.<ref>[[#NPSwebsite|NPS website]], "Ranger Programs"</ref> During the winter season—November through April—rangers offer interpretive tours and a wide variety of walks, talks, and slide presentations about Death Valley cultural and natural history. The visitor center has displays dealing with the park's geology, climate, wildlife and natural history. There are also specific sections dealing with the human history and pioneer experience. The [[Death Valley Natural History Association]] maintains a bookstore specifically geared to the natural and cultural history of the park. 

Death Valley National Park is a popular location for stargazing as it has one of the darkest night skies in the United States. Despite Death Valley's remote location, its air quality and night visibility are threatened by civilization. In particular, light pollution is introduced by nearby [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].<ref>[[#NPSwebsite|NPS website]], "Lightscape / Night Sky"</ref>
