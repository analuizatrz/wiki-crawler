'''The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game''' (abbreviated as LotR SBG), often referred to by players as '''Lord of the Rings''', is a [[miniature wargaming|tabletop miniature wargame]] produced by [[Games Workshop]] (GW). It is based on [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy]] directed by [[Peter Jackson]], and [[The Lord of the Rings|the book that inspired it]], written by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. 

It was initially released in [[2001]] to tie in with the movie ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. New box sets with updated rules were also released for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film)|The Two Towers]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film)|The Return of the King]]'' movies. Later Games Workshop also began to add content that was featured in the original book but not in the film adaptations (''e.g.'' [[Tom Bombadil]], [[Radagast (Middle-earth)|Radagast]] and [[Glorfindel]]), first with the ''Shadow and Flame'' supplement, and most recently with the ''Gondor in Flames'' supplement. This was generally supported, but there were mixed reactions when Games Workshop invented characters and wrote histories for lands Tolkien wrote little about, such as [[Harad]] and [[Khand]].

Games Workshop released a complete new edition of the rules in [[September 2005]], entitled ''The One Rulebook to Rule them All'', and a compact edition entitled ''The Mines of Moria''. However, these were subjected to scrutiny because some profiles were omitted.<ref name="Army of the Dead">Although the [[Dead Men of Dunharrow|Army of the Dead]] Profiles were included in the compact "Mines of Moria" edition of the rules, they were accidentally omitted from the "One Rulebook". Because they were unavailable through what was supposed to have been the defining ruleset, they are available online for download: [http://uk.games-workshop.com/thelordoftherings/armyofthedead/1/]. [[Orc (Middle-earth)#Golfimbul|Golfimbul]] had been intentionally replaced with the standard Orc Captain Profile.</ref>

==Licensing==
[[Image:Ringstrilogyposter.jpg|thumb|250px|Much of Games Workshop's license is based on [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy]].]]
Games Workshop has the rights to produce a skirmish wargame based on the films, and also on ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]'' books, in the [[Miniature figure (gaming)#Scales|25mm miniature scale]].<ref>"Note that these figures are 25 mm and not the 28 mm figures that are more popular today"; {{cite web | title = Painting the Lord of the Rings Mines of Moria Game | date = 2005-11-23 | url = http://www.io.com/~beckerdo/minis/mini28/LotRMoria/ | accessdate = 2007-07-17 }}</ref> (The rights to produce a roleplaying game version of the films were sold to another firm, [[Decipher, Inc.]]) They also have the rights to produce a [[Battle of Five Armies]] game called "[[The Hobbit: Strategy Battle Game]]", using smaller miniatures to enact larger battles (more akin to the ''[[Warmaster]]'' system).<ref>{{cite web | title = Games Workshop Online Store | date = 2005-12-16 | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/storefront/store.uk?do=Individual&code=60011699001&orignav=9 | accessdate = 2007-06-16 }}</ref> Under this separate licence, the rights to the 25mm scale normally used were already owned by another company, causing the game to be done in 10 mm scale for the normal warriors, and a larger "heroic" scale for the named characters.

Although the contract between Games Workshop and [[Tolkien Estate]] is private, several aspects of it are known or speculated on. Games Workshop has not acquired the rights to ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', which is currently the exclusive property of the Tolkien Estate. However, the company is allowed to write its own fiction to fill in the gaps in [[Tolkien's legendarium|The Lord of the Rings Universe]]. This is particularly true of Harad, where invented placenames include "Dalamyr", "Kârna", "Badharkân", "Hidâr", "Nâfarat", "Abrakân", and "Dhâran-sar".<ref name="BOPF">''The Battle of the Pelennor Fields Supplement''</ref>

In the 1980s, Games Workshop also had an unrelated series of Lord of the Rings models. However, these were often original character designs from [[Citadel Miniatures]], based on fantasy art popular of the time, and are not tied in to the designs created for the movies.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Stuff of Legends | url = http://www.solegends.com/citlotr/index.htm | accessdate = 2007-07-03 }}</ref>

==The Hobby==
===Collecting===
[[Image:GondorianKnights.jpg|thumb|300px|left|A boxed set of [[Gondor]]ian [[Knights]].]]
Similar to [[Warhammer Fantasy Battle]] players, Lord of the Rings players commonly collect and paint one army (or more) of their choice and find opponents (with similarly collected armies) to play against.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Lord of the Rings Army building articles | work = Article | publisher = Games Workshop | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/thelordoftherings/army-building/ | accessdate = 2007-06-16 }}</ref> Armies can be built up from through the purchase of boxed sets (usually having 20 or 24 plastic miniatures in each) or "blister packs" (usually containing no more than three finely detailed metal miniatures) to build up a reasonable sized fighting force. Others simply collect the miniatures because they like the way they look. One popular way of collecting was through ''[[Battle Games in Middle-earth]]'' — a DeAgostini magazine that came with a free miniature (some of which were exclusive to the publication) and hobby guides.<ref>{{cite web | title = Battle Games in Middle-earth | work = Website | publisher = DeAgostini | url = http://www.deagostini.co.uk/lordoftherings/ | accessdate = 2007-07-03 }}</ref>

As such, there are a wide variety of miniatures in the ever-growing range, including promotional miniatures, such as "[[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] on Dead Uruk-hai". Games Workshop began to discontinue some of their metal miniatures, so that they could replace them with plastic miniatures. However, there was much complaint when they retired the popular "[[Boromir]] Captain of the White Tower" miniature, and it was later brought back into production.<ref>{{cite web | title = Boromir, Captain of the White Tower | publisher = Games Workshop | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/storefront/store.uk?do=Individual&code=9947146404801&orignav=9 | accessdate = 2007-07-03 }}</ref>

There are a large number of [[The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game#Differences from Warhammer|differences from Warhammer]] in The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game, which makes it unique and more realistic, accounting for its popularity as Games Workshop's third core system.

===Modelling===
[[Image:GrimhelmConversion.jpg|right|thumb|Mixing parts from different models is a popular method of conversion (a converted [[Maeglin]] miniature [http://www.one-ring.co.uk/phpBB2/album_personal.php?user_id=2316]).]]
Since the [[Figure painting (hobby)|models are hand-painted]] and assembled by the player, players are often encouraged to design their own paint schemes as well as using the pre-designed ones displayed in the various books. They are also encouraged to further modify their miniatures using parts from other kits and models (known as "[[Bitz#Bitz|bitz]]" to players), modelling putty, or whatever the modeller can scrounge up.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Lord of the Rings Modelling articles | work = Article | publisher = Games Workshop | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/thelordoftherings/modelling/ | accessdate = 2007-06-16 }}</ref> These [[Miniature conversion|''conversions'']] are often entered into contests at sponsored tournaments and similar gaming events, such as the [[Golden Demon]] or the [http://www.one-ring.co.uk/phpBB2/comp.php?mode=cat One Ring Awards].

Terrain is a very important part of play.<ref>''Mines of Moria, p 8</ref> Though Games Workshop makes terrain kits available, many hobbyists prefer to make their own elaborate and unique set pieces. Common household items and hobby materials such as [[balsa wood]], [[cardboard]], and [[polystyrene]] can be transformed into ruins from the Second Age, woodland terrain, or the rocky wild of [[Middle-earth]] with the addition of plasticard, putty, and a bit of patience and skill.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Lord of the Rings Terrain articles | work = Article | publisher = Games Workshop | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/thelordoftherings/terrain/ | accessdate = 2007-06-16 }}</ref>

[[Diorama]]s, often depicting scenes from the film and books, bring terrain and conversion skills together.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Lord of the Rings Diorama articles | work = Article Library | publisher = The One Ring | url = http://www.one-ring.co.uk/phpBB2/kb.php?mode=cat&cat=22 | accessdate = 2007-06-16 }}</ref> However, due to the licensing agreements between [[New Line Cinema]] and [[Games Workshop]], pieces of models for the Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game are not allowed to be combined with other model lines for official tournaments or conversion awards.<ref name="GDCG">{{cite web | title = Golden Demon Competitor's Guidelines | work = Competition Rules | publisher = Games Workshop | url =http://uk.games-workshop.com/goldendemon/competitors-guidelines/1/ | accessdate = 2007-07-17 }}</ref> The same is true for pieces from other manufacturers.<ref name="GDCG"/>

==Current state of play==
[[Image:ShadowAndFlame.jpg|thumb|The ''Shadow and Flame Supplement'' - the first Games Workshop supplement to feature content that was not in the films.]]
===Overview of Rulesets===
As of September 2005, the rules for Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game are in their fourth edition. The first three editions of the rulebooks were released with the [[Lord of the Rings (film)|Lord of the Rings films]], but Games Workshop used the magazine ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'' and various Supplements to "go beyond what is presented in the films of The Lord of the Rings and delve into the rich material of J. R. R. Tolkien's books."<ref name=Supplements>Alessio Cavatore, ''Shadow and Flame'', page 3 ([[2003]]).</ref> The current edition, ''The One Rulebook to Rule them All'', contains the entire set of rules updated and presented in a single large volume, including those of previous supplements. The three older editions are to be re-released in updated supplements, while the compact ''Mines of Moria'' edition contains the updated rules only for what was shown in the films. Currently, the official editions of Rulebooks and Supplements include:
* [[The Fellowship of the Ring]] Rulebook, for the first installment of the films, released as an updated supplement.
* [[The Two Towers]] Rulebook, for the second installment of the films, released as an updated supplement.
* [[The Return of the King]] Rulebook, released in early August as an updated supplement for the third and final film installment.
* [http://uk.games-workshop.com/shadowandflame/ Shadow and Flame Supplement], featuring rules for characters from the book not included in the film.
* [http://uk.games-workshop.com/thesiegeofgondor/ The Siege of Gondor Supplement], featuring [[siege]] rules for the game, centering around [[Minas Tirith]].
* [http://uk.games-workshop.com/thebattleofpelennorfields/ The Battle of the Pelennor Fields Supplement], featuring rules for larger battles involving [[Mûmak]]il and [[Haradrim]].

*[http://uk.games-workshop.com/khazaddum/ Khazad-Dûm Supplement], covering the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] of [[Erebor]] & [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Khazad-dûm]], and new units for the side of Evil (eg [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragon]]s).
*[[Gondor in Flames]] Supplement, released with new plastic miniatures, such as [[Battle of the Morannon|Morannon Orcs]] and Gondorian Knights.
[[Image:Legions of Middle Earth.gif|thumb|''Legions of Middle-earth'' - an army building book.]]
For materials done under the previous iteration of the rules, there exist [[errata]] and [[FAQ]] files, to ensure potential rules conflicts between editions are resolved universally.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Shrine of Knowledge | work = Rules Errata | publisher = Games Workshop | date =  | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/news/errata/1/ | accessdate = 2007-07-03 }}</ref>

In addition to the official rulesets, Games Workshop has also encouraged the writing of unofficial "[[house rules]]" by wargamers.<ref name="house rules">{{cite web | title = Games Workshop Intellectual Property | date = 2005-11-12 | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/legal/canandcant/1/ | accessdate = 2007-06-16 }}:<br>"''We encourage fellow hobbyists to invent rules that work for them. There is no need to stick precisely to the published rules. However, if you are thinking about making your own Codex'' [eg.] ''for your Space Marine chapter (in addition to following the other guidelines in this policy), please avoid making it look official as this may confuse gamers and amount to a challenge to our trademarks. Also, do not copy our official publications or documents.''"</ref> As such, there have been a number of unofficial fan supplements and other supplementary material on the internet; the most notable of which was ''The Age of the King'', made by ''The One Ring''.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Age of the King | work = Unofficial Rules Supplement | publisher = The One Ring | date =  | url = http://www.one-ring.co.uk/index.php?page=79 | accessdate = 2007-07-02 }}</ref> Although some of its subject matter was later covered by official rulesets,<ref>Compare with Games Workshop's ''A Shadow in the East Supplement''</ref> it is still considered "the benchmark against which all others are measured".<ref>{{cite web | title = How to Write Supplements | work = Forum Sticky Topic | author = Dagorlad (Alan Harrison) | publisher = The One Ring | date = 2005-06-20 | url = http://www.one-ring.co.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=4295 | accessdate = 2007-07-19 }}</ref> In many cases, supplements are written for areas where Games Workshop's licence does not extend, such as ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.<ref name="GondolinSupplements">Supplements have been made depicting the Fall of [[Gondolin]], [http://www.freewebs.com/fogsupplement/] [http://www.freewebs.com/fallofgondolin/] based on ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' respectively, as well as about the [[Kinslaying]] at [[Alqualondë]] and the [[War of Wrath]]. [http://www.setbb.com/cheeseweb/]</ref>

====Legions of Middle-earth====
As of [[August 2006]], Games Workshop released the new expansion entitled "''Legions of Middle-earth''", centering around theming and army building.<ref name="LOMEReview">{{cite web | title = Legions of Middle Earth Book Review | work = Review | publisher = Area 52 | author = Craig Woodfield | url = http://www.area52.com.au/articles/ttg/legions_middle_earth.htm | accessdate = 2007-07-18 }}</ref>  It is not a supplement or rulebook, as it contains no rules; instead, it provides army lists for players to theme their forces around, and scenarios which are designed to work in conjunction with them. However, Games Workshop also released supplement summaries online in conjunction with ''Legions of Middle-earth'', so effectively a player only requires ''Legions of Middle-earth'' and the main Rulebook in order to use the rules of the supplements.<ref>{{cite web | title = Profiles of Middle-earth | work = Rules Summary | publisher = Games Workshop | date =  | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/legionsofmiddleearth/reference/1/ | accessdate = 2007-07-03 }}</ref><ref>With the exception that the summaries do give access to a model's basic wargear, available "Magic" or the Movement rate.</ref> According to one review, the army lists would transform the game "from what has essentially been a scenario-based game that appealed mostly to collectors to a genuine tournament-compatible game system," although in this it "could have been a little bit more restrictive."<ref name="LOMEReview"/> Interestingly, some of the miniatures for the point values listed have not yet been released; this way the book does not become obsolete with any future releases for some time.

====Variants and Derived Games====
''[[All at Sea]]'' is an adaptation of the rules for naval conflicts. The official rules were a modied version of the [[Warhammer Fantasy Battles|Warhammer]] Boat rules, adapted by Nick Davis and first presented in Games Workshop's [[White Dwarf magazine]] (''US issue 295'').<ref name="NavalRules">{{cite web | author = Nick Davis | title = All At Sea Part One | work = Ruleset | publisher = White Dwarf | date =  | url = http://www.alt-world.com/alt-world/LOTR/undersail.htm | accessdate = 2007-06-14 }}</ref> The game's mechanics centred around [[Boarding (attack)|boarding parties]], with options for [[naval ram|ramming actions]] and [[naval artillery]] in the form of [[ballista]]e and other [[siege engine]]s.<ref name="NavalRules"/> Model ships are built by hobbyists, just as normal miniature terrain, such as "[[carrack|great ships]]" of [[Pelargir]], [[cog (ship)|cogs]] of [[Dol Amroth]] and [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsair]] [[Galleys#The Galleas warship|galleys]].<ref name="Pelargir">{{cite web | title = The Ports of Pelargir | work = Website | date =  | url = http://www.freewebs.com/portsofpelargir | accessdate = 2007-06-14 }}</ref>

===Game Systems===
The standard game is played with two or more armies on a board generally 4 [[Foot (unit of length)|feet]] long and 4 feet wide (48 [[inch]]es or 120 [[centimetre]]s), usually deployed within 6 inches of opposite board edges.<ref>For example, see ''The Battle of the Pellenor Fields'', p 34-35</ref> Similar to [[Warhammer Fantasy Battles|Warhammer Fantasy]], the game uses a "points-system" to assign values to each miniature, allowing players to ensure that their armies are evenly matched. The game is primarily a skirmish game, but can be played in varying scale:
* Scenario - These are based on an event in the book or film, and the armies are predetermined and fought using Special Scenario-specific Rules.<ref>''Mines of Moria'', p 70-75</ref>
* Points Match - These are played between two forces of equal size, generally of 500 Points each (which is usually no more than 50 miniatures per side).<ref>''Mines of Moria'', p 74</ref>
* War Party - This is a stricter form of the Points Match, using forces of no more than 250 Points.<ref>{{cite web | title = War Party | work = Rules | publisher = Games Workshop | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/thelordoftherings/war-party/1/ | accessdate = 2007-07-03 }}</ref>
* Battle Company - This is an experience-based system which is played out with no more than 25 miniatures.<ref>{{cite web | title = Battle Companies | work = Rules | publisher = Games Workshop | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/thelordoftherings/battle-companies/1/ | accessdate = 2007-07-03 }}</ref>

The Turn system game is played using four phases:
* Priority Phase - The players roll [[dice]] to see who gets to take their Turn first.<ref name="MoM13">''The Lord of The Rings Strategy Battle Game: The Mines of Moria'', p 13</ref>
* Move Phase - The players move their miniatures (to a maximum distance that is usually 6 inches).<ref name="MoM13"/> "Magic" (''eg.'' "Compel") is also used during this phase.
* Shoot Phase - [[Bow (weapon)|Missile]]-armed miniatures can shoot.<ref name="MoM13"/>
* Fight Phase - Dice are rolled for each group of miniatures in base contact with each other to see which wins the combat.<ref name="MoM13"/>

While the game is designed usually for play by only two players (as the force lists are divided into "Good" and "Evil"),<ref>''Mines of Moria'', p 74</ref> very large battles (generally with more than 100 models each side) become easier to manage with more than one person working together on a team.

===Differences from Warhammer===
The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game is sometimes called "Warhammer Lord of the Rings"<ref>[http://www.google.ie/search?as_q=&hl=en&num=10&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=Warhammer+Lord+of+the+Rings&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&as_dt=e&as_sitesearch=en.wikipedia.org&as_rights=&safe=images Google search]</ref><ref>[http://search.ebay.co.uk/search/search.dll?from=R40&_trksid=m37&satitle=Warhammer+Lord+of+the+Rings Items entered under "Warhammer Lord of the Rings" on Ebay]</ref> — in part because it is the third core game produced by Games Workshop (the first two of which were titled "Warhammer"), but possibly also because it combines fantasy-style battle traits from [[Warhammer Fantasy Battle]] with the squad flexibility of [[Warhammer 40,000]]. ("Warhammer Lord of the Rings" is also faster to say than the full title). However, the Lord of the Rings is not related to the [[Warhammer Fantasy (setting)|Warhammer Fantasy]] setting universe, and the differences can account for its popularity. Many Lord of the Rings players prefer it to Warhammer because it is less "cartoony", and say that the armies look nicer and more realistic when fully painted.<ref>{{cite web | title = A discussion of painting genres | date = 2006-04-25 | publisher = The One Ring | url = http://www.one-ring.co.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=6933&start=0&postdays=0&postorder=asc&highlight=&sid=7c84c46a6e979952a736766ca68abb84 | accessdate = 2007-06-16 }}</ref> The miniatures of the two Warhammer games are in a "heroic" scale, while Lord of the Rings miniatures are in realistic proportions. This was noted by sculptor [[Dave Thomas]], who is best known for his work with Warhammer 40,000 [[Space Marines]]:

{{blockquote|"With Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer, we have a different set of restrictions. Models for The Lord of The Rings need to be made to a smaller, more realistic scale than other [[Citadel Miniatures|Citadel miniatures]], and they need to meet external approval too. It's a very different process, and it gives us very different challenges."<ref>{{cite web | title = Forging the Fellowship | publisher = Games Workshop | work = Article | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/thefellowshipofthering/designers-notes/2/ | accessdate = 2007-12-12 }}</ref>}}

[[Image:MinasTirithSBG.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] ([[Minas Tirith]]), from [[Games Day (Games Workshop)|Games Day 2005]].]]
Another key difference to Warhammer is that Lord of the Rings lacks some of the more complicated rules of the other two systems, making it the most flexible and realistic game by Games Workshop.<ref name="Simplicity"/> For example, the players take turns playing out one phase at a time, but in both forms of Warhammer, each player plays their full turn at once. Also, for Warhammer Fantasy Battles most of the miniatures are locked in block formations; Lord of the Rings allows freedom of movement for each individual miniature.<ref>{{cite web | title = A discussion of simplicity in wargames | date = 2005-11-12 | url = http://www.angelfire.com/rings/firstwarofthering/WarhammerLotR.html | accessdate = 2007-06-16 }}</ref> For this reason, the turn and movement systems are considered more realistic than those of Warhammer Fantasy or Warhammer 40,000, making it the easiest to learn, but "the hardest to master".<ref name="WD311">''[[United Kingdom|UK]] [[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]] 311'' ([[2006]]) </ref>

In contrast, however, some Warhammer players frown on Lord of the Rings because they think the miniatures are geared too much towards skirmish and that the armies used are not of a large enough scale (generally armies in LotR are no more than 600 points, while Warhammer usually has well in excess of 1000 point armies). However, the Lord of the Rings [[Mûmak]] is one of the largest plastic miniatures Games Workshop has ever created (discounting some [[Forge World]] products), and the game does allow for larger [[pitched battle]]s and sieges to be recreated, such as the [[Battle of the Hornburg|Battles of the Hornburg]] or [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields|the Pelennor]].<ref>''Siege of Gondor''</ref>

==Troop Types==
<!--For readability, please try to keep no more than one external link per each army where possible. -Grimhelm -->
There are two types of troops: Warriors and Heroes.<ref>''The Two Towers'', p 11 & 42</ref> Heroes have characteristics which set them apart from the Warriors they lead, and can be named or unnamed characters: [[Aragorn]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], Captains, etc. Warriors are the core of the army: Warriors of Harad, Riders of Rohan, Men of Gondor, etc. Each army must be either Good or Evil, and can only include miniatures from that side (each model is named in the rules as being either Good or Evil).

As Tolkien's world is very rich in detail, players generally prefer to base their armies around one of the following themes:

==="[[Middle-earth peoples#Free peoples|The Free Peoples]]" (Good)===
[[Image:GWElfBowman.jpg|thumb|150px|A [[Calaquendi|High Elf]] miniature.]]
* '''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''' (Good) - Most scenario-based games require at least one member of the Fellowship. Whilst not a real army, they are effective as a skirmish force, due to their high points-values and limited numbers.<ref>''Mines of Moria'', p 76-81</ref>
* '''[[Quendi|Elves]]''' (Good) - The Quendi are the oldest of the races of Middle-earth, and the majority of armies are either [[Silvan Elves|Wood Elves]] or [[Calaquendi|High Elves]], often allied with Men of [[Númenor]] from the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]]. Individually, Elf Warriors are among the most powerful and bravest of available races, with high Courage and Defence values.<ref name="MOM89">''Mines of Moria'', p 89</ref> Also Elven armies have the best archers in the game, and are also notable for their potent powers of healing and foresight among Heroes such as [[Galadriel]] and [[Elrond]].<ref name="MOM82">''Mines of Moria'', p 82-83</ref> In earlier editions of the rules, Games Workshop kept the two kinds of Elves separate, and although the ''One Rulebook'' merges the two "races", they are most often kept separated into the two main themes:<ref>{{cite web | title = Elves | work = Article | publisher = Games Workshop | date = | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/elves/ | accessdate = 2007-07-17 }}</ref>
:*'''[[Rivendell|Elven Havens]]''' - The Elves of [[Eriador]] are considered the "High Elves" of the Last Alliance, and are not commonly seen in [[Third Age]] games.<ref>Note that [[Gil-galad]] was ommitted from ''The Two Towers'' Rulebook, set in the [[Third Age]].</ref> Their powerful Heroes include [[Gil-galad]] and [[Elrond]], with the latter sometimes used outside the [[Second Age]]. 
:*'''[[Lórien|Woodland Realms]]''' - Originally, the Wood Elves were limited to a small range of metal miniatures,<ref>''The Two Towers'', p 71 & 78</ref> but with the release of ''The Fall of the Necromancer Supplement'', a boxed set of plastics was released. Wood Elves include the Lothlórien Elves (also known as [[Haldir of Lórien|Haldir]]'s Elves) as their elite troops, but the bulk of their armies consist of the Taurdirim of [[Mirkwood]]. These armies can also include the members of the [[White Council]], and [[Ent]]s such as [[Treebeard]].<ref name="WhiteCouncil">{{cite web | title = The White Council | work = Article | publisher = Games Workshop | date = | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/thewhitecouncil | accessdate = 2007-07-17 }}</ref>
* '''[[Gondor]]''' (Good) - The Kingdom of the White Tree has the widest range of warriors and heroes available. It can be divided into three main themes: [[Minas Tirith]], [[Ithilien]] and [[Dol Amroth]]. Minas Tirith's key strength is in its armoured infantry, but it also has available mounted [[knights]] and the finest siege engines in the game: [[trebuchet]]s and [[Polybolos|"bolt throwers"]]. Minas Tirith armies often include elements from Ithilien armies, which has accurate archers. Dol Amroth is often considered to include the remaining fiefdoms of Gondor, boasting [[heavy cavalry]] (the only such available to Good armies) and courageous warriors, led by [[Imrahil]]. Dol Amroth is usually only combined with Minas Tirith in a [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] theme. A very small number of dedicated players also build their own [[carrack|ships]] of [[Pelargir]] or Dol Amroth out of wood and other materials.<ref name="Pelargir"/> Gondor is rarely allied with any armies other than Rohan. Some of its less common themes include:<ref>{{cite web | title = Gondor | work = Article | publisher = Games Workshop | date = | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/gondor | accessdate = 2007-07-17 }}</ref>
**'''[[Númenor]]''' - Númenor is one of the smaller good armies related to Gondor, representing also the [[Princely Houses of the Númenórean Realms-in-Exile|Númenórean Realms in Exile]] (''ie.'' the [[Arnor]] and Gondor of the [[Second Age]]). Whilst it could be considered part of Gondor, it is only really used in Scenarios set in the Second Age (although sometimes its warriors can be used to represent Wardens of Pelargir). Númenor has a relatively limited range of warriors, but they are amongst the best warriors in the game, having access to the mighty heroes [[Isildur]] and [[Elendil]]. However, a note in the rulebook bans Númenórean armies to be used outside Second Age scenarios, so they are rarely seen in battle. Númenor is most frequently used with Elves, in Last Alliance-themed armies. 
**'''[[Dead Men of Dunharrow|Army of the Dead]]''' - Perhaps the smallest Good army available, the Army of the Dead offers only one Hero and one Warrior type and one Cavalry type. They were accidentally omitted from the ''One Rulebook'', so their rules can be downloaded through the [[Games Workshop]] website.<ref name="Army of the Dead"> </ref> They are usually allied with Gondor or [[Dúnedain]], and led by [[Aragorn]] and the King of the Dead for a Pelennor Fields theme.
[[Image:HornburgLOTRSBG.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Battle of the Hornburg]] ([[Rohan]]).]]
* '''[[Rohan]]''' (Good) - Armies of the Riddermark tend to focus on [[light cavalry]], which are its core unit (though Rohan infantry are often used in [[Helm's Deep]] scenarios). These are armed with [[pilum|throwing spears]], unique to Rohan, bows and shields. Earlier editions of the rules made these especially powerful, but the current edition has balanced the game by increasing the points cost. On the other hand, Rohan still has [[Royal Guard]] and medium heroes such as [[Éomer]] and [[Háma]]; in addition, it has benefited from release of [[Eorl the Young]], and a number of new releases to the Rohan range such as [[Erkenbrand]] were included in the more recent ''The Two Towers Supplement''.<ref>{{cite web | title = Rohan | work = Article | publisher = Games Workshop | date = | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/rohan | accessdate = 2007-07-17 }}</ref>
* '''[[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]]''' (Good) - Although the Dwarves move an inch slower than the average man-sized warrior (making them easy to outmanoeuvre), their powerful bows and the highest defence in the game can make them a hard opponent. Their elite warriors are the [[Khazad]] Guard, and they have powerful heroes such as [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]], [[Dáin II Ironfoot|Dáin]] and [[Balin (Middle-earth)|Balin]]. With the ''Khazad-Dûm Supplement'', Vault Wardens, Iron Guard and Dwarf [[Ballista]]e were introduced, along with the tactics such as the "[[Line (formation)|wall]]", "[[Encirclement|rock]]" and "[[V formation|flying axe]]" formations.<ref>{{cite web | last = Adam Troke | title = Tunnel Fighting Tactics | work = Article | publisher = Games Workshop | date = | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/khazaddum/tunnel-fighting/2/ | accessdate = 2007-05-21 }}</ref> They make few alliances, and even then usually only with [[Dale (Middle-earth)|Men of Dale]].<ref name="Khazddum">{{cite web | title = Dwarves | work = Article | publisher = Games Workshop | date = | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/dwarves | accessdate = 2007-07-17 }}</ref>
* '''[[Hobbit]]s''' (Good) - Armies of the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]] are more oriented around skirmishes, as pointswise they have the most inexpensive warriors and heroes in the game. Their archers are unmatched by all but the Elves, but their Hobbit militia are the slowest and weakest warriors in the game. Aside from the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of the Ring]], they never ally with other armies because of their fear of the outside world. Their heroes include [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo of the Nine Fingers]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Hobbits | work = Article | publisher = Games Workshop | date = | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/hobbits | accessdate = 2007-07-17 }}</ref>
*'''[[Dúnedain]]'''/'''[[Arnor]]''' (Good) - All Dúnedain and [[Rangers of the North]] are Heroes, making them expensive and rarely used. They are the prime example of an army that was excluded from the films, but was well-adapted by Games Workshop in a way that fit in with both the style of the films and their original mention in the books.<ref name="WD326">''[[United Kingdom|UK]] [[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]] 326''</ref> Their main named Heroes are [[Aragorn]] and [[Halbarad]] Dúnadan, who are often allied with [[Gildor Inglorion]] and the Elves of [[Rivendell]],<ref name="WD326"/> or indirectly with Hobbits in some Scenarios. In the One Rulebook, the Dúnedain are classed in the same section as [[Tom Bombadil]] and [[Goldberry]], though Tom and Goldberry are not allies but Scenario-specific characters from the [[Barrow-downs]]. They were expanded in the most recent supplement, ''[[Ruin of Arnor|The Ruin of Arnor]]'', allowing players to field Arnorian infantry, as well as heroes such as King [[Arvedui]] and [[Malbeth the Seer]].<ref name="WD326"/> Another common theme for the Dúnedain is the [[Grey Company]].<ref name="WD326"/>
*'''[[Drúedain]]''' (Good) - Whilst the Drúedain are never described in battle, in the book their leader [[Ghân-buri-Ghân]] aids Théoden's army on their way through [[Drúadan Forest]]. The Drúedain (or "Woses" as they are commonly known) are not yet available, although Ghân-buri-ghân has been available through ''Battle Games in Middle-earth''.
*'''The Wanderers in the Wild''' (Good) - The Wanderers in the wild are individuals that travel Middle-Earth, for several purposes, be it exploring or protecting others. They include popular characters such as [[Glorfindel]] and [[Sméagol]], but also characters invented by Games Workshop, like Múrin and Drár. They can ally with most armies. Other related smaller armies include:
**'''[[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Eagles of the Misty Mountains]]''', led by [[Gwaihir]], and usually allied with Gondor or Dwarves.
**'''[[Ent]]s''' are similar in that they are expensive, rarely used warriors.
**The as yet unreleased '''[[Beornings]]''', lead by Grimbeorn, have also been announced in ''Legions of Middle-earth''.
*'''[[Istari|The Wizards]]''' (Good) - The Wizards represent the [[Istari]] that fought for the Free Peoples during the Third Age. In addition to the more obvious [[Gandalf]] and [[Radagast]], there is also a "good" [[Saruman]] from the time of the [[White Council]]. Radagast usually allies with the Dwarves or the Woodland Realms, while Gandalf usually allies with Rohan, Gondor or the Fellowship.

==="[[Middle-earth peoples#Enslaved .27peoples.27|The Forces of Darkness]]" (Evil)===
* '''[[Angmar]]''' (Evil) - The dark land of Angmar is built on the ruins of the Lost Kingdom of [[Arnor]], terrorised by [[Nazgûl]] and [[Ghost|Spectres]]. Its army had no official rules until early [[2007]], except for the Ringwraiths and [[Barrow-wight]]s (which are nonetheless potent magic-users) and wild [[Warg]]s, lead by Warg chieftains. It never allies with other armies, although Orcs and Goblins are sometimes included in it. Angmar received official rules in ''[[Ruin of Arnor|The Ruin of Arnor]]'' Supplement, including Games Workshop's invented [[Troll (Middle-earth)#Troll types|Hill Troll]] Chieftain "Buhrdûr".<ref name="WD326"/> The earlier rules are still available to use in friendly games on Games Workshop's website.<ref>{{cite web | title = Vassals of the Witchking | work = Article | publisher = Games Workshop | date = | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/heraldsofdarkness/witchking-vassals/1/ | accessdate = 2007-07-17 }}</ref>
* '''[[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]]''' (Evil) - The subterranean realm of [[Khazad-dûm]] was built by the Dwarves, but it was taken by Evil. Now it is infested with [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Goblins]] and [[Troll (Middle-earth)|Cave Trolls]], and more frightening creatures such as the [[Balrog]] are the centerpiece of Moria forces.<ref name="Khazddum"/> Goblins are weak but inexpensive to field, making them numerous in games, and can be strengthened by Goblin Drums and Goblin Shamans. Moria allies with Isengard in the books and Games Workshop have also added Angmar, Dol Guldur, and Barad-dûr, and the Nazgûl to their allies list.<ref>''Legions of Middle-earth''</ref>
* '''[[Isengard]]''' (Evil) - The Army of the [[Saruman|White Hand]] is a reliable and varied force to collect, featuring a number of unique warrior and siege options, such as [[crossbows]] (the most powerful bows in the game), [[Pike (weapon)|pikes]] and a primitive form of explosive. Typical Isengard armies feature the Uruk-hai pikeblock, though they are often supported by light infantry such as Uruk-hai scouts, medium cavalry in the form of [[Warg]]s, or spellcasters in the form of Uruk Shamans or even [[Saruman]] himself. Games Workshop has also been criticised for ''The Two Towers Supplement'' allowing Isengard the option of a [[White Mountains (Middle-earth)|White Mountains]] Troll.<ref name="isentroll">{{cite web | title = Isengard Troll -- A Debate, not an Argument | date = 2006-06-01 | url = http://www.angelfire.com/rings/firstwarofthering/isentroll.html | accessdate = 2007-06-16 }}</ref> Isengard only ever allies with [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]], the [[Nazgûl]] and [[Dunland]], which rarely fights on its own and is almost always classed under Isengard anyway.<ref>{{cite web | title = Vassals of the Witchking | work = Article | publisher = Games Workshop | date = | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/isengard | accessdate = 2007-07-17 }}</ref> Players can also choose to represent Saruman's army after the fall of Isengard, complete with Rogues: the upcoming [[Bill Ferny]] miniature adds some depth to such a force.
[[Image:Khamul lotrsbg.jpg|thumb|right|[[Khamûl|Khamûl the Easterling]].]]
* '''[[Mordor]]''' (Evil) - Legions of the Eye are made up of various warrior types. Their core unit is the Orc warrior on foot, bolstered by [[Morannon]] Orcs and Mordor Uruk-hai. They also offer Siege [[Catapults]] and ballistae with [[mantlet]]s, led by [[Gothmog (Third Age)|Gothmog]]; these siege engines are often operated by [[Olog-hai|Mordor Trolls]], which can also be used as [[shock troops]]. However, the most dreaded element of Mordor armies is the Ringwraith on Fell-Beast, which, as a flying creature, can move around the board unimpeded and strike with dark magic. Mordor can be allied with any Evil army except Angmar or Isengard. [[Sauron]] is only ever fielded in person in campaigns set around the Last Alliance (or in Dol Guldur armies).<ref>{{cite web | title = Mordor | work = Article | publisher = Games Workshop | date = | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/mordor/ | accessdate = 2007-07-17 }}</ref>
**'''[[Nazgûl|The Nazgûl]]''' (Evil) - Although primarily Mordor-themed, the Nine were sent all over Middle-Earth, and have been classified as a separate army list accordingly. The Nazgûl consist of [[the Witch-king of Angmar]], [[Khamûl|Khamûl the Easterling]] and seven other unnamed Ringwraiths.
* '''[[Dol Guldur]]''' (Evil) - Dol Guldur armies form [[Sauron]]'s troops from the time that he was hiding in Southern [[Mirkwood]], and went under the name of the "Necromancer". There are two general themes by which players usually construct their armies. The first, and perhaps most obvious, is based around the fortress garrison of Dol Guldur, containing Sauron himself as the Necromancer, backed up by [[Castellan]]s of Dol Guldur, and usually Orcs and the occasional Troll. The other way is actually more of a general evil army of Mirkwood, containing [[tarantula|Giant Spiders]] led by the "Spider Queen". Both armies can include swarms of Giant [[Bats]], and can be allied. Other themes include Spiders allied with wild [[Warg]]s to form an army of wild creatures, or allied with Moria to represent a force from the Mountains of Mirkwood. Their biggest enemy are the Elves - the [[Silvan Elves|Taurdirim]] and the [[Galadriel|Galadhrim]].<ref name="WhiteCouncil"/>
* '''[[Harad]]''' (Evil) - The lands to the south are only briefly mentioned by Tolkien, and much of its forces and place-names have been invented by Games Workshop or Weta. It offers warriors and light cavalry that are inexpensive to field, and have poison arrows increasing their effectiveness against armoured warriors. Their most devastating miniature, however, is the [[Mûmak]]: the largest Games Workshop miniature ever, which in the game can trample enemy foot soldiers. Their invented heroes include [[Suladan]] and the [[assassin|hasharin]]. Players wanting to add variety can add the Mahûd of Far Harad, which include cavalry on camels, warriors with blowpipes and even Halftrolls. To date however, the only Mahûd miniature available is the Mahûd chieftain, an upgrade for the Mûmak. Another alternative to the usual Harad army is that of [[Umbar]], which uses Harad Warriors but involves [[Corsairs of Umbar|corsairs]].<ref name="Pelargir"/> There are a few Corsair models made by players, but they are a more common sight than Gondorian ships. Official Corsair models are expected in the upcoming ''Gondor in Flames Supplement''.<ref>{{cite web | title = Harad | work = Article | publisher = Games Workshop | date = | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/harad | accessdate = 2007-07-17 }}</ref>
* '''[[Easterlings]]''' (Evil) - In previous forms of the rules, the Easterlings were pitifully weak, offering only three warrior types cast in metal, and not even appearing until the third edition of the rules. However, their range has been increased enormously with the release of ''A Shadow in the East''. Games Workshop's Easterlings represent the [[Balchoth]], and have been based on a combination of imagery from the New Line films and history of the [[Sassanid Empire]]. They offer the unique [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]] (the first army to have pikes since Isengard), and are the only Evil army to feature [[heavy cavalry]], referred to as "[[cataphract|kataphracts]]". Despite these licences, they fit in very much with Tolkien's works and those of New Line. They frequently ally with Khand or Mordor.<ref>{{cite web | title = Vassals of the Witchking | work = Article | publisher = Games Workshop | date = | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/rhunandkhand/ | accessdate = 2007-07-17 }}</ref>
* '''[[Khand]]''' (Evil) - Tolkien wrote even less about Khand than he did about Harad, though we know that they had [[chariots]] and [[axes]]. Games Workshop has based their [[Variags of Khand]] on the [[Mongols]] and the [[Feudal Japan#Feudal Japan|Japanese]], featuring [[sashimono]]s and the unique chariots. There is some disagreement as to whether this was the right thing to do. It is believed that Tolkien intended the Variags to be much like the [[Varangians]] (hence the axes), and that the [[Wainriders]] (another tribe of Khandish men) were logically intended to have chariots (a progression of the [[wain]]s they had). The fact that Variags can be fielded as [[mercenaries]] hints to this. It was suggested that the Gondorians were unaware of the lands further east, and thus the names of the Variags and Wainriders had been mixed-up.<ref>{{cite web | title = A discussion from the Games Workshop forum | date =  | url = http://www.angelfire.com/rings/firstwarofthering/TheRealVariags.html | accessdate = 2007-06-16 }}</ref> Khand allies with the Easterlings frequently.
*'''[[Bestiary of Middle-earth|Monsters of Middle-earth]]''' (Evil) - This applies to individual models that do not fit into other armies; in this case, the five creatures that each "represents a fantasy archetype - stone giant, dragon, cave drake and fire demon (the Balrog)."<ref name="WD326"/> The fifth was a purely Games Workshop creation: "Gûlavhar, the Terror of Arnor" - a "vampire" demon of Morgoth, but lesser than a [[Balrog]].<ref name="WD326"/> The Monsters of Middle-earth can ally with most evil forces.<ref name="LOME">''Legions of Middle-earth''</ref>

===Additional Characters===

Games Workshop has taken the liberty to fill in gaps in Tolkien's works by creating new heroes and units alike. Some are heavily criticized, such as the Isengard Troll,<ref name="isentroll"/> having been described as "not thematically correct";<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Cheeseweb Monthly | volume = 5 | pages = 49 | title = Cheeseweb Newsletter | work = E-zine | publisher = Cheesweb | url = http://www.freewebs.com/cwmonthly/cwmonthly5b.pdf | accessdate = 2007-07-10 }}</ref> whilst others have been popular additions.

*'''Cirion''' - Named after the steward of Gondor that gave Rohan to Eorl the Young, Game Workshop's interpretation of Cirion is the lieutenant of Amon Barad. 
*'''Mardin''' - A Dwarf character. He is a member of the vault warden tunnel fighting teams, and is Durin's personal bodyguard.
*'''Múrin and Drár''' - A duo of wandering Dwarves.
*'''Durbûrz''' - Also known as the Goblin King of Moria, Durbûrz is clearly an interpretation of a descendant of the [[Great Goblin]].
*'''Buhrdûr''' - A Hill Troll Chieftain. Buhrdûr is the leader of the Trolls that were part of ''[[Ruin of Arnor|The Ruin of Arnor]]''. In [[Rise of the witch-king|The Battle for Middle Earth II, The Rise of the Witch-king]], by EA games, a similar character, Rogash, appears. This may or may not be an interpretation of the same character.
*'''Vraskû''' - Vraskû is an Uruk-hai scout captain, armed with a prototype crossbow. He is considered overpowered, especially when compared to [[Lurtz]].
*'''Keiseimu, Ravager of Ithilien''' - A Khandish hero. So far, all that is known about him is his name and the fact that he can be given a chariot to ride to battle.
*'''[[Serpent Lord|Suladân, the Serpent Lord]]''' - While the Serpent Lord is mentioned in the books, Tolkien left him unnamed. Games Workshop made up a character that bears the title of the Serpent Lord, but is completely created by Games Workshop otherwise.
*'''Hâsharin''' - An order of Haradrim [[assassin]]s.
*'''Dalamyr, Fleetmaster of Umbar''' - A Corsair character.
*'''Gûlavhar, the Terror of Arnor''' - A vampire demon of [[Morgoth]], similar to a balrog. It is listed under ''Monsters of Middle-Earth'' and unique so far.

On [[June 1]] [[2005]], Games Workshop launched their annual [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based [[Games Workshop#Worldwide Campaigns|Worldwide Campaign]] under the name "[[The War of the Ring Online Campaign]]", featuring The Lord of the Rings for the first time. The Campaign was deemed "a fantastic rollercoaster", with 3007 registered participants.<ref name="War of the Ring">Alessio Cavatore, "Victory for the Free Peoples". ''[[United Kingdom|UK]] [[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]] 312'', p 98-99</ref> Games Workshop also introduced the "Wrath of [[Umbar]] Roadshow", with custom-built [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsair]] models and gaming boards being brought to various cities in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Wrath of Umbar | publisher = Games Workshop | url = http://thewarofthering.uk.games-workshop.com/events/umbar/1/ | accessdate = 2007-07-03 }}</ref> When the Campaign formally ended on [[September 8]], Good emerged the victor.<ref name="War of the Ring"/> The combined total of the 14 weeks was 27239 recorded wargames.<ref name="War of the Ring"/> The Forum closed shortly after, giving way to a smaller [[Canada]]-based Campaign with the same name.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://thewarofthering.ca.games-workshop.com/warnews/ | title = War of the Ring Canada | accessdate = 2007-07-03|}}</ref>

Hobby websites have been key in organising sides in the Worldwide Campaigns, and indeed in creating their own campaigns and competitions,<ref>For example: {{cite web | last = | title = One Ring Awards | work = Competition | publisher = The One Ring | date = | url = http://www.one-ring.co.uk/phpBB2/competition.php?mode=cat | accessdate = 2007-05-21 }}</ref> such as the "''Campaign of LoTRs''", run by ''The Dark Council'' and ''Cheeseweb''.

Another notable side of the community is the influence of its reaction to the company's products: many [[Middle-earth canon|Tolkien purists]], for example, reacted against the company's rendition of the Swan Knights of [[Dol Amroth]], with some choosing to [[miniature conversion|convert]] their own,<ref>For example: {{cite web | last = Revolutionary | title = Alternative Knights of Dol Amroth | work = Article | publisher = The Palantir | date = | url = http://www.thepalantir.org/ca/miniature/rev003/rev003.html | accessdate = 2007-05-14 }}<br>{{cite web | last = Clarkmonster | title = Dol Amroth Army | work = Forum WIP | publisher = The One Ring | date = [[2007-01-11]] | url = http://www.one-ring.co.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=9163 | accessdate = 2007-05-14 }}</ref> impacting the hobby and the sales of the products.<ref>[http://www.gamingreport.com/article.php?thold=-1&mode=flat&order=0&sid=16662 2005 Report]</ref> When Games Workshop subsequently showed the planned release of the [[Man-at-arms|Men-at-Arms]] of Dol Amroth, it was suggested that they had taken the response of the community into account.<ref>{{cite web | last =  | title = Discussion of Men-at-Arms of Dol Amroth | work = Forums | publisher = The Last Alliance | date = [[2007-05-11]] | url = http://www.thelastalliance.com/index.php?pid=view_replies&thread_id=52825&forum_id=59 | accessdate = 2007-05-14 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = NumenoreanLord | title = Discussion of Men-at-Arms of Dol Amroth | work = Forums | publisher = The Last Alliance | date = [[2007-05-12]] | url = http://www.one-ring.co.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=104285#104285 | accessdate = 2007-05-14 }}</ref>
