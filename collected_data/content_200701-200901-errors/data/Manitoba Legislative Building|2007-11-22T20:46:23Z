The '''Manitoba Legislative Building''' is the meeting place of the [[Legislative Assembly of Manitoba]]<ref name="History">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>, in central [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]].  It was originally named the Manitoba Parliament Building, not Legislative<ref name="History">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>.  The neoclassical building was completed in 1920 and stands seventy-seven meters tall (253 ft)<ref name="History">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>.  It was designed and built by Frank Worthington Simon<ref name="Simon">"[http://www.codexgeo.co.uk/dsa/architect_full.php?id=M000057 Frank Lewis Worthington Simon]", at Dictionary of Scottish Architects.</ref> and Henry Boddington III, along with other Masons and many skilled craftsmen.  Frank Simon (1862-1933) was a former student at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]]<ref name="Simon">"[http://www.codexgeo.co.uk/dsa/architect_full.php?id=M000057 Frank Lewis Worthington Simon]", at Dictionary of Scottish Architects.</ref> which taught students [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] [[art]], [[architecture]], [[geometry]], [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[engraving]], [[philosophy]], [[astronomy]], and [[mythology]]<ref name="Simon">"[http://www.codexgeo.co.uk/dsa/architect_full.php?id=M000057 Frank Lewis Worthington Simon]", at Dictionary of Scottish Architects.</ref>.  The building is famous for the [[Golden Boy (Manitoba)|Golden Boy]], a gold covered bronze statue based on the style of the Roman god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], or the Greek god [[Hermes]], at the top of the [[cupola]], or domed ceiling.

== History and construction ==

In 1911, the [[Manitoba]] government announced an architectural competition to all architects in the [[British Empire]], with a grand prize of $10,000 was offered for the best design for the new Manitoba Legislative Building<ref name="History">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. The third building used by Manitoba's legislative assembly<ref name="History">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. The first, the home of [[Andrew Bannatyne|A.G.B. Bannatyne]], the second stood on the same grounds as the current Legislative building<ref name="History">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. Of the 67 submissions, Frank Worthington Simon, a former student at the [[Ecole des Beaux-Arts]], had his design chosen for the construction of the impressive structure<ref name="History">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref><ref name="Simon">"[http://www.codexgeo.co.uk/dsa/architect_full.php?id=M000057 Frank Lewis Worthington Simon]", at Dictionary of Scottish Architects.</ref>. 

Construction began in 1913, with Tyndall stone, quarried at Garson, about 20 kilometers northeast of [[Winnipeg]]<ref name="History">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. On June 3, 1914 the north-east cornerstone ceremony, which was commonly done by [[masonry|masons]], was laid by Thomas Kelly, the contractor.  Due to [[World War I]] in 1914 causing a shortage of material, labor and funds, the construction of the massive building was slowed and was not ready for partial occupancy until 1919<ref name="History">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. On [[July 15]], [[1920]], the province's 50th anniversary date, opening ceremonies were performed by [[James Albert Manning Aikins|Sir James Aikins]], then Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba<ref name="History">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>.

The base of the building forms the letter ''H''<ref name="History">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. The total square footage of the building is 250,000 square feet, with a total height of 242 feet above ground level toped with a 21.5-karat gold statue of the Greek God [[Hermes]] or the Romans God [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]<ref name="History">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. The Legislative grounds cover 30 acres of landscaped grounds<ref name="History">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. Throughout the exterior and interior of the building are examples of [[Fibonacci Sequence]], [[Golden Ratio]] and [[Sacred Geometry]].

== Exterior ==

[[Image:GoldenBoyWinnipeg.JPG|thumb|right|The Golden Boy, "Eternal Youth", or Mercury]]

Coming up to the north side of the Legislative Building, above the 6 main [[column]]s, is the main [[pediment]]<ref name="Exterior">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/exterior.html The Exterior]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. In the bottom-left corner of the pediment is the [[Indolent]] Man, with a half-kneeling woman, the spirit of progress, beckoning the Indolent Man into the new land of promise<ref name="Exterior">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/exterior.html The Exterior]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. Next is the [[goddess]] [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] leading a bull, symbolizing Canada's [[European ethnic groups|European]] heritage and immigration<ref name="Exterior">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/exterior.html The Exterior]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>.  To the right of Europa, a man, woman and child symbolizing the colonization of a new land<ref name="Exterior">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/exterior.html The Exterior]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. Seated in the center is Lady Manitoba with the rays of the sun behind her<ref name="Exterior">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/exterior.html The Exterior]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>.  She closely resembles the fertility goddesses [[Ishtar]] and [[Demeter]], both patron deities of agriculture, with [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]'s trident symbolizing the [[Pacific Ocean]], and to the left and to the right are ships wheels symbolizing the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Next to the right of Lady Manitoba are a man and a woman laden with wheat and fruit, products of the soil<ref name="Exterior">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/exterior.html The Exterior]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>.  Then next is a muscular male figure with a team of powerful horses and a primitive plow tilling the soil<ref name="Exterior">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/exterior.html The Exterior]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. Finally in the bottom right corner are two entwined female figures representing the [[Red River of the North|Red]] and [[Assiniboine River]]s<ref name="Exterior">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/exterior.html The Exterior]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>.

Above the main pediment, flanking both sides are two Egyptian [[sphinx]]es facing both east and west<ref name="Exterior">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/exterior.html The Exterior]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. Carved onto a flat piece of stone, just below the chin, in Egyptian [[hieroglyph]]ics, is "The everlasting manifestation of the Sun God [[Ra]], the good God who gives life."

Each one of the four corners of the copper dome supporting the [[Golden Boy (Manitoba)|Golden Boy]] has a stonework grouping representing the four elements of [[alchemy]], [[Classical element|earth, air, fire and water]]. They are identified as [[Agriculture]], [[Science]], [[Industry]] and [[Art]]<ref name="Exterior">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/exterior.html The Exterior]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. The dome is 223 feet 7 inches above the main floor. The height of the central tower without the Golden Boy is 242 feet. The Golden Boy was sculpted by [[Georges Gardet]] and cast in bronze at the Barbidienne foundry in France in 1918.<ref name="Golden">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/golden.html Golden Boy]", at the  ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref> Modeled after the 16th century sculpture of Mercury by [[Giovanni da Bologna]]. The true name of the Golden Boy is "Eternal Youth". Originally painted gold, "Eternal Youth" was gilded in 1951 in 23.5-karat gold leaf. He stands 17.2 feet tall from toe to torch<ref name="Golden" /> and weighs 1,650 kg (3,640 pounds).<ref name="Golden" /> He carries a sheaf of golden grain in his left arm,<ref name="Golden" /> while his right hand holds high a torch.<ref name="Golden" /> The gold is a symbol of alchemy and those who searched for ways to turn lead into gold.

On both the east and west [[portico]]s sit figures representing war and peace. On the east side, with engraved images of weapons of war, are two male figures, one a native warrior with an eagle [[head-dress]], another a [[Roman army|Roman soldier]], and on the west side there are two female figures for peace. Each pair guards a chest, rumored to represent the [[Ark of the Covenant]] because of the proper proportions as mentioned in the ancient Hebrew texts.

The figure was sculpted by Charles Gardet of Paris, and cast in 1918 at the Barbidienne foundry in France. The foundry was partially destroyed by bombs during the First World War, but the Golden Boy emerged unharmed. The figure was rushed to a seaport and put aboard a French ship carrying wheat. Before the ship could put out to sea, it was commandeered for the transport of troops.

 The boy lay in the hold of the ship, travelling many miles, constantly in danger. When the war was over, the figure arrived at Halifax and was shipped to Winnipeg and finally hoisted to the top of Manitoba's then-new Legislative Building.

== Grand Staircase ==

[[Image:grandstairnorth.jpg|thumb|left|The Grand Staircase, North side]]
[[Image:grandstairsouth.jpg|thumb|right|The Grand Staircase, South side]]

Within the main entrance is the Grand Staircase.  This is a perfectly square room measuring 66.6 feet on each side, which is meant to represent the numerological number [[666 (number)|666]], which are all the numbers added from one to 36, which is the square of 6, in [[mathematics]], [[geometry]], and [[arithmetic]]. The stair case is composed of three flights of steps each with [[13]] steps.<ref name="Grand">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/grand.html The Interior]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref> The steps are brown-veined Carrara marble,<ref name="Grand" /> the finest marble in the world.  Flanking the steps are life size [[North American bison]].<ref name="Grand" /> Made of solid [[bronze]],<ref name="Grand" /> they were modeled by Charles Gardet, creator of the [[Golden Boy]],<ref name="Golden" /> and cast at the Roman Bronze Works in [[New York City]].<ref name="Grand" /> Each bison weighs 2,268 kilograms (2½ tons).<ref name="Grand" /> Legend has it that to install the bison safely without damaging the marble floors, the main entrance was flooded and left to freeze. Both bison were then placed on enormous slabs of ice cut from the Assiniboine River, and safely slid into the building.<ref name="Grand" /> The bison are one example of [[apotropaic]] icons in the Grand Staircase. 

The bison, a symbol of the Province of Manitoba, are meant to represent the sacred bulls which guard temple entrances. Above the south entrance to the legislature lobby is the [[Medusa]]'s head, and over the north entrance facing Medusa is the bust of [[Athena]], Greek goddess of war, embodiment of democracy and also the protector of cities.  Around the perimeter of the room are 14 lion heads and 8 cattle skulls at the edge of the ceiling.  Around the second floor balcony, lamps rise from the [[balustrade]]s,<ref name="Grand" /> each containing 13 bulbs, 12 around 1 (Twelve Apostles and Jesus). The third floor facing the Grand Staircase is supported by two pairs of columns, reproductions of the [[caryatids]],<ref name="Grand" /> sculpted female figures serving as an architectural support taking the place of a column or a pillar. Each figure holds a scroll and key. The figures located on the third floor were sculpted by the Piccirilli Brothers of New York,<ref name="Grand" /> using models prepared by Albert Hodge of [[London]], England. The ceiling is made of a glass atrium to allow natural sunlight to illuminate the room.<ref name="Grand" />

== Rotunda ==

[[Image:Rotundanorth.jpg|thumb|left|Rotunda, North side]]
[[Image:Rotundasouth.jpg|thumb|right|Rotunda, South side]]

The antechamber at the head of the grand staircase provides a formal approach to the legislative chamber<ref name="Rotunda">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The Rotunda]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. 8 [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns rise from the floor to the [[cornice]] surrounding the base of the dome<ref name="Rotunda">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The Rotunda]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. Between each pair of columns are busts of [[Hermes]]. The floor of the dome rotunda is [[Tennessee]] marble bordered with black Vermont and verde antique marble<ref name="Rotunda">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The Rotunda]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. The height to the eye of the dome is 87 feet and the diameter is 54 feet. Within the dome above are four panels containing 5 gold rosettes. In the center of the [[Rotunda]] is an [[Italian culture|Italian]] marble balustrade 13 feet across surrounding the Pool of the Black Star on the floor of the level below, a representation of the altars of the ancient Greeks.  The diameter of the circle above the balustrade is also 13 feet, and both align with the Golden Boy above these.  Above the doorway to the Manitoba Assembly is a mural by [[Frank Brangwyn]] depicting World War I<ref name="Rotunda">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The Rotunda]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. In the center of the painting is a man in tattered rags with his left chest and arm exposed, being helped along by a comrade. Above the men are a faint depiction of [[The Madonna]] and child.

== Pool of the Black Star ==

[[Image:PoolBlackStar.jpg|thumb|right|Pool of the Black Star]]

The Pool of the Black Star is the room below the [[Rotunda]] with four entrances and marked by 3 steps forming a circumference of the room. The room is a perfect circle with a radius of 27 feet, and the number 27 is the cube of 3 in geometry.  Carved in marble on the floor is an 8 pointed star. Directly above in alignment with the Pool of the Black Star is the dome of the building on which the Golden Boy is mounted. The alignment of the two markers is one degree off the longitudinal center of Canada. The Black Star is said to represent the underworld of [[Ishtar]] and the Golden Boy, Hermes, is the messenger of the Heavens. The design of the building allows sounds and harmonics from all over the building to be caught, distorted, and magnified in the circular room at the star. The design of the Pool is so perfect that when you stand at the centre of the star and speak you can hear your own echo returning to you from all directions equally and if you whistle up to the golden boy a perfect harmonic 5th is created (the sound of Hermes).

== Lieutenant-Governor's Reception Room ==

In the east corridor of the Manitoba Legislative Building is the Lieutenant-Governor's Reception Room. This finely decorated room is used by the [[Lieutenant-Governor]] on state occasions to receive visiting royalty and foreign dignitaries and general public is barred from entry. During such events, scarlet-coated [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] are posted on either side of the door and military aides assist the Lieutenant-Governor with official duties. The room is paneled in black American [[walnut]] inlaid with ebony, and decorated with hand-carved ornaments around the ceiling and along the four corner pillars.  Pictures of sovereigns grace the walls and a French gilt [[chandelier]] hangs from the ceiling. The floor features a carpet specially handwoven in [[Donegal]], [[Ireland]]. Facing across from each other on the north and south wall are two elaborate mirrors in gilt frames. The room measures 24 feet in both directions. Directly above the Lieutenant-Governor's Reception Room are the two male warriors (War), one native in full eagle feathered head dress, and one Roman, guarding the representation of the [[Ark of the Covenant]].

== Legislative Chamber ==

[[Image:LegChamber.jpg|thumb|left|The Legislative Chamber]]

The [[Legislative Assembly of Manitoba]] and the Lieutenant Governor form the Legislature of Manitoba, the legislative branch of government in the Canadian [[Province of Manitoba]]. Fifty-seven members are elected to this assembly in provincial general elections, all in single-member constituencies with first-past-the-post voting<ref name="Chamber">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. Originally, in 1870, there were 24 Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs)<ref name="Chamber">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>.  As the province grew in population and size, more electoral divisions were added<ref name="Chamber">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>.  Winnipeg was once the third largest city in Canada, and often named Chicago of the North<ref name="Chamber">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>.

Manitoba's Legislative chamber is unique among Provincial Legislatures in that the Members' benches are grouped in a horseshoe shape<ref name="Chamber">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. The Speaker's Chair of the House is located on the south wall below the press gallery of 13 seats<ref name="Chamber">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>.  All debate is addressed to the Speaker, who rules on points of order and procedure and has the responsibility of maintaining order and [[decorum]].

When the Legislature is in session, each day begins in accordance with procedures that have origins in the early beginnings of Parliamentary rule<ref name="Chamber">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. The speaker enters the Legislative Chamber followed by the clerks of the Legislative Assembly and preceded by the Sergeant-at-arms bearing the Manitoba's Mace<ref name="Chamber">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>.

The original desks and chairs of the Chamber are fashioned of walnut with inlaid ebony<ref name="Chamber">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. They are arranged in three tiers rising from a sunken floor in the center of the Chamber<ref name="Chamber">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. Each desk is equipped with a microphone connected to a public address system and a recording machine used in the publication of Hansard, a verbatim report of debates and proceedings in the Legislature<ref name="Chamber">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. During question period, translators provide simultaneous translation from French to English<ref name="Chamber">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. The Chamber is also equipped for video and internet broadcasts of question period and special events such as throne and budget speeches<ref name="Chamber">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. Yet even as such changes have brought the assembly into the future, the original inkwells employed by an earlier generation of Manitoban politicians are still visible<ref name="Chamber">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legchamber.html The Legislative Chamber]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>. To the right of the speaker is a statue of [[Moses]] holding the [[Ten Commandments]], to the left is [[Solon]], a famous lawmaker of ancient [[Athens]]. Each statue is made of bronze and sculpted by Gardet.

== Today ==

The Manitoba Legislative Building is by far the most expensive building in Manitoba, and it is irreplaceable.  The cost of construction today would be impossible, especially considering the lack of very skilled mason workers that would be capable enough<ref name="History">"[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legtour/legbld.html The History]", at the ''Legislative Tour'', Province of Manitoba.</ref>.

A very popular book was published in 2007 entitled ''The Hermetic Code'', by [[Frank Albo]]<ref>{{cite book
  | last = Albo
  | first = Frank
  | title = The Hermetic Code
  | publisher = Winnipeg Free Press
  | date = April 2007
  | id = ISBN 0968257534}}</ref>, which uncovers a lot of the Masonic and classical history incorporated into the building.
