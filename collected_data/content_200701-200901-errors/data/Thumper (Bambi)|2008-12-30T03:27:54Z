'''Thumper''' is a fictional [[rabbit]] character from [[Disney]]'s animated movie ''[[Bambi]]''.  He appeared again in ''[[Bambi II]]''.  He is known and named for his habit of thumping his left hind foot.  Thumper also appears at the [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] as a [[meetable character]].

The character was an important influence upon the development of the movie [[Bambi]] which started production with an adult tone which seemed too serious and uncommercial.  As voiced by the young actor, four-year-old [[Peter Behn]], the vivacious character of Thumper was expanded from its original minor role and led to a focus upon the young animals in the story.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.rochester.edu/in_visible_culture/Issue_9/roth.html|author=Matthew Roth|year=2005|journal=Invisible Culture|issue=9|title=Man is in the Forest}}</ref>

The visual appearance of the character was based upon [[Beatrix Potter]]'s drawings of [[Benjamin Bunny]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nW2RGQAACAAJ|title=Once Upon a Time Walt Disney|author=Bruno Girveau|year=2006|isbn=3791361066}}</ref> Unlike real rabbits, Thumper is drawn with paw pads, a feature that rabbits lack.

==Film appearances == 
The character Thumper first appears in the film ''Bambi'', watching as [[Bambi (character)|Bambi]] is first presented as the young prince to the creatures of the forest.  He remarks that Bambi is "kinda wobbly" but is reproved by his mother who makes him repeat what his father had impressed upon him that morning, "If you can't say something nice, don't say nothing at all".<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qcZ3fM4iLo4C&pg=PT110&dq=Thumper+nice+say&lr=&sig=ACfU3U2thgrK4a_-GJtAsxVBWzrDZoMlDA#PPT111,M1|title=Still Living, Still Learning|author=June Titus|publisher=Kregel Publications|year=2000|isbn=0825438241}}</ref>  This moral is now known by such names as the "Thumperian principle", "Thumper's rule" or "Thumper's law".<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gJumTAl78LUC|title=Complex Problem Solving|author=Robert J.

A few days later a still-wobbly Bambi was out with his mother when they re-encountered Thumper, who took it upon himself to teach the fawn various tricks, notably that of speech.  He succeeded in teaching Bambi a few words, notably "flower" which Bambi accidentally used to name a young [[skunk]].  Thumper tried to correct Bambi but the skunk said, "That's alright.  He can call me Flower if he wants to. I don't mind".  The three animals go on to become friends and this encounter provides another moral lesson in the virtues of tolerance and an easy disposition.<ref>{{citation|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YGtbYTyulb4C|pages=46–47|title=The Gospel According to Disney|author=Mark I. Pinsky|isbn=0664225918}}</ref>

In ''[[Bambi II]]'', Thumper again appears hiding from his sisters and trying to help Bambi learn to be brave in the hopes of impressing his dad. Thumper is the main protagonist in a video storybook, ''Thumper Goes Exploring'', which was released with the [[Walt Disney Platinum Editions|Platinum Edition]]  of Bambi on March 1, 2005.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/01/movies/HomeVideo/01dvd.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/R/Recordings%20(Audio)&pagewanted=all&position=|title=New DVD's|author=Dave Kehr|date=March 1, 2005|publisher=New York Times}}</ref>

Thumper also makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' along with Bambi. He is also mentioned as Roger Rabbit's uncle in one scene of the film.

==Metaphorical usage==
''Thumper'' is used as a metaphor for a cuddly pet when referring to women.<ref>{{citation|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ReUcy1-XmHIC|pages=286|title=Gender Articulated|author=Kira Hall, Mary Bucholtz|chapter=Bitches and Skankly Hobags|isbn=0415913985|year=1995}}</ref>  U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] had two secretaries called "Bambi" and "Thumper" with whom he engaged in casual affairs.<ref>{{citation|url=http://human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/pap142h.html|author=Romert M. Young|title=The Psychodynamic of eminence, success, being well-known and being a celebrity|accessdate=2 August 2008}}</ref>  "'Bambi" and "Thumper" are also the names of two female bodyguards in the James Bond movie ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''.

The name was used for a project by the [[General Electric Company]] which looked at ways to defend the USA against [[ballistic missile]]s, such as the [[V-2 rocket|V2]], which were used by Germany in [[World War II]].  This subsequently led to the [[United States Air Force]] program BAMBI &ndash; BAllistic Missile Boost Intercept.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj87/win87/papp.html|title=From Project Thumper to SDI|author=Dr Daniel S.
