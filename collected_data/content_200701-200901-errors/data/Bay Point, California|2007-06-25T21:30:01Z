==History==
Bay Point was previously known by several names including Bella Vista and West Pittsburg.  In 1993 a vote was held by the League of Women Voters in response to the bad reputation the area had gained, including a front page article in which a Sheriff's Deputy decried West Pittsburg as a cesspool.  Those over the age of 18 were allowed to vote on renaming the area Bay Point.

Hard feelings about the name change were evident and vandalism did occur, mainly on the sign welcoming you to town, in which the words Bay Point were crossed out.  The sign now proclaims "Welcome to our Community" and in recent years (as more people have moved into town and harsh feelings have died down) Bay Point was added to the bottom part of the sign.
