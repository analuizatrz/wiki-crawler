'''''Raiders of the Lost Ark''''', also known as '''''Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark''''', is a [[1981 in film|1981]], [[Academy Award]]-winning [[adventure film]] directed by [[Steven Spielberg]]. It is the first installment of the Indiana Jones series. The story introduces [[archaeology|archaeologist]] and adventurer [[Indiana Jones]] ([[Harrison Ford]]), who is hired by the U.S. government to go on a quest for the mystical lost [[Ark of the Covenant]]. Accompanied by his old friend [[Sallah]] ([[John Rhys-Davies]]) and ex-flame [[Marion Ravenwood]] ([[Karen Allen]]), he must retrieve the ark before the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and his adversary, [[France|French]] archaeologist  [[Rene Belloq]] ([[Paul Freeman]]) acquire it first. 

The original film sparked waves of interest in old [[1930s]] style [[cliffhanger]] serials, leading to two more films (''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''), pre-production of a fourth film (to be released in 2008), and ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' television series.

== Synopsis ==
{{Spoiler}}
In 1936, in a South American jungle, archaeologist Indiana Jones braves through several booby traps to retrieve a golden [[idolatry|idol]] from an ancient temple. After escaping a rolling boulder, he finds rival archaeologist Rene Belloq waiting outside the cave with a small group of armed natives. Surrounded and outnumbered, Jones is forced to give up the [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] to Belloq, but he escapes. Back at the college where he teaches, Jones meets with two [[United States Army|US Army]] intelligence agents. They explain that the Nazis, in their quest to gain occult power, are searching for Abner Ravenwood, Jones’ former mentor. Ravenwood is the foremost expert on the [[ancient Egypt]]ian city of [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanis]], which has been re-discovered by the Nazis and is believed to be the location of the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. Jones surmises that the Nazis seek Ravenwood because he possesses the headpiece to the Staff of Ra, a key artifact which is essential in calculating the Ark’s resting place. His colleague [[Marcus Brody]] explains that, according to legend, the power of the Ark can make any army invincible.

Jones flies to [[Nepal]], only to find that Ravenwood has died. His daughter Marion, Jones' bitter former love interest, has the headpiece. After a gunfight between Jones and a sadistic Nazi agent named [[Toht]], Marion's tavern burns down. Toht's hand is scarred with the face of the medallion after trying to pick it up amid the flames. Jones ends up with both the headpiece and Marion, who decides to travel with him. The two fly to [[Cairo]] and meet up with Sallah, a skilled Egyptian digger. Sallah says that he knows where they are digging for the Ark, and that Belloq is working for the Nazis. Nazi operatives quickly kidnap Marion. That evening, Sallah and Jones get the headpiece deciphered. Based on this translation, they realize the Nazis are digging in the wrong place, so they still have a chance to find the Ark.
[[Image:Maproom.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Indiana Jones]] ([[Harrison Ford]]) uses the Staff of [[Ra]] to discover the location of the Ark]] 
Infiltrating the dig, Indy and Sallah gather a small crew and begin to dig at the correct location. After several hours, they break through the roof of the buried Well of Souls. Jones is lowered to the floor of the temple and finds it infested with deadly snakes, which he is deathly afraid of. After he and Sallah hoist the Ark out of the temple, Belloq and the Nazis take it away, and leave Jones stranded inside the temple. To Belloq's regret, they throw Marion in as well and seal the opening. The duo manage to escape, emerging aboveground in time to find a [[Luftwaffe]] [[flying wing]] being prepared to transport the Ark to [[Berlin]]. They accidentally blow up the plane, so Belloq and Dietrich put the Ark on a truck to Cairo, where it will be shipped to Berlin. Stealing a horse, Jones pursues the convoy escorting the truck, seizes control of the vehicle and after a extended pursuit, escapes with the Ark. That evening, Jones and Marion leave Sallah and escort the Ark to England onboard the [[tramp steamer]] ''Bantu Wind''.

The next morning, a Nazi [[U-boat]] commandeered by Belloq and Dietrich stops the ship. Jones avoids capture, but Marion and the Ark are removed. Jones covertly boards the U-boat, and steals a soldier's uniform and a rocket launcher. He follows Belloq and the Ark to an isolated canyon, where they plan to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to the Fuhrer. Threatening to destroy the Ark with a rocket, Jones demands that the Nazis free Marion. Belloq calls his bluff, and he is forced to surrender. Marion and Jones are tied up while Belloq and the Nazis perform a ceremonial opening of the Ark. Strange glowing spirits emerge from within, and Jones, now fully aware of the supernatural danger of  looking at the open Ark, warns Marion to close her eyes. The spirits proceed to kill the entire group of Nazis (including Dietrich and Toht) and Belloq by melting their faces and making them explode, and after clearing the area and freeing Jones and Marion of their bonds, the Ark closes itself once more with a crack of thunder.

Back in Washington D.C., the two Army intelligence men tell a suspicious Jones that "top men" are carefully studying the Ark. However, it is shown that the artifact is sealed in a wooden crate marked 'top secret' and stored in a giant [[Government Warehouse|government warehouse]], filled with countless other similar crates.

==Production==
===Conception===
In 1973, [[George Lucas]] wrote ''The Adventures of Indiana Smith''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hearn | first = Marcus | title = The Cinema of George Lucas | publisher =Harry N. Abrams Inc. | date = 2005 | location =[[New York City]] | pages =80 | id =ISBN 0-8109-4968-7}}</ref> Like ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]],'' he saw it as an opportunity to create a modern version of the [[movie serial|serials]] of the 1930s and 1940s. Calling Indiana his "dream figure", he wrote four stories about the archaeologist.<ref name="mcbride">{{cite book | last = McBride | first =Joseph | authorlink =Joseph McBride | title = Steven Spielberg | publisher =Faber and Faber | date =1997 | location =[[New York City]] | pages =309-322 | id = ISBN 0-571-19177-0 |chapter=Rehab}}</ref> Lucas discussed the concept with [[Philip Kaufman]], who worked with him for several weeks and came up with the [[Ark of the Covenant]] as the [[plot device]]. The project was stalled when [[Clint Eastwood]] hired Kaufman to direct ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]''.<ref name="smith">Hearn, p.112-115</ref> 

In late May 1977, Lucas was in [[Maui]], trying to escape the enormous success of ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]''. Friend and colleague [[Steven Spielberg]] was also there, holidaying from work on ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]''. Whilst building a [[sand castle]], Spielberg expressed an interest in directing a [[James Bond]] film. Lucas convinced his friend Spielberg that he had conceived a character "better than James Bond" and explained the concept of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''. Spielberg loved it, calling it "a James Bond film without the hardware",<ref name="mcbride"/> though he had the character's [[surname]] changed to "Jones".<ref name="smith"/> 

The following year Lucas focused on developing ''Raiders'' and the ''Star Wars'' sequel ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back]]'', during which [[Lawrence Kasdan]] and [[Frank Marshall (movie producer)|Frank Marshall]] joined the project as screenwriter and producer respectively. Between [[January 23]]-[[January 27|27]] [[1978]] for nine hours daily, Lucas, Kasdan and Spielberg discussed the story and visual ideas. Spielberg came up with Jones being chased by a [[boulder]], and Lucas came up with a [[submarine]], a monkey giving the [[Nazi salute]] and a girl slugging Jones in [[Nepal]].<ref name="mcbride"/> Kasdan used a 100 page transcript of their conversations for his first script draft,<ref>Hearn, p.122-123</ref> working for six months.<ref name="mcbride"/> Ultimately some of their ideas were too grand: Kasdan cut out a mine chase, an escape from a museum in [[Shanghai]] and a jump from an airplane in a raft into a river. Elements of these would resurface in the sequel.<ref name="mcbride"/> Spielberg and Lucas disagreed on the character: although Lucas saw him as a Bondian playboy, Kasdan and Spielberg felt the professor and adventurer elements of the character made him complex enough. Spielberg had darker visions of Jones, interpreting him as an [[alcoholic]] similar to [[Humphrey Bogart]]'s character Fred C. Dobbs in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]''. This characterisation fell away during the later drafts.<ref name="mcbride"/> Comic book artist [[Jim Steranko]] was also commissioned to produce original illustrations for pre-production, which heavily influenced Spielberg's decisions in both the look of the film and the character of Indiana Jones himself.

As ''The Empire Strikes Back'' began post-production in September 1979, Lucas began to find a [[distribution]] deal for ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''.<ref name="lucas prod">Hearn, p.127-134</ref> Studios were reluctant following Spielberg's flop ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'', unable to believe he could bring the film for $20 million which they would have to pay for.<ref name="mcbride"/> They also balked at simply distributing the film whilst the filmmakers took a larger share of box office receipts<ref name="lucas prod"/> and full ownership of the film.<ref name="mcbride"/> Eventually [[Paramount Pictures]] under [[Michael Eisner]] accepted,<ref name="lucas prod"/> on condition of making at least four sequels with [[Lucasfilm]].<ref name="mcbride"/> By April 1980, Kasdan's fifth draft was produced, and production was getting ready to shoot at [[Elstree Studios]], with Lucas trying to keep costs down.<ref name="lucas prod"/> With four illustrators, ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' was Spielberg's most [[storyboard]]ed film of his career to date, further helping the film economically,<ref name="mcbride"/> and he and Lucas agreed on a tight schedule to stylistically follow the "quick and dirty" feel of the Saturday matinee serials.

What was left to do was to cast [[Indiana Jones]]. Spielberg suggested casting [[Harrison Ford]] as Jones, but Lucas objected, stating that he didn't want Ford to become his "[[Robert De Niro|Bobby DeNiro]]" or "that guy I put in all my movies."<ref>{{cite video|title=Indiana Jones: Making the Trilogy|format=DVD|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]]|date=2003}}</ref> Desiring a lesser known actor, Lucas convinced Spielberg to help him search for a new talent, and the actor they both became keen for was [[Tom Selleck]], who possessed features similar to Ford's and a much larger physical frame. However, Selleck was unavailable for the part because of his commitment to the television series ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]''.<ref name="lucas prod"/> In June 1980, three weeks away from filming,<ref name="facts and trivia">{{cite web|title=Facts and trivia of the Lost Ark|publisher=Official website|date=[[2003-10-14]]|url=http://www.indianajones.com/raiders/bts/news/news20031014.html|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> Spielberg convinced Lucas to offer the role to Ford after Marshall and fellow producer [[Kathleen Kennedy (movie producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] were impressed by his performance as [[Han Solo]] in ''The Empire Strikes Back''.<ref name="lucas prod"/> Ford accepted.

===Filming===
{{spoilers}}
Filming began on [[June 23]] [[1980]] at [[La Rochelle]], [[France]], for scenes involving the Nazi submarine.<ref name="lucas prod"/> Lucas "borrowed" the submarine that was going to be used in ''[[Das Boot]]''.<ref name="world">{{cite web|author=Marco Fromter|title=Around the World with Indiana Jones|publisher=Official Website|date=[[2006-08-18]]|url=http://www.indianajones.com/raiders/bts/news/f20060818/index.html|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> The crew moved to [[Elstree Studios]]<ref name="lucas prod"/> for scenes involving the [[Well of Souls]], opening interiors and [[Marion Ravenwood]]'s bar.<ref name="world"/> 

They  moved to [[Tunisia]], which stood in for [[Egypt]].<ref name="lucas prod"/> [[Sallah]]'s entrance was filmed in [[Kairouan]].<ref name="world"/> The scene where Indiana Jones shoots the sword-wielding assassin (played by [[Terry Richards (actor)|Terry Richards]]) in the market was improvised on the set. Harrison Ford had been suffering from [[dysentery]] and exhaustion due to the extreme heat of [[Tunisia]] during filming.  As originally planned, the scene was elaborately choreographed, with Jones facing the expert swordsman and trying to defeat him with just his whip. Some footage of the planned fight was shot (and was seen in at least one of the movie's trailers) but the filming was proving to be very tedious, both for Ford and the crew, and at some point Ford had had enough. Reportedly, he said something to Spielberg along the lines of, "Why don't we just shoot the sucker?" Spielberg liked the idea, scrapped the rest of the fight scene, and filmed the brief sequence of the shooting that appears in the movie.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Urban Legends of Indiana Jones|publisher=Official website|date=[[2004-01-13]]|url=http://www.indianajones.com/raiders/bts/news/f20040113/index.html|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> Producer [[Frank Marshall]] also endured three days of heat as a cockpit pilot for one scene.

The scene in which Jones threatens Belloq with a rocket-propelled grenade was shot in the same Tunisian canyon where George Lucas shot a scene involving [[Tusken Raiders]] attacking [[Luke Skywalker]] in his film ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' (1977). 

During the Well of Souls scene, when Indiana stares down the cobra, the snake's reflection is visible in the glass which was placed to prevent the cobra from actually harming any of the actors (the reflection was digitally removed for the 2003 DVD release). Famously when 6000 snakes were bought on set, Spielberg still felt there were not enough, so crew members cut up plastic tubes and placed them carefully between live snakes. During Elstree filming, Harrison Ford also had to outrun the boulder 10 times, and Alfred Molina had to endure 100 live tarantulas.<ref name="facts and trivia"/>. Whilst all the snakes were fine, one spider fell and died - as a result the movie does not have a 'No Animals Were Harmed in the Making of this Production' notification{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

There were three stunt doubles for Harrison Ford, the primary one being British born stunt man [[Vic Armstrong]], who reportedly resembled Ford to the degree that people off camera often mistook him for the real Ford. But Ford fought to do many of the fights and stunts himself, arguing there would not be much else for him to do if he was not in the thick of it.

The opening exteriors were filmed in Kauai, [[Hawaii]], and exteriors set in [[Washington D.C.]] were filmed outside of [[San Francisco]]'s City Hall. The [[University of the Pacific]], located in [[Stockton, California]], stands in for (the unnamed) Marshall College where Jones works, and his home exteriors were filmed in the city of [[San Rafael, California]].<ref name="world"/> Spielberg managed to shoot the film in only 73 days, wrapping under schedule, (on [[September 4]], [[1980]]). In contrast to his previous film, ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]''.<ref name="mcbride"/> The Washington D.C. exterior was a pick-up (added in after main filming), as the film was originally written to end without any resolution of Indy's relationship to Marion. The brief footage showing the activity on a D.C. street (with the Washington Monument prominently in the background) was actually "borrowed" from the 1975 disaster film ''[[The Hindenburg (film)|The Hindenburg]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Twenty-Five Reasons to Watch Raiders Again|publisher=Official website|date=[[2006-06-12]]|url=http://www.indianajones.com/raiders/bts/news/f20060612/indexp4.html|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref>
{{endspoilers}}

===Deleted scenes===
A famous scene from Kasdan's screenplay, which involved Indiana Jones stealing one half of the staff's head piece from an Asian museum, was cut before filming. Elements of it resurfaced in the prequel, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Raiders of the Lost Scene - Unearthed in the Lucasfilm Archives|publisher=Official website|date=[[2005-08-24]]|url=http://www.indianajones.com/raiders/bts/news/f20050824/index.html|accessdate=2007-03-12}}</ref>

Another famous scene showed a worker fainting after seeing Indiana and Marion emerge from the [[Well of Souls]],<ref>http://www.indianajones.com/raiders/bts/news/f20060612/index.html</ref> and he can be seen in the final cut. Other deleted scenes included a Nazi threatening to execute Sallah and a build up to a kiss between Indiana and Marion when they meet at her bar.

''Raiders of the Lost Ark'''s score is most notable for featuring the rousing and iconic composition "The Raiders March" that came to symbolize Indiana Jones. The tune was composed by [[John Williams]]. The score also featured three other prominent themes: the grand yet mysterious "Ark Theme", a theme associated with Marion, and the loud, pompous Nazi March. The score had received an Oscar nomination for best original score, but lost to [[Vangelis]]' electro-synth based score for ''[[Chariots of Fire]]''. John Williams composed the march in the two seperate segments. When he played them for Steven Spielberg he told John that he liked them both, which led to the combined theme people know today.<ref>{{cite video|people=[[John Williams]]|title=The Music of Indiana Jones|format=[[DVD]]|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]]|year=2003}}</ref>

== Reaction ==
When released on [[June 12]] the $20-million film was a huge success, easily the highest grossing film (earning $383 million worldwide) of 1981, and, at the time, one of the highest-grossing movies ever made. According to the 2005 edition of The ''[[World Almanac]]'' (from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' data), the first two ''[[Star Wars]]'' films are the only pictures released prior to 1981 that have out-earned ''Raiders''. ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' was nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]], including Best Picture, in 1982 and won four (Best Sound, Best Film Editing, Best Visual Effects, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration). It won numerous other awards including seven [[Saturn Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Hats off to Indy: The Many Awards of Indiana Jones|publisher=Official website|date=[[2006-02-24]]|url=http://www.indianajones.com/raiders/bts/news/news20040224.html|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref>

Following the box office success of ''Raiders'', two more feature films were produced: ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', which is a prequel, and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', which is a sequel. Another sequel, known only as ''[[Indiana Jones 4]]'', is also in pre-production. A TV series, entitled ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', also spun off from this film, and details the early years of the character leading up to this film. Numerous other books, comics and video games have also been produced.

In 1998, the [[American Film Institute]] placed the film at number 60 on its top 100 films of the first century of cinema. In 1999 the film was deemed "culturally significant" by the [[United States]] [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].

An amateur shot-for-shot remake was made by Chris Strompolos, Eric Zala and Jayson Lamb, then children in [[Biloxi]], [[Mississippi]]. It took the boys seven years to finish, from 1982-1989. After production of the film, called ''Raiders of the Lost Ark: The Adaptation'', wrapped in 1989, it was shelved and forgotten until 2003, where it was discovered by [[Eli Roth]]<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Harry Knowles]]|title=RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK shot-for-shot teenage remake review!!!|publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|date=[[2003-05-31]]|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=15348|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> and acclaimed by Spielberg himself<ref>{{cite web|title=Quotes on The Adaptation|publisher=The Indy Experience|url=http://www.theindyexperience.com/raiders_adaptation/raiders_adaptation_press.php|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> who congratulated the boys on their hard work and said he looked forward to seeing their names on the big screen.<ref>{{cite news|author=Sarah Hepola|title=Lost Ark Resurrected|publisher=[[Austin Chronicle]]|date=[[2003-05-30]]|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2003-05-30/screens_feature4.html|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> [[Scott Rudin]] and [[Paramount Pictures]] have purchased the trio's life rights and will be producing a film based on their adventures making their remake, known as the ''Untitled Daniel Clowes Project'' (2006).<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Harry Knowles]]|title=Sometimes, The Good Guys Win!!!

==Video games==
The only [[computer and video games|video game]] based exclusively on this movie is ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark (Atari 2600)|Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', released in 1982 by [[Atari]] for their [[Atari 2600]] console.

The first third of the video game ''[[Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures]]'', released in 1994 by JVC for [[Nintendo]]'s [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], is based entirely on the film. Several sequences from the film are reproduced (the boulder run and the showdown with the Cairo Swordsman among them); however, several odd anachronisms make their way into the game as well, such as Nazi soldiers and bats being present in the Well of Souls sequence, for example. The game was developed by [[LucasArts]] and [[Factor 5]].

In [[Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine]] a bonus level brings Indy back to 'Peru, South America' from this movie. He can explore the cave and he discovers another hidden idol.

==DVD release==
For its 1999 [[VHS]] re-issue, and the subsequent [[DVD]] release in 2003, the outer package has been retitled ''Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark''. However, the title in the film itself remains unchanged, even in the restored DVD print. The newer video boxes of the movie on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] are titled in order to correlate with the film's prequel and sequel.

==Cultural references==  
* In the opening scene, the rolling boulder booby trap is very similar to the climax of the 1943 [[Abbott and Costello]] film, ''[[Hit the Ice (film)|Hit The Ice]]''. In that film, [[Lou Costello]] and a bank robber that he had been fighting with roll down a snowy mountain and become enveloped in a large ball of snow. As it rolls down the hill it comes very close to running over [[Bud Abbott]] who is on skis in front of the ball of snow.
* In addition, the opening scene can also be compared to the 1954 [[Carl Barks]] [[Uncle Scrooge]] adventure "The Seven Cities of Cibola" (Uncle Scrooge #7). The movie plot is also similar (and probably inspired as well) to many Carl Barks ''Uncle Scrooge'' comic books, which were often center around journey for a famous (historical/legendary) treasure.
*The final scene of the crated ark in the government warehouse appears to be a tribute to one of the final shots in Orson Welles' ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941).
* In the [[Well of Souls]], an image of [[R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO]], from Lucas's earlier film ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'', is hidden among the other hieroglyphs.
*At one point in the harbor, the loudspeaker announces: "Ein, ein, drei, acht"--"One, one, three, eight" in [[German language|German]]. The number is a a reference to his film [[THX-1138]], and its mention is a running joke by Lucas; see [[1138 (number)]].
*[[Ralph McQuarrie]] drew the picture of the [[Ark of the Covenant]] in the Bible Indiana looks at during an early exposition scene.<ref>http://www.indianajones.com/raiders/bts/news/f20060612/indexp3.html</ref>
*In The game Diablo II, In the second Act the player needs to combine two pieces to create the Horadric Staff, after doing this he or she must find the real Tomb of Tal Rasha and insert the staff into the Orfice (hole in the floor) which opens a hole in the wall leading to the boss. This is vaguely similar to Raiders of Lost Ark, for which the player discover the location of the boss as opposed to the Ark.
*Additionally in Diablo II, if a player whom has selected the Druid character enters the bottom-most level of the Claw Viper Temple in Act II (to complete the quest Tainted Sun, accomplished by killing a number of giant snake-men and retrieving a particular item), the Druid character will utter Indy's phrase from the Well of Souls scene: "Snakes. Why did it have to be snakes. I hate snakes."
