The '''climate of India''' encompasses a wide range of weather conditions across a vast geographic scale and varied topography, making generalisations difficult. For example, based on the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen system]], [[India]] hosts six major climatic subtypes, ranging from arid desert in the west, alpine tundra and glaciers in the north, and humid tropical regions supporting rainforests in the southwest. In addition, starkly different [[microclimate]]s occur in each climate type; these can even border each other. The nation generally experiences three seasons: summer, which lasts from March to June; a [[monsoon]] (rainy) season, lasting from June to October; and winter, from November to March.

India's climate is strongly influenced by its unique [[geography of India|geography]] and [[geology of India|geology]], particularly the [[Himalayas]] in the north and the [[Thar Desert]] in the northwest. The Himalayas ensure that, by acting as a barrier to frigid [[katabatic wind]]s flowing down from [[Central Asia]], [[North India]] is kept warm or only mildly cooled during winter; in summer, it keeps India relatively hot. Thus, although the [[Tropic of Cancer]], which is the dividing line between the tropics and subtropics, passes almost through the middle of India, it is as a whole considered to be a tropical country. 

As in much of the tropics, monsoonal and other weather conditions in India are somewhat unstable; major droughts, floods, cyclones, and other natural disasters occur sporadically, but have killed or displaced millions. Its climatic stability is further threatened by ongoing and predicted [[climate change]]. Yet the diversity of climates in India, ranging from the formerly lush Thar Desert to [[Cherrapunji]], the world's wettest place, makes analysis of such issues complex.

== History ==

During the [[Lopingian|Late Permian]], the [[Indian subcontinent]], of which India composes the greater part, was once part of the vast [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]]. Despite its position within a high-latitude belt at 55&ndash;75°&nbsp;S (as opposed to its current position between 5 and 35°&nbsp;N), latidudes now occupied by such places as [[Greenland]] and  parts of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], it likely experienced a humid temperate climate with warm, frost-free weather, though with well-defined seasons.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chumakov NM, Zharkov MA |year=2003 |url=http://palaeoentomolog.ru/Lib/Chumakov3.pdf |title=Climate of the Late Permian and Early Triassic: General Inferences |journal=Stratigraphy and Geological Correlation |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=361-375 |accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref> Later, India joined the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]], a process beginning some 550&ndash;500&nbsp;[[mya (unit)|million years ago]] (mya). During the Late [[Paleozoic]], Gondwana extended from a point at or near the [[South Pole]] to near the equator, where the [[Indian craton]] (stable [[continental crust]]) was positioned, resulting in a mild climate favorable to hosting high-[[biomass]] [[ecosystems]]; this is underscored by India's vast [[coal]] reserves—much of it from the late Paleozoic sedimentary sequence—that compose 3% of the world's total. During the [[Mesozoic]], the world, including India, was considerably warmer than today. During the [[Carboniferous]], [[global cooling]] stoked extensive [[glaciation]], which spread northwards from [[South Africa]] towards India; this cool period lasted into the [[Permian]].

The [[Indian Plate]]'s subsequent [[plate tectonics|tectonic movement]] caused it to pass over a geologic [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]]—the [[Réunion hotspot]]—now occupied by the volcanic island of [[Réunion]]. This resulted in a massive [[flood basalt]] event that laid down the [[Deccan Traps]] some 60&ndash;68&nbsp;mya,<ref name="mantleplumes">[http://www.mantleplumes.org/Deccan.html The Deccan beyond the plume hypothesis]</ref><ref>[http://ksgeo.kj.yamagata-u.ac.jp/~iwata/personal/Deccan-e.htm Geochronological Study of the Deccan Volcanism]</ref> at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period. This may have contributed to the global [[Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event|Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) extinction event]], which caused India to experience significantly reduced [[insolation]]. Elevated atmospheric levels of sulphur gases formed [[aerosol]]s such as [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[sulfuric acid]], similar to those found in the [[atmosphere of Venus|atmosphere]] of [[Venus]]; these precipitated as [[acid rain]]. Elevated [[carbon dioxide]] emissions also contributed to the [[greenhouse effect]], causing [[global warming]] that lasted long after the atmospheric shroud of dust and aerosols had cleared. Further climatic changes 20 million years ago, long after India had crashed into the [[Laurasia]]n landmass, were severe enough to cause the extinction of many endemic Indian forms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Karanth KP |year=2006 |month=March |url=http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/mar252006/789.pdf |title=Out-of-India Gondwanan origin of some tropical Asian biota |journal=Current Science |volume=90 |issue=6 |pages=789-792}}</ref>

India is home to an extraordinary range of climatic regions, ranging from tropical in the south to temperate and alpine in the Himalayan north, where elevated regions receive sustained winter snowfall. Its climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, as India's northern and north-eastern states are partially situated in the mountains. The Himalayas, along with the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains in [[Pakistan]], prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in. This keeps the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar [[latitude]]s. Simultaneously, the Thar Desert plays a role in attracting moisture-laden southwest summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate, and these can be further subdivided into seven climatic subtypes according to the Köppen climate classification system.

=== Tropical wet ===

A tropical rainy climate covers regions experiencing persistent high temperatures, which normally do not fall below {{convert|18|°C|°F|0|lk=on}} even in the coolest months. India hosts two climatic subtypes that fall under this group. The most humid it the tropical monsoon rain forest climate that covers a strip of southwestern lowlands abutting the [[Malabar Coast]], the [[Western Ghats]], and southern [[Assam]]. Characterised by moderate to high year-round temperatures, even in the foothills, its rainfall is seasonal but heavy—typically above {{convert|2000|mm|in|0|lk=on}} per year. Most rainfall occurs between May and November; this is adequate for the maintenance of lush forests and other vegetation throughout the remainder of the year. December to March are the driest months, when days with precipitation are rare. The heavy monsoon rains are responsible for the extremely biodiverse tropical wet forests of these regions.

However, a tropical wet and dry climate subtype defines most of India’s land falling into this group. Significantly drier than tropical wet zones, it prevails over most of inland peninsular India except for a semi-arid rain shadow east of the Western Ghats. Winter and early summer are long, dry periods with temperature averaging above {{convert|18|°C|°F|0}}. Summer is exceptionally hot; temperatures in low-lying areas may exceed {{convert|45|°C|°F|0}} during May. The rainy season lasts from June to September; annual rainfall averages between 750&ndash;1500&nbsp;millimeters (30&ndash;59&nbsp;in). Only Tamil Nadu receives substantial rainfall during the winter months between October and December.

=== Tropical dry ===

[[Image:deccan.jpg|thumb|right|Much of the central [[Deccan Plateau]] (depicted) is semi-arid and drought-prone.]]

A tropical arid and semi-arid climate dominates regions where the rate of water's [[evapotranspiration]] is higher than the rate of moisture received through precipitation; it is subdivided into three climate types. The first, a tropical semi-arid steppe climate, predominates over a long stretch of land situated to the south of Tropic of Cancer and east of the Western Ghats and the [[Cardamom Hills]]. The region, which includes [[Karnataka]], inland Tamil Nadu, western [[Andhra Pradesh]], and central [[Maharashtra]], gets between 400&ndash;750&nbsp;millimeters (16&ndash;30&nbsp;in) annually. It is drought-prone, as it tends to have less reliable rainfall due to occasional late arrival of the southwest monsoon. North of the [[Krishna River]], the summer monsoon is responsible for most rainfall; to the south, significant rainfall also occurs in October and November. In December, the coldest month, temperatures still average around 20&ndash;24°C (68&ndash;75&nbsp;°F). The months between March to May are hot and dry; mean monthly temperatures hover around {{convert|320|mm|in|0}}. Hence, without artificial irrigation, this region is not suitable for permanent agriculture.

[[Image:Jaisalmer-3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jaisalmer]], in western Rajasthan, is situated in the heart of the Thar Desert. The region is arid and dusty.]]

Most of western [[Rajasthan]] falls under a tropical and sub-tropical climate type characterised by scanty rainfall. [[Cloudburst]]s are responsible for nearly the entire total of annual precipitation in this region, which totals less than {{convert|300|mm|in|0}}. Such bursts happen when monsoon winds sweep into the region during July, August, and September. The rainfall is very erratic; regions experiencing rainfall one year may not see precipitation for the next couple of years or so. The summer months of May and June are exceptionally hot; mean monthly temperatures in the region hover around {{convert|35|°C|°F|0}}, with daily maximums occasionally topping {{convert|50|°C|°F|0}}. During winters, ambient temperatures in some areas can drop below the freezing point due to waves of cold air from Central Asia. There is a large diurnal range of about {{convert|14|°C|°F|0}} during summer; this widens by several degrees during winter. This extreme climate accounts for it being one of the most sparsely populated regions in India.

The region towards the east of the tropical desert running from [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[Haryana]] to [[Kathiawar]] experiences a tropical and sub-tropical [[steppe]] climate. This zone, which is a transitional climate separating tropical desert from humid sub-tropical lands, experiences temperatures which are less extreme than the desert climate. Average annual rainfall is 30&ndash;65&nbsp;cm, but is very unreliable; as in much of the rest of India, the summer monsoon season accounts for most precipitation. Daily maximum temperatures during summer can rise to around {{convert|40|°C|°F|0}}. The resulting natural vegetation typically comprises short, coarse grasses.

=== Subtropical humid ===

Most of Northeast India and much of North India are subject to a humid sub-tropical climate. Though they experience hot summers, temperatures during the coldest months may fall as low as {{convert|0|°C|°F|0}}. Due to ample monsoon rains, India has only one subtype of this climate, ''Cfa''. In most of this region, there is very little precipitation during the winter, owing to powerful anticyclonic and katabatic (downward-flowing) winds from Central Asia. Due to the region's proximity to the Himalayas, it experiences elevated prevailing wind speeds, again from the influence of Central Asian katabatic movements.

=== Montane ===

[[Image:Pangong lake by martinl.jpg|thumb|[[Pangong Tso|Pangong Lake]] in [[Ladakh]], an arid montane region lying deep within the Himalayas.]]

India's northernmost fringes are subject to a montane, or alpine, climate. In the Himalayas, temperatures falls by {{convert|0.6|°C|°F|1}} for every {{convert|100|m|ft|0|lk=on}} rise in altitude, giving rise to climates ranging from nearly tropical in the foothills to tundra above the snow line. Sharp temperature contrasts between sunny and shady slopes, high diurnal temperature variability, temperature inversions, and altitude-dependent variability in rainfall are also prevalent. The northern side of the western Himalayas, also known as the trans-Himalayan belt, is a region of arid, frigid, and generally wind-blown wastes. Most precipitation comes as snowfall during the late winter and spring months.

Areas to the south of the Himalayas are protected from cold winter winds coming in from interior of Asia. The leeward side of the mountains receives less rain while the well-exposed slopes get heavy rainfall. Areas situated at altitudes of 1,070&ndash;2,290&nbsp;m receive the heaviest rainfall, which decreases rapidly as one climbs above {{convert|2290|m|ft|0}}. The Himalayas experience the heaviest snowfall from December to February at altitudes above {{convert|1500|m|ft|0}}.

== Seasons ==

Most of India experiences three distinct seasons:
* '''Summer''', typically lasting from March to June (April to July in northwestern India). The hottest month for western and southern regions is April; for northern regions, May is the hottest month. Temperatures average around 32&ndash;40&nbsp;°C (90&ndash;104&nbsp;°F) in most of the interior.
* '''Monsoon''' or '''rainy''' season, lasting from June to October. South India typically receives more precipitation. Monsoonal rains begin to recede from North India at the beginning of October. In northwestern India, October and November are usually cloudless.
* '''Winter''', from November to March. The year's coldest months are December and January, when temperatures average around 10&ndash;15&nbsp;°C (50&ndash;59&nbsp;°F) in the northwest; temperatures rise as one proceeds towards the equator, peaking around 20&ndash;25&nbsp;°C (68&ndash;77&nbsp;°F) in mainland India's southeast.

The Himalayan states, being more temperate, experience an additional two seasons: autumn and spring. Traditionally, Indians note six seasons, each about two months long. These are the spring (''{{lang-sa|vasant}}''), summer (''greeshm''), monsoons (''varsha''), early autumn (''sharad''), late autumn (''hemant''), and winter (''shishir''). These are based on the astronomical division of the twelve months into six parts. The ancient [[Hindu calendar]] also reflects these seasons in its arrangement of months.

=== Winter ===

[[Image:Gurudongmar north sikkim himalayas india.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gurudogmar Lake]] in winter, elevation {{convert|5148|m|ft|0}}, in [[North Sikkim]].]]
<!--[[Image:Rathong from Zemathang2.jpg|thumb|right|The Indian Himalayas regularly experience heavy snowfall and other inclement conditions. Pictured is Goecha Peak in [[West Sikkim]].]]-->
<!--[[Image:Vaishno.jpg|thumb|right|Inclement conditions abound in Indian Himalayas: pictured is the [[Vaishno Devi]] temple in [[Jammu]], shrouded in snow.]]-->

Once the monsoons subside, average temperatures gradually fall across India after September. As the Sun's vertical rays move south of the equator, the most of the country experiences moderately cool weather; temperatures decrease by about 0.6&nbsp;°C (1.1&nbsp;°F) for every degree of latitude that one moves north. December and January are typically the coldest months, with mean temperatures of 10&ndash;15&nbsp;°C (50&ndash;59&nbsp;°F) in the northwest and the Himalayan region. The mean temperatures increase towards east and south, where it is reaches 20&ndash;25&nbsp;°C (68&ndash;77&nbsp;°F). 

October and November are virtually cloudless in northwestern India, resulting wide diurnal temperature swings; as in much of the Deccan Plateau, temperatures range between 16 to 20&nbsp;°C. However, starting in March and lasting until May, bursts of heavy rain and snowfall result from "western disturbances", which are extra-tropical [[low pressure area|low-pressure system]]s originating in the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]].<ref name="Hatwar_2005">{{cite journal |author=Hatwar HR, Yadav BP, Rama Rao YV |title=Prediction of western disturbances and associated weather over Western Himalayas |journal=Current Science |volume=88 |issue=6 |pages=913-920 |year=2005 |month=March |url=http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/mar252005/913.pdf |accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref> These are carried west-to-east by the subtropical [[westerlies]], the [[prevailing winds]] blowing at North India's range of latitude.<ref name="Das_2002">{{cite journal |author=Das MR, Mukhopadhyay RK, Dandekar MM, Kshirsagar SR |title=Pre-monsoon western disturbances in relation to monsoon rainfall, its advancement over NW India and their trends |journal=Current Science |volume=82 |issue=11 |pages=1320-1321 |year=2002 |month=June |url=http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jun102002/1320.pdf| accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref> As they travel, their passage is hindered by the Himalayas; unable to proceed further, they release precipitation over northwestern India instead. In addition to rain in much of the north, the three Himalayan states (Jammu and Kashmir in the extreme north, [[Himachal Pradesh]], and [[Uttarakhand]]) experience heavy snowfall; in Jammu and Kashmir, blizzards occur regularly, disrupting travel and other activities.

[[Image:Wandoor beach andaman islands india.jpg|thumb|right|Even in winter, temperatures in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (pictured) and [[Lakshadweep]] remain remarkably equable; monthly averages do not vary more by than 2&nbsp;°C (4&nbsp;°F).]]

The rest of India, including the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]], does not receive snow. However, in the plains, temperatures occasionally fall below freezing, though never for more than a couple of days during December or January. Highs in Delhi range between {{convert|16|°C|°F|0}} to {{convert|21|°C|°F|0}}. Nighttime temperatures average between 2&ndash;8&nbsp;°C. Further north, lows in the plains of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] can fall below freezing, dropping to around {{convert|-6|°C|°F|0}} in [[Amritsar]]. Frost sometimes occurs, but the hallmark of the season is the notorious [[fog]], which frequently disrupts daily life; fog grows thick enough to substantially hinder visibility and disrupt air travel an average of 15&ndash;20&nbsp;days annually.<ref name="AI_2003">{{cite web |url=http://www.airindia.com/article.asp?articleid=235 |title=Air India reschedules Delhi-London/New York and Frankfurt flights due to fog |accessdate=2007-03-18 |work=Air India |date=[[17 December]] [[2003]]}}</ref> In contrast, eastern India's climate is much milder, experiencing moderately warm days and cool nights. Highs range from {{convert|23|°C|°F|0}} in [[Patna]] to {{convert|26|°C|°F|0}} in [[Kolkata]] (Calcutta); lows average from {{convert|8|°C|°F|0}} in Patna to {{convert|14|°C|°F|0}} in  Kolkata. Frigid winds from the Himalayas can depress temperatures near the [[Brahmaputra River]]. The two Himalayan states in the east, [[Sikkim]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]], receive substantial snowfall. The extreme north of [[West Bengal]], centered around [[Darjeeling]], also experiences snowfall, but only rarely. 

In [[South India]], particularly the Maharashtrian hinterland, [[Madhya Pradesh]], parts of Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, somewhat cooler weather prevails. Minimum temperatures in western Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and [[Chhattisgarh]] hover around {{convert|10|°C|°F|0}}; in the southern Deccan Plateau, they reach {{convert|16|°C|°F|0}}. Coastal areas, especially those near the [[Coromandel Coast]], and low-elevation interior tracts are warm, with daily high temperatures of {{convert|30|°C|°F|0}} and lows of around {{convert|21|°C|°F|0}}. The Western Ghats, including the [[Nilgiris (mountains)|Nilgiri Range]], are exceptional; there, lows can fall below freezing. This compares with a range of 12&ndash;14&nbsp;°C on the Malabar Coast, where the Indian Ocean exerts a strong moderating influence on weather.

=== Summer ===

[[Image:Khajjiar himachal pradesh india summer.jpg|thumb|right|A summer view of [[Khajjiar]], a hill station in [[Himachal Pradesh]].]]

Summer in northwestern India lasts from April to July, and in the rest of the country from March to June. The temperatures in the north rise as the vertical rays of the Sun reach the Tropic of Cancer. The hottest month for the western and southern regions of the country is April; for most of North India, it is May. Temperatures of {{convert|49|°C|°F|0}} and higher have been recorded in parts of India during this season. In cooler regions, hailstones may fall. Near the coast the temperature hovers around {{convert|36|°C|°F|0}}, and the proximity of the sea increases the level of humidity. In southern India, the temperatures are higher on the east coast by a few degrees compared to the west coast. 

By May, most of the Indian interior experiences mean temperatures over {{convert|32|°C|°F|0}}, while maximum temperatures often exceed {{convert|40|°C|°F|0}}. In the hot months of April and May, western disturbances, with their cooling influence, may still arrive, but rapidly diminish in frequency as summer progresses.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pisharoty PR, Desai BN |title=Western disturbances and Indian weather |journal=Indian Journal of Meteorological Geophysics |year=1956 |volume=7 |pages=333–338}}</ref> Notably, a higher frequency of such disturbances in April correlates with a delayed monsoon onset (thus extending summer) in northwest India. In eastern India, monsoon onset dates have been steadily advancing over the past several decades, resulting in shorter summers there.<ref name="Das_2002"/>

Altitude affects the temperature to a large extent, with the higher parts of the [[Deccan Plateau]] and hills being relatively cooler. [[Hill station]]s, such as [[Ootacamund]] ("Ooty") in the Western Ghats and [[Kalimpong]] in the Himalayas, with average maximum temperatures of around {{convert|25|°C|°F|0}}, offer some respite from the heat. At lower elevations, in parts of northern and western India, a strong, hot, and dry wind known as the [[Loo (wind)|Loo]] blows in from the west during the daytime; with very high temperatures, in some cases up to around {{convert|45|°C|°F|0}}, it can cause deadly cases of sunstroke. Tornadoes may also occur, concentrated in a corridor stretching from northeastern India towards Pakistan. They are rare, however; only several dozen have been reported since 1835.<ref name="Peterson_1981">{{cite journal |author=Peterson RE, Mehta KC |title=Climatology of tornadoes of India and Bangladesh |journal=Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=345-356 |year=1981 |month=December}}</ref>

The southwest summer monsoon, a four-month period when massive convective thunderstorms dominate India's weather, is Earth's most significant wet season.<ref name="Collier_Webb_2002_91">{{harvnb|Collier|Webb|2002|p=91}}.</ref> It results from the southeast [[trade wind]]s originating from a high-pressure mass centered over the southern Indian Ocean; attracted by a low-pressure region centered over South Asia, it gives rise to surface winds that ferry humid air into India from the southwest.<ref name="Caviedes_2001_118">{{harvnb|Caviedes|2001|p=118}}.</ref> These inflows ultimately result from a northward shift of the local jet stream, which itself results from rising summer temperatures over [[Tibet]] and the Indian subcontinent.

The main factor behind this shift is the high summer temperature difference between Central Asia and the Indian Ocean.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Burns SJ, Fleitmann D, Matter A, Kramers J, Al-Subbary AA |title=Indian Ocean Climate and an Absolute Chronology over Dansgaard/Oeschger Events 9 to 13 |journal=Science |volume=301 |issue=5638 |pages=635-638 |year=2003 |issn=0036-8075}}</ref> This is accompanied by a seasonal excursion of the normally equatorial [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ), a low-pressure belt of highly unstable weather, northward towards India.<ref name="Burroughs_1999_138-139">{{harvnb|Burroughs|1999|pp=138-139}}.</ref> This system intensified to its present strength as a result of the [[Tibetan Plateau]]'s [[orogeny|uplift]], which accompanied the [[Eocene]]–[[Oligocene]] transition event, a major episode of global cooling and aridification which occurred 34&ndash;49&nbsp;mya.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dupont-Nivet G, Krijgsman W, Langereis CG, Abels HA, Dai S, Fang X |title=Tibetan plateau aridification linked to global cooling at the Eocene–Oligocene transition |journal=Nature |volume=445 |issue=7128 |pages=635-638 |year=2007 |issn=0028-0836}}</ref>

There are two branches to the southwest monsoon: the [[Bay of Bengal]] branch; and the [[Arabian Sea]] branch, which extends to a low-pressure area over the Thar Desert. The Arabian Sea branch is roughly three times stronger than the Bay of Bengal branch. Taken as a whole, the monsoon usually breaks over Indian territory by around [[25 May]], hitting the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] in the Bay of Bengal. It strikes the Indian mainland beginning around [[1 June]],<ref name="IMD_swsm_onset">{{cite web |url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/climate/monsoon-onset.htm |title=Southwest Monsoon: Normal Dates of Onset}}</ref> supplies over 80% of India's annual rainfall.<ref name="Bagla">{{cite journal |author=Bagla P |year=2006 |month=August |title=Controversial rivers project aims to turn India's fierce monsoon into a friend |journal=Science |volume=313 |issue=5790 |pages=1036-1037 |issn=0036-8075}}</ref> first striking near the [[Malabar Coast]] of Kerala. By [[9 June]], it reaches [[Mumbai]]; it appears over [[Delhi]] by [[29 June]]. The Bay of Bengal branch, which initially closely hugs the Coromandal Coast, abruptly curves to the northwest after reaching Orissa; the Arabian Sea branch generally moves northeast towards the Himalayas. By the first week of July, the entire country experiences rain. During the season, South India usually receives more rainfall than North India. However, [[North-East India|Northeast India]] receives the most precipitation. The monsoon clouds begin to retreat from North India by the last week of August. It withdraws from Mumbai by [[5 October]]; after the air over India cools further during September, the monsoon gradually departs India altogether, usually by the end of November.<ref name="Burroughs_1999_138-139"/>

From October to December, a different monsoon cycle, the northeast (or "retreating") monsoon, brings dry, cool, and dense air from Central Asia. Winds spill across the Himalayas and flow to the southwest across India, resulting in clear, sunny skies.<ref name="Caviedes_2001_119">{{harvnb|Caviedes|2001|p=119}}.</ref> Though the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD) and other sources refers to this period as a fourth ("post-monsoon") season,<ref name="IMD_four_seasons">{{cite web |url=http://www.imd.ernet.in/section/nhac/dynamic/TABLE-1.htm |title=Rainfall during pre-monsoon season |work=India Meteorological Department |accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref><ref name="LOC_four_seasons">{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/intoc.html |title=A Country Study: India |work=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]] |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] ([[Federal Research Division]]) |accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Parthasarathy B, Munot AA, Kothawale DR |title=All-India monthly and seasonal rainfall series: 1871–1993 |journal=Theoretical and Applied Climatology |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=217-224 |year=1994 |month=December |issn=0177-798X}}</ref> other sources designate only three seasons.<ref>{{cite journal |author=O'Hare G |title=The Indian Monsoon, Part Two: The Rains |journal=Geography |volume=82 |issue=4 |pages=335 |year=1997}}</ref> Depending on location, this period lasts from October and November, after the southwest monsoon has peaked. Less and less precipitation falls, and vegetation begins to dry out. In most parts of India, this period marks the transition from wet to dry seasonal conditions.

== Natural disasters ==

[[Image:India climatic disaster risk map en.svg|thumb|right|Disaster-prone regions in India.]]

India is prone to several types of climate-related natural disasters that are responsible for massive losses of life and property. These include droughts; flash floods, and widespread and destructive flooding from monsoon rains; severe cyclones; landslides and avalanches brought on by torrential rains; and snowstorms. Other events include frequent summer dust storms, which usually track from north to south and cause extensive property damage in northern India.<ref name="Balfour_1976_995">{{harvnb|Balfour|1976|p=995}}.</ref> These storms bring with them large amounts of dust from arid regions. Hail is also common in parts of India, and cause severe damage to standing crops like rice and wheat.

=== Floods and landslides ===

Landslides are common in the Lower Himalaya, owing to [[lability|labile]] rock formations due to the young age of the hills. Deforestation, resulting from both rising population pressure and tourism-related and other development, has been been implicated as a major factor in exacerbating the extent of landslides, since tree cover impedes the flow of monsoon rains down hillsides.<ref name="Allaby_1998_26">{{harvnb|Allaby|1998|p=26}}.</ref> Parts of the Western Ghats also suffer from low-intensity landslides. Avalanches occur in Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and Sikkim.

[[Image:Brahmaputra-verlaufsgebiet.jpg|thumb|left|The swollen Brahmaputra River in northeastern India.]]

However, floods are the most common natural disaster in India. When the monsoon season arrives, the heavy rainfall that follows the dry winter months may cause rivers to distend their banks, often flooding the surrounding areas. One example is the [[Brahmaputra River]] is prone to perennial flooding during the monsoon season. But while the seasonal floods are often responsible for killing thousands and displacing millions, they also provide rice paddy farmers with a largely dependable source of natural irrigation. Nevertheless, excess, erratic, or untimely monsoon rainfall may still wash away or otherwise ruin crops.<ref name="Allaby_1998_42">{{harvnb|Allaby|1998|p=42}}.</ref><ref name="Allaby_1998_15">{{harvnb|Allaby|1998|p=15}}.</ref> With the exception of a few states, almost all of India is prone to flooding. Extreme precipitation events, such as flash floods and torrential rains, have been increasingly common in central India over the past several decades, coinciding with rising temperatures; however, mean annual precipitation totals have remained steady due to the declining frequency of weather systems that generate more moderate amounts of rain.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Goswami BN, Venugopal V, Sengupta D, Madhusoodanan MS, Xavier PK |title=Increasing trend of extreme rain events over India in a warming environment |journal=Science |volume=314 |issue=5804 |pages=1442-1445 |year=2006 |issn=0036-8075}}</ref>

=== Cyclones ===

[[Image:India wind zone map en.svg|thumb|right|Map showing winds zones, shaded by distribution of average speeds of prevailing winds.]]

[[Tropical cyclone]]s, severe storms spun off from the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]], affect thousands of Indians living in coastal regions annually. [[Tropical cyclogenesis]] is particularly common in the northern reaches of the [[Indian Ocean]] in and around the Bay of Bengal. Cyclones bring with them heavy rains, [[storm surge]]s, and winds that often cut affected areas off from relief and supplies. The cyclone season in the North Indian Ocean Basin runs from April to December, with peak activity falling between May and November.<ref name = "AOML_FAQ_G1">{{cite web |author=[[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]], Hurricane Research Division |title=Frequently Asked Questions: When is hurricane season? |publisher=[[NOAA]] | accessdate=2006-07-25 |url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G1.html}}</ref> Each year, an average of eight storms with sustained wind speeds greater than {{convert|63|km:h|mi:h|0|lk=on}} form; of these, around two strengthen into true tropical cyclones, which have sustained gusts greater than {{convert|117|km:h|mi:h|0}}. On average, a major ([[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3]] or higher) cyclone develops every other year.<ref name = "AOML FAQ G1"/><ref name = "AOML FAQ E10">{{cite web | author = [[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]], Hurricane Research Division | title = Frequently Asked Questions: What are the average, most, and least tropical cyclones occurring in each basin? | publisher = [[NOAA]] | accessdate = 2006-07-25 | url = http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/E10.html}}</ref>

[[Image:Cyclone 05B 1999 India Bay of Bengal satellite image NOAA cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[NOAA]] satellite imagery of Cyclone 05B in the [[Bay of Bengal]].]]

During summer, the [[Bay of Bengal]] is subject to intense heating, giving rise to humid and unstable air masses that birth cyclones. Many powerful cyclones, including the [[1737 Calcutta Cyclone|1737 Calcutta cyclone]], the [[1970 Bhola cyclone]], and the [[1991 Bangladesh cyclone]], have led to widespread devastation along parts of the eastern coast of India and neighboring [[Bangladesh]]. Many deaths and widespread destruction of property are reported every year in exposed coastal states like Andhra Pradesh, [[Orissa]], Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal. On the more placid west coast and Arabian Sea, cyclones are rare, mainly affecting [[Gujarat]] and, to an even lesser extent, [[Kerala]].

One notable example is [[Cyclone 05B (1999)|Cyclone 05B]], a supercyclone that struck Orissa on [[29 October]] [[1999]]; in terms of damage and loss of life, it was the worst in more than a quarter century. With peak winds of {{convert|160|mi:h|km:h|0}}, it was the equivalent of a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5 hurricane]].<ref name="npmoc"/> Around 1.67 million people were left homeless;<ref name="bapscare">{{cite web |url=http://baps-care.org/services/disaster/1990/1999supercyclone.htm |title=1999 Supercyclone of Orissa |year=2005 |work=BAPS Care International}}</ref> another 19.5 million people were affected by the cyclone to some degree.<ref name="bapscare"/> A total of 9,803 people officially died from the storm,<ref name="npmoc">{{cite web |url=https://metocph.nmci.navy.mil/jtwc/atcr/1999atcr/pdf/05b.pdf |title=Tropical Cyclone 05B |work=Naval Maritime Forecast Center/Joint Typhoon Warning Center}}</ref> though unofficial estimates place the death toll at over 10,000.<ref name="bapscare"/>

=== Droughts ===

[[Image:Niranjana dry river bed bihar india.jpg|thumb|right|The dry bed of the Niranjana River, [[Bihar]].]]

Indian agriculture is heavily dependent on the monsoon as a source of water. In some parts of India, the failure of the monsoons result in water shortages, resulting in below-average crop yields. This is particularly true of major drought-prone regions such as southern and eastern Maharashtra, northern Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. In the past, such monsoon failures have periodically led to [[famine in India|major Indian famine]]s. Notable examples include the [[Bengal famine of 1770]], in which up to one third of the population in affected areas died; the 1876&ndash;1877 famine, in which over five million people died; the 1899 famine, in which over 4.5 million died; and the [[Bengal famine of 1943]], in which over five million died from starvation and famine-related illnesses.<ref name="Nash_2002_22-23">{{harvnb|Nash|2002|pp=22-23}}.</ref><ref name="Collier_2002_67">{{harvnb|Collier|Webb|2002|p=67}}.</ref>

All such episodes of severe drought correlate with [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) events.<ref name="Kumar_2006">{{cite journal |author=Kumar KK, Rajagopatan B, Hoerling M, Bates G, Cane M |title=Unraveling the Mystery of Indian Monsoon Failure During El Niño |journal=Science |volume=314 |issue=5796 |pages=115-119 |year=2006 |issn=0036-8075}}</ref><ref name="Caviedes_2001_121">{{harvnb|Caviedes|2001|p=121}}</ref> El Niño-related droughts have also been implicated in periodic declines in Indian agricultural output.<ref name="Caviedes_2001_259">{{harvnb|Caviedes|2001|p=259}}.</ref> Nevertheless, ENSO events that have coincided with abnormally high sea surfaces temperatures in the Indian Ocean—in one instance during 1997 and 1998 by up to 3&nbsp;°C (5&nbsp;°F)—have resulted in increased oceanic evaporation, resulting in unusually wet weather across India; such anomalies have occurred during a sustained warm spell that began in the 1990s.<ref name="Nash_2002_258-259">{{harvnb|Nash|2002|pp=258-259}}.</ref> A contrasting phenomenon is that, instead of the usual high pressure air mass over the southern Indian Ocean, an ENSO-related oceanic low pressure convergence center forms; it then continually pulls dry air from Central Asia, desiccating India during what should have been monsoon season. This reversed air flow thus results in India's sporadic droughts.<ref name="Caviedes_2001_117">{{harvnb|Caviedes|2001|p=117}}.</ref> The degree of such monsoon failure is determined by the extent that an ENSO event raises [[sea surface temperature]]s in the central [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref name="Kumar_2006"/>

The highest temperature recorded in India was {{convert|50.6|°C|°F|0}} in [[Alwar]], Rajasthan in 1955. This mark was also reached at [[Pachpadra]], also in Rajasthan. The lowest reported temperature was &minus;45&nbsp;°C (&minus;49°F) in [[Dras]], Ladakh, in eastern Jammu and Kashmir; however, the reading was taken with non-standard equipment. More reliable is the next lowest temperature, &minus;30.6&nbsp;°C (&minus;23&nbsp;°F), reported in [[Leh]], which is also in Ladakh.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mherrera.org/temp.htm |author=Herrera, Maximiliano |title=Extreme temperatures around the world |year=2005 |accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref> Recently, claims have been made of temperatures touching {{convert|55|°C|°F|0}} in Orissa;<ref>{{cite news |title=High water, heat wave, hope floats |first=Chandrika |last=Mago |date=[[20 June]] [[2005]] |work=Times News Network |publisher=Times of India (Mumbai) |format=print |page=14}}</ref> these have been met with some skepticism by the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD), which has questioned the methods used in recording such data.

In terms of snowfall, regions of Jammur and Kashmir, such as the [[Pir Panjal Range]] and Baramula district in the state's southeast, experience exceptionally heavy snowfall. For example, Kashmir's highest recorded monthly snowfall occurred in 1967, when {{convert|8.4|m|in|0}} fell in [[Gulmarg]] during February. However, the IMD has recorded snow drifts up to {{convert|12|m|ft|0}} in several Kashmiri districts. In another freak snowfall occurring in February of 2005, more than 200 people died as a result of a western disturbance, which, within a four-day span, delivered up to {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} of snowfall to various parts of the state.<ref>{{cite web |title=Snow fall and avalanches in Jammu and Kashmir |work=National Disaster Management Division (Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India) |date=[[28 February]] [[2005]] |url=http://mha.nic.in/press-release/pr240205.pdf |accessdate=2007-03-24}}</ref>

== Climate change ==

[[Image:LakshadweepIsland.jpg|thumb|right|Lakshadweep, comprising tiny low-lying islands, are at risk of being inundated by sea level rises associated with global warming.]]

Several [[effects of global warming|aspects of climate change]], including steady [[sea level rise]], increased cyclonic activity, and changes in ambient temperature and precipitation patterns, have impacted or are projected to impact India. For example, ongoing sea level rises have submerged several low-lying islands in the [[Sundarbans]], displacing thousands of people.<ref name="BBC_Harrabin_2007">{{cite web |work=BBC News |title=How climate change hits India's poor |last=Harrabin |first=Roger |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6319921.stm |date=[[1 February]] [[2007]] |=accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> Furthermore, as temperatures steadily rise on the Tibetan Plateau and [[retreat of glaciers since 1850|Himalayan glaciers retreat]], the long-term flow of the Brahmaputra River, upon which hundreds of thousands of farmers depend, could be jeopardised.

The [[Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research]] has reported that, if the predictions relating to global warming made by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] come to fruition, climate-related factors could cause India's GDP to decline by up to 9%; contributing to this would be shifting growing seasons for major crops such as rice, production of which could fall by 40%.
