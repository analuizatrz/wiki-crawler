The '''Brabham BT19''' is a [[Formula One]] racing car designed by [[Ron Tauranac]] for the British [[Brabham]] team<!--I assume readers will know when and where this team existed? (Awadewit)--><!--Quite probably not, but its championship year is mentioned just afterwards, and I can't see a neat way to put 1961 - 1992 into the text! 4u1e--> and used by Australian driver [[Jack Brabham]] in 1966 to win his third [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|world championship]]. The BT19, which Brabham referred to as his ''Old Nail'', was the first car bearing its driver's name to win a world championship race.<!--is there only one F1 world championship? does it have a page you could link to? (Awadewit)-->

It is a [[Wiktionary:one-off|one-off]], designed in 1965 for a 1.5&nbsp;litre (92&nbsp;[[cubic inch]]) [[Coventry Climax]] engine, but never raced in this form, because for the [[1966 Formula One season]] the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) doubled the limit on engine size to 3&nbsp;litres (183&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in). Australian company [[Repco]] developed a new [[V8]] engine for Brabham's use in 1966, but a disagreement between Brabham and Tauranac over the latter's role in the racing team left no time to develop a new car to handle it. Instead, the existing BT19 chassis was modified for the job.

==Concept==
[[Image:BrabhamJack1966B.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Jack Brabham]] was 40 when he won the F1 drivers' title driving BT19.]]
The BT19 was created by Australian designer [[Ron Tauranac]] for the Brabham Racing Organisation (BRO) to use in the [[1965 Formula One season|1965 season]] of the [[Formula One]] motor racing world championship. Formula One is the highest form of [[Open wheel car|single-seater]] racing defined by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA), motor sport's world governing body. Like the contemporary [[Lotus 39]], the BT19 was built to use [[Coventry Climax|Coventry Climax's]] FWMW [[flat-16]] engine, but was never raced in that form.<ref name ="GP45-65">Lawrence (1998) p.103</ref> The potentially more powerful flat-16 unit's development was abandoned before the end of the year: 1965 was the last season run under regulations limiting engine capacity to 1.5&nbsp;litres (92&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in) and Climax's existing FWMV [[V8]] engines proved good enough to power [[Jim Clark]]'s [[Lotus 33]] to seven wins and the drivers' championship. For the following season the engine capacity limit in Formula One doubled to 3&nbsp;litres (183&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in),<ref>Nye (1986) p.20</ref> meaning that a completely new design was needed.<ref name ="GP45-65" /> Climax chose not to develop such a unit, leaving many teams without a viable engine for 1966. [[Jack Brabham]], owner of and lead driver for BRO, solved the problem by persuading Australian company [[Repco]] to develop a new 3&nbsp;litre engine for him;<ref>Henry (1985) p.53</ref> the first example<!--Actually the first production example, not a prototype; That's how little preparation they had. 4u1e--> was delivered to the team's headquarters in the [[United Kingdom]] in late 1965.<ref>Pinder (1995) p.43</ref>

[[Brabham]] cars were designed and built by Motor Racing Developments Ltd. (MRD), a company jointly owned by Jack Brabham and Tauranac, which built cars for customers in several racing series. BRO, a separate company, bought its cars from MRD but Tauranac had little connection with the race team between 1962 and 1965.<ref>Lawrence (1999) p.31</ref> At the end of the 1965 season, Tauranac was losing interest in this arrangement, reasoning that "it was just a matter of a lot of effort for no real interest because I didn't get to go racing very much" and "I might as well get on with my main line business, which was selling production cars."<ref name = "Henry1" /> Although Jack Brabham investigated using [[chassis]] from other manufacturers, the two men eventually agreed that Tauranac would have a greater interest in the Formula One team, which MRD eventually took over completely from BRO.<ref name = "Henry1">Henry (1985) p.55</ref> This agreement was not reached until November 1965, however, which left no time for MRD to design a car for their new Australian-built engine. Chassis number F1-1-65, the unused BT19, was pressed into service instead.<ref name = "Nye1" />

==Chassis and suspension==
Tauranac built the car around a [[mild steel]] [[spaceframe]] chassis similar to those used in his previous Brabham designs.<ref name="material">Pinder (1995) p.104</ref> The use of a spaceframe was considered a conservative design decision: by 1966, most of Brabham's competitors were using the theoretically lighter and stiffer [[monocoque]] introduced to Formula One by Lotus during the [[1962 Formula One season]]. Tauranac believed that contemporary monocoques were not usefully stiffer than a well-designed spaceframe and were harder to repair and maintain.<ref name="Spaceframe">Lawrence (1999) pp.44-45</ref> The latter was a particular concern for Brabham, which was the largest manufacturer in the world of customer single-seater racing cars at the time. Their reputation was in part built on BRO, effectively the official 'works' team, using the same technology as the customers, for whom ease of repair was a significant consideration. One novel feature was the use of oval-section, rather than round, tubing around the cockpit, where the spaceframe cannot be triangulated fully, to strengthen it under beam loads.<ref name="Nye1">Nye (1986) p. 45</ref> The car weighed around 1250&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|pounds]] (567&nbsp;[[kg]]), around 150&nbsp;lb (68&nbsp;kg) over the minimum weight limit for the formula, although it was still one of the lightest cars in the 1966 field. The race starting weight of a 1966 Brabham-Repco with driver and fuel was estimated to be around 1415&nbsp;lb (642&nbsp;kg), about 280&nbsp;lb (127&nbsp;kg) less than the more powerful rival [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]]-[[Maserati]]s.<ref name="Weights">Unique p.45 ''Jack Brabham - World Champion'' Units of weight and volume are Imperial measures, as used in the original references. The exception is engine capacity, which was defined at the time in [[International System of Units|SI]] units.</ref>

The bodywork is [[glass-reinforced plastic]], finished in Brabham's normal racing colours of green with gold trimming around the nose.<ref name="material" /> Although the science of [[aerodynamics]] would not greatly affect Formula One racing until the [[1968 Formula One season]], Tauranac had been making use of the [[Motor Industry Research Association]] [[wind tunnel]] since 1963 to refine the shape of his cars.<ref>Lawrence (1999) p.43</ref> Jack Brabham has attributed the car's "swept-down nose and upswept rear lip to the engine cowl" to Tauranac's "attention to aerodynamic detail".<ref name="BrabNye1" />

Against the trend set by the [[Lotus 21]] in 1961,<ref>Lawrence (1998) p.190</ref> the [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] is outboard all round, with the bulky springs and dampers mounted in the space between the wheels and the bodywork, where they interfere with the airflow. Tauranac persisted with this apparently conservative approach based on wind tunnel tests he had carried out in the early 1960s. He judged the extra time needed to set up a more complicated inboard design at the racetrack to outweigh the 2% improvement in aerodynamic [[drag (physics)|drag]] such a design achieved.<ref name="Spaceframe" /> At the front the suspension consists of unequal length, non-parallel [[double wishbone suspension|double wishbones]]. The front uprights were modified from the [[Alford & Alder]] units used on the British [[Triumph Herald]] [[sedan|saloon]]. The rear suspension is formed by a single top link, a reversed lower wishbone and two [[radius rod]]s locating cast magnesium alloy uprights. Wheels were initially of 13&nbsp;[[inch]]es (330&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]]) diameter, but soon upgraded to 15&nbsp;inches (380&nbsp;mm) at the rear, and later still 15&nbsp;inches at the front as well. These enabled the use of more powerful brakes. Steel [[disc brakes]] were used on all four wheels and were of 10.5&nbsp;inches (270&nbsp;mm) diameter for the smaller wheels and 11&nbsp;inches (280&nbsp;mm) for the larger ones. The car ran on treaded [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] tyres throughout its racing career.<ref name="Nye1" />

The car continued Tauranac's reputation for producing cars that handled well. Brabham has since said: "The BT19 was beautifully balanced and I loved its readiness to [[Drifting (motorsport)|drift]] through fast curves."<ref>Brabham, Nye (2004) p.199</ref> Brabham referred to the car as his ''Old Nail''; Ron Tauranac is reported to have explained this as being "because it was two years old, great to drive and had no vices."<ref name="material" /><!--I don't understand the explanation (Awadewit)--><!-- Tell me about it. I will look again for a better explanation. 4u1e. -->

==Engine and transmission==
[[Image:Brabham BT19 1966 Germany.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The '''Brabham BT19''' during the [[1966 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]].]]
Repco's 620 series engine is a [[normally aspirated]] unit in a V8 configuration and uses [[aluminium]] alloy [[engine block]]s obtained from the abandoned [[Oldsmobile]] F85 engine project. The engine block, originally designed without cylinder liners, is fitted with [[cast iron]] cylinder liners by Repco. It is stiffened with two Repco [[magnesium]] alloy castings and features Repco-designed [[cylinder heads]] and chain driven [[single overhead camshaft]]s. The internals of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall [[crankshaft]], [[Daimler Motor Company|Daimler]] [[connecting rod]]s and specially cast [[piston]]s. The cylinder head design means that the engine's [[exhaust pipe]]s exit on the outer side of the block, and are therefore wrapped around the rear suspension, a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably.<ref name= "Nyeengine">Nye (1986) pp. 37&mdash;41</ref> The engine is [[water-cooled]], with oil and water radiators mounted in the nose.

The engine was light for its time, weighing around 340&nbsp;lb, compared to 500&nbsp;lb for the [[Maserati]] [[V12]],<ref>Henry (1985) p.66</ref> but in 3&nbsp;litre Formula One form only produced around 300&nbsp;[[brake horsepower]] (220&nbsp;[[Watt|kW]]) at under 8000&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute]] (rpm) compared to 330&ndash;360&nbsp;bhp (250&ndash;270&nbsp;kW) produced by the [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and Maserati V12s.<ref>Nye (1986) pp.151 & 155. Nye reports that Ferrari claimed 380&nbsp;bhp (280&nbsp;kW) for their V12, but believes 360&nbsp;bhp to be more likely. Maserati claimed 370&nbsp;bhp (275&nbsp;kW) for their V12. Nye gives 360&nbsp;bhp for the Maserati, but [[Roy Salvadori]], then manager of the Cooper team, has said that "330&nbsp;bhp [250&nbsp;kW] was about the most they ever gave" (Frankel (December 2006) p.52)</ref> However, it produced high levels of [[torque]] over a wide range of engine speeds from 3500&nbsp;rpm up to peak torque of 233&nbsp;[[pound-foot|pound feet]] (316&nbsp;[[Newton metre|Nm]]) at 6500&nbsp;rpm.<ref>Nye gives the torque as equivalent to 192&nbsp;[[pounds per square inch]] [[Mean effective pressure|Brake Mean effective pressure]]; this has been converted to the more familiar lb-ft using a conversion where Torque (lb ft) = (bmep (psi) x displacement (cu in))/150.8</ref> It was also relatively fuel efficient. On the car's debut Brabham reports that the car achieved 7&nbsp;[[Miles per gallon#Units|miles per gallon]] (40&nbsp;L/100&nbsp;km), against figures of around 4&nbsp;mpg (70&nbsp;L/100&nbsp;km) for its "more exotic rivals".<ref name="BrabNye1">Brabham, Nye (2004) p.191</ref> This, combined with the lightweight chassis, meant that it could start a Grand Prix with only 35&nbsp;[[Imperial units#Measures of volume|gallons]] (160&nbsp;litres) of fuel on board, compared to around 55&nbsp;gallons (250&nbsp;litres) for the [[Cooper T81]]-Maseratis.<ref name="Weights" /> The engine had one further advantage: parts were cheap. For example, the engine blocks were available for [[Pound Sterling|£]]11 each and the connecting rods cost £7 each.<ref name= "Nyeengine" />

The 740 series unit used in the three races for which the car was entered in 1967 uses a different, lighter, Repco-designed engine block. It also has redesigned cylinder heads, which, among other improvements, mean that its exhausts are mounted centrally and do not interfere with the suspension, unlike those of the 620 series.

The car was initially fitted with a [[Hewland]] HD (Heavy Duty) gearbox, originally designed for use with 2&nbsp;litre engines. This design was marginal for the more powerful 3&nbsp;litre engines, with the result that Brabham normally made very gentle starts, the start being the time the greatest loading is put through the gearbox. The HD was later replaced with the sturdier DG (Different Gearbox) design, produced at Brabham's request and later a popular choice by other constructors.<ref>Lawrence (1999) p.77</ref>

==Racing history==
Although regarded by its designer as a "lash-up", BT19 had a very successful Formula One racing career, almost entirely in the hands of Jack Brabham.<ref name="Nye1" /> In its first race, at the non-championship [[1966 South African Grand Prix]] on [[1 January]], it was the fastest car in the qualifying session ahead of the race, taking [[pole position]], and leading the majority of the race before the [[fuel injection]] pump seized. On [[3 July]] at the [[1966 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]] in [[Reims-Gueux]] Jack Brabham became the first man to win a Formula One world championship race in one of his own cars. He went on to win four consecutive races, adding the [[1966 British Grand Prix|British]], [[1966 Dutch Grand Prix|Dutch]] and [[1966 German Grand Prix|German]] Grands Prix to his victory in France. Although the BT20, the definitive 1966 car, had been available as early as the French Grand Prix, Jack Brabham continued to use BT19 until the [[1966 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]] on [[4 September]], at which he clinched the 1966 world championship. He used it once more to take pole position and victory at the non-championship [[Oulton Park Gold Cup]] before taking over a BT20 for the final two races of the championship season. The car was used again at three of the first four championship races in the [[1967 Formula One season]], taking second place at the [[1967 Dutch Grand Prix]].

Commenting on the reasons for the unexpected competitiveness of the 1966 Brabham-Repcos in Formula One, motorsport historian Doug Nye has suggested that they "could score on weight over the more powerful Ferrari, BRM, Cooper-Maserati, Eagle-Weslake and Honda in their undeveloped forms, and on sheer 'grunt' over such interim stop-gap cars as the nimble 2-litre Climax and BRM V8-engined Lotus 33s and BRMs."<ref>Nye (1986) p.43</ref>

BT19 also competed in the final two races of the 1965/66 [[Tasman Series]] in Australia with a 2.5&nbsp;litre (153&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in) version of the Repco engine, where it recorded one retirement and a third place. Tasman racing was the original purpose of the Repco engine and Brabham's involvement was supposed to promote the new engines. Frank Hallam, head of the Repco-Brabham organisation responsible for designing and building the Repco engines, has said that the 2.5&nbsp;litre version "never put out the power per litre that the 3&nbsp;litre engine produced",<ref>Pinder (1995) p.38</ref> which itself was not a powerful unit. The 2.5&nbsp;litre engine was not successful in Tasman competition.

==Demonstrations==
The car was not raced in serious competition after 1967. Jack Brabham retired and moved back to Australia at the end of 1970. He retained ownership of the car until 1976, when it passed into the hands of Repco and was restored by the Repco Engine Parts Group. In 1986, Automotive Components Ltd. (ACL) was formed by the [[management buyout]] of Engine Parts Group, which included the transfer of the BT19 to the new company. Since its restoration, the car has frequently been demonstrated at events, including the inaugural [[Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grands Prix]] in Adelaide (1985) and Melbourne (1996). It also appeared at the 2004 [[Goodwood Revival]] meeting in the United Kingdom. ACL sold the car back to Repco in 2004.<ref>[http://www.apajournal.com.au/article.asp?ArticleID=737 Australia's most famous car changes hands]</ref>

In 2002, at the inaugural "Speed on the Tweed" historic meeting at [[Murwillumbah]], where he again drove the BT19, Brabham commented: "It's been a wonderful car over the years and it's been very well looked after and it's a pleasure to come and drive it. Coming to Murwillumbah was a really good excuse to get back in the car and drive it again and I'm afraid that's something I'll never ever get tired of."<ref>George Negus Tonight</ref>
