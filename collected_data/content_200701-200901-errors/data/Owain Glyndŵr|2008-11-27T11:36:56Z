'''Owain Glyndŵr''' (pronounced {{IPA2|'owain glin'dwr}}), or '''Owain Glyn Dŵr''', [[anglicise]]d by [[Shakespeare]] into '''Owen Glendower''' (c. 1354 or 1359 – c. 1416) and crowned as '''Owain IV of Wales''', was the last native [[Welsh people|Welsh person]] to hold the title [[Prince of Wales]]. He instigated an ultimately unsuccessful but long-running [[revolt]] against [[England|English]] rule of [[Wales]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/glyn_dwr_owain.shtml bbc.co.uk Owain Glyn Dwr (c.1354 - c.1416) Historic Figures] </ref>

Glyndŵr was a descendant of the Princes of [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]] from his father [[Gruffydd Fychan II]], hereditary [[Tywysog]] of [[Powys Fadog]] and Lord of [[Glyndyfrdwy]], and of those of [[Deheubarth]] through his mother [[Elen ferch Tomas ap Llywelyn]]. On [[September 16]] [[1400]], Glyndŵr instigated the Welsh Revolt against the rule of [[Henry IV of England]]. Although initially successful, the uprising was eventually put down — Glyndŵr was last seen in 1412 and was never captured, nor tempted by Royal Pardons and never betrayed. His final years are a mystery.

Glyndŵr has remained a notable figure in the popular culture of both [[Wales]] and [[England]], portrayed in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s play Henry IV (as '''Owen Glendower''') as a wild and exotic man ruled by magic and emotion ("at my nativity, The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes, Of burning cressets, and at my birth The frame and huge foundation of the earth Shaked like a coward." — [[Henry IV Part 1]], Act 3, scene 1). In the late 19th century the "Young Wales" movement recreated him as the father of [[Welsh nationalism]], revising the historical image of him as a purely local leader and joining him in popular memory as a national hero on par with [[King Arthur]].

In 2000, celebrations were held all over Wales to commemorate the 600th anniversary of the Glyndŵr rising. Owain has since been voted in at 23rd in a poll of [[100 Greatest Britons]] in 2002.

==Early life==
[[Image:Glyndwr's Banner.svg|left|thumb|180px|Banner of Owain Glyndŵr]][[Image:Map of Wales within the United Kingdom.png|right|thumb|180px|Wales's location within the modern [[United Kingdom]] – [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] are shaded in pink.]]

Glyndŵr was born in c.1354 (possibly 1359) to a prosperous landed family, part of the Anglo-Welsh [[gentry]] of the [[Welsh Marches]] (the border between England and Wales) in northeast Wales. This group moved easily between Welsh and English societies and language, occupying important offices for the [[Marcher Lords]] while maintaining their position as ''uchelwyr'' — nobles descended from the pre-conquest Welsh Royal dynasties — in traditional Welsh society. His father, [[Gruffydd Fychan II]], Hereditary [[Tywysog]] of [[Powys Fadog]] and Lord of [[Glyndyfrdwy]], died some time before 1370 leaving Glyndŵr's mother Elen ferch Tomas ap Llywelyn of [[Deheubarth]] a widow and Owain a young man of maybe 16 years at most. Owain probably had an elder brother called Madog but he may have died young.

The young Owain ap Gruffydd was fostered at the home of [[David Hanmer]], a rising lawyer shortly to be a Justice of the Kings Bench. Owain is then thought to have been sent to London to study law at the [[Inns of Court]]. He probably studied as a legal [[apprentice]] for seven years; enough to get a good grasp of the [[law]] as a landowner but not enough to be known as a "Man of Law". He was probably in [[London]] during the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381. By 1383 he had returned to Wales, where he married David Hanmer's daughter, [[Margaret Hanmer|Margaret]], started his large family and established himself as the Squire of [[Sycharth]] and [[Glyndyfrdwy]] with all the responsibilities that entailed.

Glyndŵr entered the English king's military service in 1384 when he undertook garrison duty under the renowned 'Welshman' [[Sir Gregory Sais]], or Sir Degory Sais, on the English–Scottish border at [[Berwick-on-Tweed]]. In 1385 he saw action under [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] in his French wars as his scutifer (shield bearer) and later that year served King Richard under the command of [[John of Gaunt]] again in [[Scotland]]. In 1386 he was called to give evidence in the [[Scrope v. Grosvenor]] trial at Chester. In 1387, Owain was in southeast England under [[Richard Fitzalan, 11th Earl of Arundel]] in the Channel at the defeat of a Franco-Spanish-Flemish fleet off the coast of Kent. Upon the death of his father-in-law Sir [[David Hanmer]] in late 1387, knighted earlier that very year by Richard II, Glyndŵr returned to Wales as executor of his estate. He then served as a squire to Henry Bolingbroke (later [[Henry IV of England]]), son of [[John of Gaunt]], at the short, sharp [[Battle of Radcot Bridge]] in December 1387. He had gained three years concentrated military experience in different theatres and seen at first hand some key events and people. 

King Richard was distracted in growing conflict with the [[Lords Appellant]] from this time on. Glyndŵr's opportunities were further limited by the death of Sir Gregory Sais in 1390 and the sidelining of [[Richard Fitzalan, 11th Earl of Arundel]] and he gladly returned to his stable Welsh estates, living there quietly for ten years during his forties. The [[bard]] [[Iolo Goch]] ("Red Iolo"), himself a Welsh Lord, visited him throughout the 1390s and wrote a number of odes to Owain, praising Owain's liberality, and writing of [[Sycharth]] "Rare was it there / to see a latch or a lock."

==The Welsh revolt, 1400–15==
{{details|Glyndŵr Rising|this subject}}
In the late 1390s, a series of events occurred that began to push Owain towards rebellion, in what was later to be called the Welsh Revolt, the Glyndŵr Rising or the Last War of Independence. 

A series of events lead Owain to be proclaimed Prince of Wales on [[September 16]], [[1400]], by a small band of followers which included his eldest son, his brothers-in-law, and the [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] of [[St. Asaph]].

After a number of initial confrontations between King Henry IV and Owain's followers in September and October 1400, the revolt began to spread in 1401. The whole of northern and central Wales went over to Owain. King Henry appointed [[Henry Percy]] – the famous ‘Hotspur’ – to bring the country to order. Hotspur issued an amnesty in March which applied to all rebels with the exception of Owain and his cousins, Rhys and Gwilym, sons of [[Tudur ap Gronw]], (forefather of King [[Henry VII of England]]). Both the Tudors were pardonned after their capture of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]’s great castle at [[Conwy]].

In June, Owain scored his first major victory in the field at [[Mynydd Hyddgen]] on [[Pumlumon]]. Retaliation by King Henry IV on the [[Strata Florida Abbey]] followed, but eventually lead to Henry's retreat.

In 1402, the English parliament issued the [[Penal Laws against Wales 1402|Penal Laws against Wales]], anti-Welsh legislation designed to establish English dominance in Wales but actually pushing many Welshmen into the rebellion.

In the same year, Owain captured his arch enemy, [[Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn]]. He was to hold him for a year until he received a substantial ransom from King Henry. Paying back this debt effectively ruined de Grey financially. 

In June 1402 Sir [[Edmund Mortimer]], the uncle of the [[Earl of March]], was captured. Glyndŵr offered to release Mortimer for a large ransom but, in sharp contrast to his attitude to de Grey, Henry IV refused to pay. Mortimer could be said to have had a greater claim to the English throne than himself so his speedy release was not an option. In response, Sir Edmund negotiated an alliance with Owain and married one of Owain's daughters.

It is also in 1402 that mention of the [[French people|French]] and [[Brittany|Bretons]] helping Owain were first heard. The French were certainly hoping to use Wales as they had used Scotland as a base from which to fight the English.

1403 marks the year when the revolt became truly national in Wales. Royal officials reported that Welsh students at Oxford University were leaving their studies for Owain and Welsh labourers and craftsmen were abandoning their employers in England and returning to Wales. Owain could also draw on the seasoned troops from the English campaigns in France and Scotland. Hundreds of Welsh [[archer]]s and experienced [[men-at-arms]] left English service to join the rebellion.

In 1404, to demonstrate his seriousness as a ruler, Owain held Court at [[Harlech]] and appointed the devious and brilliant [[Gruffydd Young]] as his Chancellor. Soon afterwards he called his first Parliament (or more properly a {{lang|cy|''Cynulliad''}} or "gathering") of all Wales at [[Machynlleth]] where he was crowned '''Owain IV of Wales''' and announced his national programme. He declared his vision of an independent Welsh state with a parliament and separate Welsh church. There would be two national [[university|universities]] (one in the south and one in the north) and return to the [[Welsh law|traditional law]] of [[Hywel Dda]]. Senior churchmen and important members of society flowed to his banner. English resistance was reduced to a few isolated castles, walled towns, and [[fortified manor house]]s.

===Tripartite indenture and the year of the French===
Owain demonstrated his new status by negotiating the "Tripartite Indenture" with Edmund Mortimer and the Earl of Northumberland. The Indenture agreed to divide England and Wales between the three of them. Wales would extend as far as the rivers [[River Severn|Severn]] and [[River Mersey|Mersey]] including most of [[Cheshire]], [[Shropshire]], and [[Herefordshire]]. The [[Mortimer]] Lords of March would take all of southern and western England and [[Thomas Percy, 1st Earl of Worcester]], would take the north of England. Most historians have dismissed the Indenture as a flight of fantasy.

[[Image:Owain Glyndwr.jpg|thumb|left|Owain Glyndŵr]]
 
Things were improving on the international front too. Although negotiations with the [[Scottish people|Scots]] and the Lords of [[Ireland]] were unsuccessful, Owain had reasons to hope that the French and [[Bretons]] might be more welcoming. Quickly Owain dispatched [[Gruffydd Young]] and his brother-in-law, John Hanmer, to  with the French. The result was a formal treaty that promised French aid to Owain and the Welsh. The immediate effect seems to have been that joint Welsh and Franco-Breton forces attacked and laid siege to [[Kidwelly Castle]]. The Welsh could also count on semi-official fraternal aid from their fellow [[Celts]] in the then independent [[Brittany]] and [[Scotland]]. Scots and French privateers were operating around Wales throughout Owain’s war. Scots ships had raided English settlements on the [[Lleyn peninsula|Llyn Peninsula]] in 1400 and 1401. In 1403 a Breton squadron defeated the English in the Channel and devastated [[Jersey]], [[Guernsey]] and [[Plymouth]] while the French made a landing on the [[Isle of Wight]]. By 1404 they were raiding the coast of England, with Welsh troops on board, setting fire to [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] and devastating the coasts of [[Devon]].

1405 was the "Year of the French" in Wales. A formal [[treaty]] between Wales and France was negotiated. On the continent the French pressed the English as the French army invaded English [[Aquitaine]]. Simultaneously, the French landed in force at [[Milford Haven]] in west Wales. They marched through [[Herefordshire]] and on into [[Worcestershire]]. They met the English army just ten miles from [[Worcester]]. The armies took up battle positions daily and viewed each other from a mile without any major action for eight days. Then, for reasons that have never been clear, both sides withdrew.

===The rebellion founders===
[[Image:Charles VI the Well-Beloved.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Charles VI of France]] did not continue to support Glyndŵr's revolt]]

By 1406, most French forces had withdrawn after politics shifted in Paris toward the peace party. Even Owain's so-called "[[Pennal]] Letter", in which he promised [[Charles VI of France]] and [[Avignon Pope Benedict XIII]] to shift the allegiance of the Welsh Church from [[Rome]] to [[Avignon]], produced no effect.

There were other signs the revolt was encountering problems. Early in the year Owain’s forces suffered several defeats. King Henry also showed that the English were engaged in more and more ruthless tactics. More serious for the rebellion, English forces landed in Anglesey from Ireland and would gradually push the Welsh back until the resistance in Anglesey formally ended toward the end of 1406.

At the same time, the English were adopting a different strategy. Rather than focusing on punitive expeditions favoured by his father, the young Henry of Monmouth adopted a strategy of economic blockade. Using the castles that remained in English control he gradually began to retake Wales while cutting off trade and the supply of weapons. By 1407 this strategy was beginning to bear fruit. One by one the Lordships began to surrender. In the autumn, Owain’s [[Aberystwyth Castle]] surrendered. In 1409 it was the turn of [[Harlech Castle]]. [[Edmund Mortimer]] died in the final battle and Owain’s wife Margaret along with two of his daughters (including Catrin) and three of his Mortimer granddaughters were taken prisoner and incarcerated in the [[Tower of London]]. They were all to die in the Tower before 1415.

Owain remained free but now was a hunted guerilla leader. The revolt continued to splutter on. In 1410, after a [[suicide]] raid into [[Shropshire]], many of the leading rebellion figures were captured. 

In 1412, Owain captured, and later ransomed, a leading [[Wales|Welsh]] supporter of King Henry's, [[Dafydd Gam]] ("Crooked David"), in an ambush in [[Brecon]]. These were the last flashes of the revolt. This was the last time that Owain was seen alive by his enemies. As late as 1414, there were rumours that the [[Herefordshire]] based [[Lollard]] leader, Sir [[John Oldcastle]], was communicating with Owain and reinforcements were sent to the major castles in the north and south. 

But by then things were changing. King Henry IV died in 1413 and his son [[King Henry V]] began to adopt a more conciliatory attitude to the Welsh. Royal Pardons were offered to the major leaders of the revolt and other opponents of his father's regime.

==Disappearance and legacy==
Nothing certain is now known of Owain after 1412. Despite enormous rewards being offered, he was never captured nor betrayed. He ignored Royal Pardons. Tradition has it that he either died and was buried at his estate in [[Sycharth]] or on the estates of his daughters' husbands — [[Kentchurch]] in south [[Herefordshire]] or [[Monnington]] in west Herefordshire, ironically both in England. Owain's daughter, [[Alys ferch Owain Glyndŵr|Alys]], had married, secretly, [[Sir John Scudamore]], the King's appointed Sheriff of Herefordshire. Somehow he had weathered the rebellion and remained in office. It was rumoured that Owain finally retreated to their home at Kentchurch. In his book "The Mystery of Jack of Kent and the Fate of Owain Glyndŵr", Alex Gibbon argues that the folk hero Jack of Kent, also known as Siôn Cent – the family [[chaplain]] of the Scudamore family – was in fact Owain Glyndŵr himself. Gibbon points out a number of similarities between [[Siôn Cent]] and Glyndŵr (including physical appearance, age, education, character) and claims that Owain spent his last years living with Alys passing himself off as an aging [[Franciscan]] [[friar]] and family tutor. There are many folktales of Glyndŵr donning disguises to gain advantage over opponents during the rebellion.

A grandchild of the Scudamore's was [[Sir John Donne]] (d. 1503) of [[Kidwelly]], a successful [[Yorkist]] [[courtier]], [[diplomat]] and soldier, who after 1485 made an accommodation with his fellow-Welshman [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]. Through the Donne family many prominent English families are then descended from Owain, including the [[De Vere]] family, successive holders of the title [[Earl of Oxford]] and the [[Cavendish]] family as [[Duke of Devonshire]].

In 2006 The [[Owain Glyndwr Society]]'s president Adrien Jones said: "Four years ago we visited a direct descendant of Glyndwr, [Sir John Scudamore], at Kentchurch Court, near Abergavenny. "He took us to Monnington Straddel, in Herefordshire, where one of Glyndwr's daughters, Alice [Alys], had lived. [He] told us that he (Glyndŵr) spent his last days there and eventually died there. It was a family secret for 600 years and even [Sir John]'s mother, who died shortly before we visited, refused to reveal the secret. There's even a mound where he is believed to be buried at Monnington Straddel." [http://www.owain-glyndwr-soc.org.uk/achievements.htm#burial%20site]

==Modern legacy==
Owain is perhaps best remembered outside Wales as the [[caricature]]d Welshman of 'Owen Glendower' in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry IV, Part One]]'' who claims to be able to "call spirits from the vasty deep". In common with the myth of [[Merlin]] this places Owain as a [[druid]]ic mystic and — bluntly — a windbag.

After Owain's death, there was little resistance to English rule until, in the 16th century, the [[Tudor dynasty]], whilst allowing Welshmen to become more prominent in English society, saw Owain's revolt as a catastrophe for Wales. In ''Henry IV'' [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] portrays him as wild and exotic; a man ruled by magic and emotion in sharp contrast to the logical and reasonable Hotspur. It was not until the late 19th century that Owain's reputation was to be revived. The "[[Cymru Fydd|Young Wales]]" movement recreated him as the father of Welsh nationalism. The discovery of Owain's Great Seal and his letters to the French in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]] helped revise historical images of him as a purely local leader. In the [[First World War]], the Welsh [[Prime Minister]], [[David Lloyd George]], unveiled a statue to him in [[Cardiff]] town hall and a postcard showing Owain at the [[Battle of Mynydd Hyddgen]] was sold to raise money for wounded Welsh soldiers. Folk memory in Wales had always held him in high regard and almost every parish has some landmark or story about Owain. 

He joined the long list of failed resistance to English rule in the British Isles, was remembered as a national hero on a par with [[King Arthur]] and numerous small groups have adopted his symbolism to advocate independence or nationalism for Wales. For example, during the 1980s, a group calling themselves "[[Meibion Glyndwr]]" claimed responsibility for the burning of English holiday homes in Wales. However, perhaps ironically, Glyndŵr was part English himself. Welsh legend states that when Wales is threatened again then he will rise from the his unknown resting place in order to lead the defence of Wales, quite like the legend of [[King Arthur]]. The creation of the [[National Assembly for Wales]] brought him back into the spotlight and in 2000 celebrations were held all over Wales to commemorate the 600th anniversary of the rising. Stamps were issued with his likeness and streets, parks, and public squares were named after him throughout Wales. Owain’s personal standard — the quartered arms of Powys and Deheubarth rampant — began to be seen all over Wales, especially at [[rugby union]] matches against the English. An energetic campaign exists to make [[September 16]], the date Owain raised his standard, a [[public holiday|national holiday]] in Wales. An annual award for achievement in the arts and literature, the [[Glyndŵr Award]], is named after him. In 2007, popular Welsh musicians the [[Manic Street Preachers]] wrote a song entitled '1404' based on Owain Glyndŵr. The song can be found on the CD single for '[[Autumnsong]]'. A statue of Owain Glyndŵr on horseback was installed in 2007 in The Square in [[Corwen]], [[Denbighshire]] to commemorate his life and his lasting influence on Wales. The waymarked [[long distance footpath]] [[Glyndwr's Way]] runs through [[Mid Wales]] near to his homelands.

In 2008, [[Glyndŵr University]] was established in [[Wrexham]], Wales. Originally established as the Wrexham School of Science and Art in 1887, it was until the name change known as the North East Wales Institute or "NEWI"). Glyndŵr was born and lived much of his live around Wrexham and the Welsh Marches.

==Fiction==
As well as in Shakespeare, Glyndŵr, has been featured in a number of works of literature and is the subject of several historical novels, including:
*[[John Cowper Powys]]: ''[[Owen Glendower (novel)|Owen Glendower]]''
*[[Martha Rofheart]]: ''Cry 'God for Glendower''' (1973)
*[[Edith Pargeter]]: ''A Bloody Field by Shrewsbury''
*[[Malcolm Pryce]]: ''A Dragon to Agincourt'' - Y Lolfa ISBN 0-86243-684-2

He is also a character in [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Henry IV, part 1]] and was the hero of James Hill's UK TV movie ''Owain, Prince of Wales'', broadcast in 1983 in the early days of Channel 4/S4C.

He also has a small role as a past Knight of the Word and a ghost who serves the Lady in Terry Brooks' [[Word/Void]] trilogy. In the books, he is [[John Ross (Shannara)|John Ross]]' ancestor.

For a study of the various ways Glyndŵr has been portrayed in Welsh-language literature of the modern period, see E. Wyn James, ''Glyndŵr a Gobaith y Genedl: Agweddau ar y Portread o Owain Glyndŵr yn Llenyddiaeth y Cyfnod Modern'' (Aberystwyth: Cymdeithas Lyfrau Ceredigion, 2007).
