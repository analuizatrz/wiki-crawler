'''Madeira''' ({{pronounced|mɐdeiɾɐ}} or {{IPA|[mɐˈdɐiʀɐ]}}) is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[archipelago]] in the north [[Atlantic Ocean]] that lies between {{coord|32|22.3|N|16|16.5|W}} and {{coord|33|7.8|N|17|16.65|W}}. It is one of the [[Autonomous regions of Portugal]], with '''Madeira Island''' and '''[[Porto Santo]] Island''' being the only inhabited [[islands]]. Although located in the [[African Plate]], some 650&nbsp;km (360&nbsp;mi) off the [[North Africa]]n coast, Madeira belongs and has always belonged ethnically, culturally, economically and politically to [[Europe]], some 955&nbsp;km (583&nbsp;mi) from the European mainland.{{what}}

[[Madeira]] was rediscovered by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] sailors some time between [[1418]] and [[1420]]. The archipelago is considered to be the first discovery of the exploratory period initiated by [[Henry the Navigator]] of [[Portugal]]. It is a popular year-round [[resort]], noted for its [[Madeira wine]], flowers, and embroidery artisans, as well as its New Year's Eve celebrations that feature a spectacular [[fireworks show]], which is the largest in the [[world]] according to the [[Guinness World Records]]<ref>[http://www.madeiratourism.com/pls/madeira/wsmwdet0.detalhe_conteudo?p_cot_id=960&p_lingua=en&p_sub=1 Madeira “largest firework display in the world”]</ref>. Its harbour - [[Funchal]] - is important due to its commercial and passenger traffic and for being a major stopover for cruisers en route from [[Europe]] to the [[Caribbean]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Madeira}}
[[Image:Sé church Funchal.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Cathedral]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Funchal]].]]
===Pre-Portuguese times===
[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] mentions certain Purple Islands, the position of which with reference to the [[Fortunate Islands]], or [[Canary Islands|Canaries]], may indicate Madeira islands. Plutarch (''Sertorius'', 75 AD) referring to the military commander [[Quintus Sertorius]] (d. 72 BC), relates that after his return to [[Cadiz]], "he met seamen recently arrived from Atlantic islands, two in number, divided from one another only by a narrow channel and distant from the coast of Africa 10,000 [[furlong]]s. They are called Isles of the Blest." The estimated distance from Africa, and the closeness of the two islands, seem to indicate Madeira and [[Porto Santo]]. A small village in Madeira Called 'Mere Ne Puddi' Is described as Heaven on earth in the summer, but Hell on earth in the winter, It is filled with beautiful Valleys.

There is a romantic tale about two lovers, Robert Machim and Anna d'Arfet in time of the King [[Edward III of England]], fleeing from [[England]] to [[France]] in 1346, were driven off their course by a violent storm, and cast on the coast of Madeira at the place subsequently named [[Machico]], in memory of one of them. On the evidence of a [[portolan]] dated 1351, preserved at [[Florence, Italy]], it would appear that Madeira had been discovered long before that date by Portuguese vessels under [[Genoa|Genoese]] captains.

===Portuguese discovery===
[[Image:Funchal ( Portugal )13.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Statue of [[João Gonçalves Zarco]].]]
In 1419 two captains of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], [[João Gonçalves Zarco]] and [[Tristão Vaz Teixeira]], were driven by a storm to the island they named [[Porto Santo Island|Porto Santo]].  They gave this name (meaning Holy Harbour) in gratitude for their rescue from shipwreck. The next year an expedition was sent to populate the island, in which the two captains, together with captain [[Bartolomeu Perestrello]], took possession of the islands on behalf of the Portuguese crown.

The islands started to be settled circa 1420 or 1425. In [[September 23]], [[1433]], the name ''Ilha da Madeira'' (Madeira Island or "wood island") appears in a map, by the first time, in a document.

The three [[captain-major]]s had led, in the first trip, the respective families, a small group of people of the minor [[nobility]], people of modest conditions and some old prisoners of the kingdom. To gain the minimum conditions for the development of [[agriculture]], they had to rough-hew a part of the dense forest of [[laurisilva]] and to construct a large number of canals ([[levada]]s), since in some parts of the island, they had water in excess while in other parts water was scarce. In the earliest times, [[fish]] constituted about half of the settlers' diet, together with vegetables and fruit. The first local agricultural activity with some success was the raising of [[wheat]]. Initially, the colonists produced wheat for their own sustenance, but later began to export wheat to Portugal.

The discoveries of Porto Santo and Madeira were first described by [[Gomes Eanes de Zurara]] in ''Chronica da Descoberta e Conquista da Guiné''. (Eng. version by Edgar Prestage in 2 vols. issued by the Hakluyt Society, London, 1896-1899: ''The Chronicle of Discovery and Conquest of Guinea''.) [[Arkan Simaan]] relates these discoveries in French in his novel based on Azurara's Chronicle: ''L’Écuyer d’Henri le Navigateur'', published by Éditions l’Harmattan, Paris.

===Portuguese Madeira===
However, in time grain production began to fall. To get past the ensuing crisis [[Henry the Navigator|Henry]] decided to order the planting of [[sugarcane]] - rare in [[Europe]] and, therefore, considered a [[spice]] - promoting, for this, the introduction of [[Sicily|Sicilian]] beets as the first specialized plant and the technology of its agriculture. Sugarcane production became a leading factor in the island's economy, and increased the demand for labour. Genoese and Portuguese traders were attracted to the islands. Sugarcane cultivation and the sugar production industry developed until the 17th century. 

Since the 17th century, Madeira's most important product has been its [[wine]], [[sugar]] production having since moved on to [[Brazil]], [[São Tomé and Principe]], and elsewhere.  Madeira wine was perhaps the most popular luxury beverage in the colonial Western Hemisphere during the 17th and 18th centuries.  The [[British Empire]] occupied Madeira as a result of the [[Peninsular War|Napoleonic Wars]], a friendly occupation, which started in 1807 concluding in 1814, when the island was returned to [[Portugal]], and the [[British Empire|British]] did much to popularise [[Madeira Wine]]. 

When, after the death of king [[John VI of Portugal]], his usurper son [[Miguel of Portugal]] seized power from the rightful heir, his niece [[Maria II]], and proclaimed himself 'Absolute King', Madeira held out for the Queen under the governor [[José Travassos Valdez]] until Miguel sent an expeditionary force and the defence of the island was overwhelmed by crushing force. Valdez was forced to flee to England under the protection of the Royal Navy (September 1828).

In 1921, the last [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Emperor [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I]] was deported to Madeira, after his second  unsuccessful [[coup d'état]] in [[Hungary]]. He died there one year later and is buried in [[Monte (Funchal)|Monte]].

In [[July 1]] [[1976]], following the [[Carnation revolution|democratic revolution]] of 1974, Portugal granted political autonomy to Madeira. The region now has its own government and legislative assembly.

==Geography and climate==
[[Image:BicaDaCana1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|View from Bica da Cana.]]

[[Funchal]], the capital of Madeira Autonomous Region,is the chief city
and on the south coast of [[Madeira]],the principal island,in the archipelago. {{coord|32|37.75|N|16|55.3|W}}.
Other cities are: [[Vila Baleira]]) (in [[Porto Santo Island]]), [[Câmara de Lobos]], [[Machico]], [[Santa Cruz, Madeira|Santa Cruz]], [[Santana, Madeira|Santana]] and [[Caniço]] (Santa Cruz municipality), [[Madeira Island]].

The archipelago lies about 360&nbsp;miles from the coast of Africa, 535&nbsp;miles from [[Lisbon]], 230&nbsp;miles from [[Gran Canaria]], and 480&nbsp;miles from [[Santa Maria Island|Santa Maria]], the nearest of the [[Azores]].
[[Image:Madeira island.gif|thumb|left|200px|Map of the islands.]]
Madeira Island is the largest island of the group with an area of 741&nbsp;km², a length of 30 geographical miles (57&nbsp;km), a breadth of 13&nbsp;miles (22&nbsp;km) at its widest point, and a coastline of 80 to 90&nbsp;miles. Its longer axis lies east and west, along which lies a mountain chain with a mean altitude of 4,000&nbsp;feet (1,220&nbsp;m), considered the backbone of the island from which many deep ravines radiate outward to the coast. Its most famous sea cliff, the [[Cabo Girão]], is the world's second highest. The highest point on the island is [[Pico Ruivo]], at 1,862&nbsp;meters (6,107&nbsp;ft).<ref>[http://www.madeirahelp.com/madeira_geography MadeiraHelp.com]</ref>

In the south, there is very little left of the indigenous [[laurisilva]] subtropical rainforest which once covered the whole island (the original settlers set fire to the island to clear the land for farming) and gave it the name it now bears (''Madeira'' means "wood" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]). However, in the north, the valleys contain native trees of fine growth. These laurisilva forests, notably the forests on the northern slopes of Madeira Island, are designated a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].

A long, narrow, and comparatively low rocky promontory forms the eastern extremity of the island, on which lies a tract of calcareous sand known as the Fossil Bed. It contains land shells and numerous bodies resembling the roots of trees, probably produced by infiltration.

Madeira Island's geographical position and mountainous landscape result in a very pleasant climate which varies between the north side, south side, and smaller islands groups like Porto Santo and Savages. The mean annual temperature on the coastline can reach more than 20°C in the south. With its mild humidity, the weather of the island is classified as oceanic subtropical and with its low rain level, desertic on the Savages. Influenced by the [[Gulf Stream]], sea water temperature varies between 26°C during the summer and 17°C in the winter.

===Funchal===
[[Image:Funchal Pico da Cruz.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Funchal]]]]
Today [[Funchal]] is a modern city with more than 100,000 inhabitants. [[Funchal]] is located in a unique area; the natural geological features form an "[[amphitheatre]]" surrounding the city, which begins at the harbour (Porto de Funchal) and rises almost 1200&nbsp;metres high on gentle slopes. This provides a natural shelter and was what attracted the first settlers.

Madeira's [[Capital (political)|capital]] for more than five centuries, Funchal, is said to have been named as such because of the abundance of [[fennel]] (''funcho'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) growing there.

The harbour and [[climate]] combined with an excellent geographical position allowed Funchal to have a rapid population growth.

Probably the most central point is the Sé [[Cathedral]]. Built between 1493 and 1514 by Pêro Annes in [[Manueline]] style it represents one of Madeira's numerous treasures.

Madeira Island is the top of a massive [[shield volcano]] that rises about 6&nbsp;km from the floor of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], on an underwater mountain range called Tore, which stands on the [[African plate]]. The volcano formed atop an east-west [[rift]] in the [[oceanic crust]]. Construction of the bulk of the volcano began during the [[Miocene]] Epoch over 5&nbsp;million years ago and continued into the [[Pleistocene]] until about 700,000&nbsp;years ago.  This was followed by extensive [[erosion]], producing two large amphitheaters open to south in the central part of the island. 

Volcanic activity later resumed, producing [[scoria cone]]s and [[lava flow]]s atop the older eroded shield. The most recent volcanic eruptions were on the west-central part of the island only 6,500&nbsp;years ago, creating more [[cinder cone]]s and lava flows.

===Biodiversity===
[[Image:Madeira-flowers hg.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Typical Madeiran flowers]]
[[Image:Pieris wollastoni-PD.png|thumb|right|125px|Madeiran Large White (female)]]
Madeira has three [[endemism in birds|endemic]] birds: [[Zino's Petrel]], the [[Trocaz pigeon]] and the [[Madeira Firecrest]].

It is also of importance for other breeding [[seabird]]s, including the [[Madeiran Storm-petrel]], [[North Atlantic Little Shearwater]] and [[Cory's Shearwater]].

The [[Macaronesia]] region harbours an important floral diversity. In fact, the archipelago's forest composition and maturity are quite similar to the forests found in the [[Tertiary period]] that covered [[Southern Europe]] and [[Northern Africa]] millions of years ago.

The great [[biodiversity]] of Madeira is phytogeographically linked to the [[Mediterranean]] region, [[Africa]], [[Americas|America]] and [[Australia]], and interest in this phytogeography has been increasing in recent years due to the discovery of some epiphytic bryophyte species with non-adjacent distribution.
Madeira also has many endemic species of fauna – mostly invertebrates which include the extremely rare [[Madeiran Large White]] but also some vertebrates such as the native bat, some lizards species, and some birds as already mentioned.
These islands have more than 200 species of land molluscs (snails and slugs), some with very unusual shell shape and colours.

===Levadas===
[[Image:Levada.jpg|thumb|125px|A [[Levada]].]]
{{main|Levada}}
The island of Madeira is wet in the northwest but dry in the southeast. In the 16th century the Portuguese started building levadas to carry water to the agricultural regions. The most recent was made in the 1940s. Madeira is very mountainous, and building the levadas was often difficult. Many are cut into the sides of mountains, and it was also necessary to dig 25&nbsp;miles of tunnels.

Today the levadas not only supply water to the southern parts of the island but provide [[hydro-electric power]]. There are over 1350&nbsp;miles of levadas and they provide a remarkable network of walking paths. Some provide easy and relaxing walks through beautiful countryside, but others are narrow, crumbling ledges where a slip could result in serious injury or death.

Two of the most popular levadas to hike are the ''Levada do Caldeirão Verde'' and the ''Levada do Caldeirão do Inferno'' which should not be attempted by hikers prone to vertigo or without torches and helmets. The ''Levada do Caniçal'' is a much easier walk, running 7.1&nbsp;miles from Maroços to the ''Caniçal Tunnel''. It is known as the ''mimosa levada'' because [[Mimosa|mimosa trees]] are found all along the route.

==Economy==
[[Image:AIDAblu-Madeira.jpg|thumb|150px|The port of [[Funchal]]]]
The setting-up of the [[Free trade zone]] has led to the installation, under more favourable conditions, of infrastructure, production shops and essential services for small and medium-sized industrial enterprises. The Free Zone of Madeira, also called the Madeira International Business Centre, being a tax-privileged economic area, provides an incentive for companies, offering them financial and tax advantages via a whole range of activities exercised in the Industrial Free Zone, the Off-Shore Financial Centre, the International Shipping Register organisation, and the International Service Centre. 

The services sector makes the largest contribution to the formation of the regional gross value added as opposed to the [[agricultural sector]], for which the share has continuously declined in the regional economy.

Over the last few years, the regional economy has managed to open up and establish more internal and external competitiveness, so that its companies have become internationalised.

The largest industries are associated with the activities of food, [[beverages]] (and especially [[Madeira wine]]) and [[construction]].

===Tourism===
[[Tourism]] is an important sector in the region's economy since it contributes 20% to the region's [[GDP]], providing support throughout the year for [[commerce|commercial]], [[transport]] and other activities and constituting a significant market for local products. The share in Gross Value Added of hotels and [[restaurants]] (9%) also highlights this phenomenon. The island of [[Porto Santo]], with its 9&nbsp;km long beach and its climate, is totally devoted to tourism. Over the past decade it has recorded a substantial increase in its hotel accommodation capacity. 

Development in Madeira is considered to have potential since the necessary infrastructure has been established and adequate investment incentives have been introduced for expanding its hotel and catering structure in a controlled manner.  Conservation of its nature is important as it is one of tourists' main reasons for visiting Madeira.

Visitors are mainly from the [[European Union]], with [[Germany|German]], [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Scandinavia]]n and  [[Portugal|Portuguese]] tourists providing the main contingents. The average annual occupancy rate was 57.4% in 2001, reaching its maximum in March and April, when it exceeds 70%.
<div style="clear:left;"></div>

===Transport===
{{main|Transport in Madeira}}
[[Image:Flughafen Madeira 1.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Madeira Airport]]]]
The Islands have two airports, [[Funchal Airport]] on the Island of Madeira and the other in the island of [[Porto Santo]]. Flights to the islands are mostly made from [[Lisbon]] and [[Porto]], but there are also direct flights from other major European cities and other countries, like [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]] and [[South Africa]]. 

In the past Funchal airport, was infamous for its runway, which was short and was built on a high embankment but which fell away abruptly to the sea and was often troubled by difficult upwinds which tended to uplift aircraft when landing. In the past the largest airliners that were able to use the airport were the [[Airbus A320]] and [[Boeing 737]] and in [[1977]] a [[Boeing 727]] aircraft when landing in unfavorable weather ran off the cliff at the end of the runway causing over 150 deaths.<ref>[http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=11191977%AE=CS-TBR&airline=TAP+Portugal Funchal Aircraft Disaster of 19 November 1977]</ref> Recently, however, the runway has been realigned and extended from 1800m to 2481m, enabling almost any modern airliner to visit the island, including the [[Boeing 747-400]], one of the biggest airliners today.

[[European Union]] citizens of the [[Schengen Treaty]] area can enter the islands freely, while those from other regions need identification. 

Transport between the two main islands is done by plane or by ferries, the latter also allowing for the transportation of vehicles. Visiting the interior of the islands is now very easy, due to major road developments, known as the Via Rapids, on the islands during Portugal's economic boom. Modern roads reach all points of interest on the islands. The old, curving mountain roads are still an excellent way to tour the island. Funchal has an extensive public transportation system. Bus companies, including Horários do Funchal which has been operating for over a hundred years, have regularly scheduled routes to all points of interest on the island.

==Society and Culture==
===Demographics===
When the Portuguese discovered the island of Madeira in 1419, it was completely uninhabited by humans, with no [[aboriginal]] population at all. The island was settled by [[Portuguese people]], especially farmers from the [[Minho (province)|Minho]] region<ref>[http://www.ceha-madeira.net/livros/infante.html Alberto Vieira, ''O Infante e a Madeira: dúvidas e certezas, Centro Estudos História Atlântico.]</ref>, meaning that ''Madeirans'' ({{lang-pt|Madeirenses}}), as they are called, are ethnic Portuguese, though they have developed their own distinct regional identity and cultural traits.

The region has a total population of just under 250,000 inhabitants, the majority of whom live on the main island of Madeira where the population density is 337/km²; meanwhile only around 4,500 live on the [[Porto Santo Island]] where the population density is 112/km².

Traditional pastries in Madeira usually contain local ingredients, one of the most common being ''mel de cana'', literally ''sugarcane honey'' - molasses. The traditional cake of Madeira is called "Bolo de mel", which translates as (Sugarcane) "Honey Cake" and according to custom is never cut with a knife but broken into pieces by hand. It is a rich and heavy cake. Visitors to the island will see plentiful examples of handicraft on sale in shops. The islands have historical monuments, streets and plazas (''praças'') with many gardens and typical small towns.
