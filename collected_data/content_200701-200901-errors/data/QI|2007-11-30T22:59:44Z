'''''QI''''', standing for ''Quite Interesting'', is a comedy [[panel game]] television [[quiz show]] created and produced by [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]], hosted by [[Stephen Fry]], and featuring regular panellist [[Alan Davies]]. New episodes are broadcast initially on [[BBC Four]] on Friday evenings at 22:30 and repeated on [[BBC Two]] the following Friday at 22:00. Syndicated episodes of previous series are shown on [[Dave (channel)|Dave]]. ''QI'' has the highest viewing figures for any show on BBC Four.<ref>[http://www.qi.com/tv/audience.php ''QI''.com] Audience figures. Accessed [[21 June]], [[2007]].</ref>

It is distinguished by the awarding of points not necessarily for ''correct'' answers, but rather, for (quite) ''interesting'' ones. Many of the questions are extremely obscure, making it unlikely that the correct answer will be given. Points are deducted from a panellist who gives an ''obvious but wrong'' answer, typically one that is generally accepted as true but is, in fact, false.

== Format and conception ==
The panel consists of four panellists: three rotating and one regular, Alan Davies, who has the seat to Stephen Fry's right. Davies has appeared in every episode, except in one episode themed on "Divination". He appeared at the beginning, but "teleported" away during the buzzer demonstration. He was at a football match instead but was still able to play as communicated "from beyond."<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (D series)|Divination]] | series = QI | airdate = 2006-11-24 | season = D | number = 10 }}</ref> He has only won five times: since he generally offers up most of the "obvious but wrong" answers, he frequently finishes in last place. The show's other panellists mainly come from a [[stand-up comedy]] background, although there have also been entertainment personalities from many fields, including [[Richard E. Grant]], [[Jeremy Clarkson]] and [[Gyles Brandreth]].

Questions are sometimes misleading or very difficult. Providing an "obvious but wrong" answer results in a sequence of humiliating [[klaxon]]s. In the first and second series, Fry produced the answer on a card to show the panellists, while it also flashed on the large screens behind them (except in the pilot episode and the first show of the first series, when only the cards were used).<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (A series)|Series A, Episode 1]] | series = QI | airdate = 2003-09-11 | season = A | number = 1 }}</ref> In the third series and onward, Fry's answer cards were dispensed with altogether, leaving only the screens as proof that the answers given had been predicted.

Because of the show's expectation that hardly anyone would be able to give a correct answer without significant prompting, it instead encourages sheer interestingness, which is how points are mainly scored.<ref name="Factoid">''QI Series 1 DVD'' Factoids</ref> As such, tangential discussions are encouraged, for panellists are apt to branch off into frivolous conversations, give voice to train of thought, and share humorous anecdotes from their own lives.<ref name="Factoid"/> The number of points given and taken away are normally decided by Fry or beforehand by the researchers, especially if the points given or taken are very large. For example, one episode asked, "What is the main ingredient of air?" If someone answered, "[[Carbon dioxide]]" then 3,000 points would have been deducted, but no-one gave this answer. However, Davies was deducted 10 points for saying, "[[Oxygen]]".<ref name="SAE4">{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (A series)|Series A, Episode 4]] | series = QI | airdate = 2003-10-02 | season = A | number = 4}}</ref> Fry once said:

<blockquote>"Now, the rules are simple. Scoring is ''my'' business. Points are given and points are taken away. They are taken away for answers which are both obvious and wrong, and they're given not so much for being correct but for being interesting. Their level of interestingness is impartially determined by a demographically selected customer-service focus consultancy, broken down by age and sex - i.e. me. Because there is no-one more broken down by age and sex."<ref name="SAE10">{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (A series)|Series A, Episode 10]] | series = QI | airdate = 2003-11-13 | season = A | number = 10}}</ref></blockquote>

John Lloyd, ''QI's'' creator, has admitted that not even he has any idea on how the scoring system works, but there is someone who is paid to check on the scores. Guests are allowed the right of appeal if they believe their score is wrong, but no-one has done this so far.<ref name="Factoid"/>

=== Buzzers ===
Each of the panel has a [[buzzer]], the sounds of all four often being based along some sort of theme. The sounds are demonstrated at the beginning of the programme, but are sometimes changed in some way for repeated use. Davies' buzzer usually contradicts the others' in some amusing way, and has been the last to be demonstrated in every episode except for the unbroadcast pilot, in which he went first and [[Eddie Izzard]], with a sillier buzzer, went last.<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (A series)|Pilot]] | series = QI }}</ref> In one instance in Series A, rather than a comical buzzer, Alan set off the forfeit alarm, meaning he started the show on -10 points before a question was asked.

=== General Ignorance ===
{{seealso|The Book of General Ignorance}}
[[Image:QIfront.JPG|thumb|225px|right|Stephen Fry presenting an episode of ''QI''.]]
In a parody of ubiquitous [[general knowledge]] quizzes, the final round is off-topic and called "General Ignorance", focusing upon seemingly easy questions which have ''obvious but wrong'' answers. Whereas in the main rounds of the show, the panellists' use of buzzers is not usually enforced, the "General Ignorance" questions are introduced by Fry's reminder to keep "fingers on buzzers".

Due to the large number of "obvious but wrong" answers, panellists usually incur the greatest point losses in this round. In the second series' Christmas episode, Davies stated his refusal to participate in General Ignorance, saying that he "will not ''be'' humiliated at Christmas". In response, Fry offered to switch places with him, to the delight of the audience. Despite the seeming spontaneity of the swap, it was undoubtedly pre-planned (at least on the part of Davies and the producers), as evidenced by the fact that Davies, in turn, produced his own set of questions on loose-leaf paper (most of which he directed at Fry), and also by the photographs and obvious-answer graphics which accompanied Davies' questions.  At the end of the show, Fry announced that the game's loser was, in fact, Fry himself, as a result of his falling into many of Davies's traps.<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (B series)|B Christmas Special]] | series = QI | airdate = 2004-12-26 | season = B | number = 12 }}</ref>

=== Extra tasks ===
In some episodes, panellists are given an extra task to complete during the course of the game. Those who do the best are often awarded extra points. Past tasks have included drawing contests (in which [[John Sessions]] has shown a particular talent);<ref name="S2E10">{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (B series)|Series B, Episode 10]] | series = QI | airdate = 2004-12-10 | season = B | number = 10 }}</ref> or looking for a specific hidden thing over the course of the show, such as a [[squirrel]] or a [[cuttlefish]].<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (C series)|Series C, Episode 11]] | series = QI | airdate = 2005-12-09 | season = C | number = 11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (C series)|Series C, Episode 9]] | series = QI | airdate = 2005-11-25 | season = C | number = 9 }}</ref> Panellists were also once given a card covered with magnetic letters with which to create words over the course of one show. [[Jimmy Carr]] successfully used all of his letters to create, "Put Smarties tubes on cats legs, make them walk like a robot."<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (B series)|Series 2, Episode 5]] | series = QI | airdate = 2004-10-05 | season = B | number = 5 }}</ref> In the fifth series, all the episodes have the same extra task - "The Elephant in the Room". In each episode, one of the answers is related to [[elephant]]s, the panellists being required to wave an elephant on a stick when they believe it is the appropriate moment.  It was in the [[Children in Need]] special in which [[Pudsey Bear|Pudsey]] used his elephant on a stick to alert Fry to an audience member in an elephant mask which was, predictably, Alan Davies.

==Production==
[[Image:QI Davies.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Alan Davies on ''QI''.]]
Writer and former [[BBC]] producer [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] devised the format of the show, and it is produced by Quite Interesting Ltd., an organisation set up by Lloyd. ''QI'' was originally seen as being an "Annotated [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]… the world's first non-boring encyclopædia."<ref name="Factoid"/> As a panel game, it was conceived as a radio show, with Lloyd as chairman. When it was decided that the show would air on television, [[Michael Palin]] was offered the job of chairman with Fry and Davies as captains of "clever" and "stupid" teams, respectively. However, when Palin decided not to take the job, Fry stepped in, making Davies the only regular panellist, thus changing the entire format of the show.<ref>[http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2006/12/21/4850/last_among_eqials Chortle.co.uk "Last among eQIals"] Written [[21 December]], [[2006]]. Accessed [[21 June]], [[2007]].</ref>

The research for the show is mostly carried out by the [[Cultural impact of QI#The QI Elves|QI Elves]]. The elves devise the questions, and are able to contact Stephen during the show to provide and correct information.<ref name="Elves">[http://www.qi.com/about/people.php#elves ''QI''.com] The ''QI'' Elves, accessed [[17 January]] [[2007]]</ref> Other people involved in researching questions and compiling the scripts are [[John Mitchinson]], Piers Fletcher and [[Justin Pollard]] known as the ''Question Wranglers''.<ref name="Elves"/> Their research uses both Encyclopædia Britannica and [[Wikipedia]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Whittell|first=Giles|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article2765200.ece|title=Thinking buddies|publisher=The Times|date=2007-11-03|accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref>

The theme tune was composed by [[Howard Goodall]], who has twice appeared as a panellist on the show. The theme music was originally going to be the song [[Wonderful World (song)|Wonderful World]], sung by [[Herman's Hermits]], which was used in the unbroadcast pilot. However, they were forbidden the use of the song, and the DVD recording of the pilot now uses the theme music composed by Goodall.<ref name="Factoid"/>

The makers of the show insist that the questions are not given to the panellists beforehand so that they can rehearse them.<ref>[http://www.qi.com/tv/ ''QI''.com] ''QI'': The BBC Television Series. Accessed [[27 July]], [[2007]].</ref> The panel are given a list of questions set to be asked just about an hour before the show, and before recording starts, they run through a series of "warm up" questions; this is the only assistance the panellists receive. They are forbidden to ask for preparatory materials or other help.<ref name="Factoid"/> It is known that Davies never does any preparation at all.<ref name="Factoid"/> The show uses a warm-up comedian before recording begins, credited as the ''Audience Wrangler''. In the forthcoming series, [[Stephen Grant (comedian)|Stephen Grant]] provided the warm-up for ten of the twelve episodes, and [[Gordon Southern]] did so for the other two.<ref>[http://www.stephengrant.com/sg_television.htm#warmup Stephen Grant.com, Warm Up] Accessed [[23 June]], [[2007]].</ref>

==Episodes==
{{seealso|List of QI episodes}}

In ''QI'', every series is themed around a different letter of the alphabet, starting with the letter "A". Series are therefore referred to by letter rather than number. The first series started on [[11 September]], [[2003]], and consisted of topics beginning with A, including a round on people called "Alan". <ref name="SAE10"/> The second series consisted of topics beginning with "B", except in two episodes, one about "Music" and one about "Colour".<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (B series)|Music]] | series = QI | airdate = 2004-12-17 | season = B | number = 11}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (B series)|Colour]] | series = QI | airdate = 2004-10-08 | season = B | number = 1}}</ref> Series D differed from the previous three as all episodes focused upon a single "D" topic.  Series E also deals with single topics. A [[video podcast]] was also planned, but this was instead turned into a set of "Quickies" featured on the BBC homepage for ''QI'', although are still referred to as "vodcasts" by the panellists introducing them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/qi/|title=Comedy - QI|publisher=BBC|language=English|accessdate=2007-09-22}}</ref> Two episodes have the distinction of being won by the audience - Death, a special Halloween episode in the D series and England in series 5.

==Corrections and mistakes==
Although most of the facts presented on the show are correct, there has been the occasional slip-up. Several facts given are often updated and corrected in later series. For example, in Series A, the show claimed that the longest animal in the world was the [[lion's mane jellyfish]],<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (A series)|Series A, Episode 3]] | series = QI | airdate = 2003-09-25 | season = A | number = 3 }}</ref> but this was later corrected in Series C, saying that the longest animal on the world is the [[Lineus longissimus|bootlace worm]].<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (C series)|Series C, Episode 10]] | series = QI | airdate = 2005-12-02 | season = C | number = 10 }}</ref>

Members of the public and members of the ''QI'' website contact the show to correct information. In one case, a letter was read out when one episode in Series B claimed that language spoken by children's TV characters [[Flower Pot Men|Bill and Ben]] was called, "Flobbadob" and was named after the sound made by creator [[Hilda Brabban|Hilda Brabban's]] younger brothers farting in the bath.<ref name="S2E10"/> However, in Series D, Fry read out a letter written by [[Silas Hawkins]], the son of [[Peter Hawkins]], who provided the original voices of the characters. The letter read:

<blockquote>"The fart-in-the-bath story was trotted out last year in an episode of Stephen Fry's otherwise admirable quiz show ''QI''. It (the story) first appeared some twenty years ago in a newspaper article, to which my father immediately wrote a rebuttal. It was obviously ferreted out by some BBC researcher for ''QI''. It may be quite interesting, but in this case, it simply isn't true."<ref name="SDE8">{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (D series)|Descendants]] | series = QI | airdate = 2006-11-10 | season = D | number = 8 }}</ref></blockquote>

Fry then apologised and corrected the fact, saying, "Their language is called 'Oddle poddle'. 'Flobbadob' means 'Flowerpot' in Oddle poddle. I cannot believe I just said that", at which point he started laughing in disbelief.<ref name="SDE8"/>

At the end of the third series, [[Dara Ó Briain]] was deducted points for having stated, in the series before, that the [[triple point]] of water is zero degrees [[Celsius]], an answer which earned him 2 points at the time.<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (B series)|Series B, Episode 7]] | series = QI | airdate = 2004-11-19 | season = B | number = 7 }}</ref> Viewers however, wrote in to say that the triple point of water is in fact ''0.01'' degrees, and so the 2 points awarded Dara in the previous series were revoked and he received a further deduction of 10 points for saying a now ''obvious answer''. Dara humorously retorted with, "How many people sat at home watching that and said, 'It's just a comedy show, but I'm not letting that [[feck]]er get away with that!?'"<ref>{{cite episode | title = [[List of QI episodes (C series)|Series C, Episode 12]] | series = QI | airdate = 2005-12-16 | season = C | number = 12}}</ref>

==Culture==
{{main|Cultural impact of QI}}
''QI'' has released DVDs and books, most notably ''The Book of General Ignorance''. ''QI'' also has a building in [[Oxford]], where most of the show's research is carried out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qi.com/building/|title=The QI Building|accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref> The building consists of a café, a vodka bar and a bookshop. The bookshop is notable for arranging the books in whimsical, loosely-defined categories that mingle fiction and non-fiction, thus meaning people come across books at random, making it more interesting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qi.com/building/bookshop/|title=The QI Bookshop|accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref>

''QI'' has an internet show called ''[[QI News]]'', a parody news show which broadcasts "News" items about things which are quite interesting. ''QI News'' stars [[Glenn Wrage]] and [[Katherine Jakeways]] as the newsreaders, Bob Squire and Sophie Langton. It is broadcast on [[ComedyBox.tv]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedybox.tv/show-qi|title=QI News|publisher=ComedyBox.tv|language=English|accessdate=2007-09-21}}</ref> ''QI'' also has a website, and a column in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. ''QI'' has its own [[philosophy]]. It states that everything in the world, even that which appears to be most boring, is quite interesting if looked at in the right way. The website states that:

<blockquote>
"We live, they say, in The Information Age, yet almost none of the information we think we possess is true. [[Eskimo]]s do not rub noses. The [[rickshaw]] was invented by an American. [[Joan of Arc]] was not French. [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] was not Russian. The world is not solid, it is made of empty space and energy, and neither [[haggis]], [[whisky]], [[porridge]], [[tartan|clan tartans]] nor [[kilt]]s are [[Scotland|Scottish]]. So we stand, silent, on a peak in [[Darién Province|Darien]]: a vast, rolling, teeming, untrodden territory before us. ''QI'' country. Whatever is interesting we are interested in. Whatever is not interesting, we are even more interested in. Everything is interesting if looked at ''in the right way''. At one extreme, ''QI'' is serious, intensely scientific, deeply mystical; at the other it is hilarious, silly and frothy enough to please the most indolent couch-potato."<ref>[http://www.qi.com/about/philosophy.php ''QI''.com, Philosophy.] Accessed [[15 June]] [[2007]].</ref>
</blockquote>

== Reception ==
''QI'' has been generally supported by nearly all critics.  The main reason for this is that many critics are of the opinion that ''QI'' is not "dumbed down" like many other television shows.  [[Peter Chapman]] said, "When the schedules seem so dumbed-down, it's a delight to encounter the brainy and articulate Stephen Fry.  He excels in this format, being both scathing and generous."<ref>{{cite web | last = Chapman | first = Peter | title = ''QI'': Quite Interesting | publisher = ''QI'' News, originally ''[[The Independent]]'' | url = http://www.qi.com/news/item.php?id=119 | date = 2005-11-18 | accessdate = 2007-08-03}}</ref>

Another critic, [[Laura Barton]] said, "''QI'' and its canny coupling of Stephen Fry and Alan Davies, which manages to condense tweedy goodness, cockney charm, pub trivia and class war into one half-hour."<ref>{{cite web | last = Barton | first = Laura | title = ''QI'': The last bastion of good television | publisher = ''QI'' News, originally ''[[The Guardian]]'' | url = http://www.qi.com/news/item.php?id=97 | date = 2006-04-26 | accessdate = 2007-08-03}}</ref> An [[United States|American]] critic, [[Liesl Schillinger]] described ''QI'' as, "''[[Jeopardy]]'' with [[Stephen Colbert]] as host, with [[Steve Martin]] and [[Ellen DeGeneres]] as guests, working off a game board loaded with unanswerable questions."<ref>{{cite web|last=Schillinger|first=Liesl|url=http://www.qi.com/news/item.php?id=489|title=QI gets The New York Times treatment|publisher=''QI News'', orginally ''[[The New York Times]]''|date=2007-09-02|accessdate=2007-09-13}}</ref>

Critics have questioned the way the show is edited. One critic said, "At one point in tonight's show, Fry (normally urbanity itself) yells an obscenity at Rich Hall, the result of, I guess, a long interchange between the two but, as most of it appears to have been cut out, the outburst comes out of the blue, making Fry look as if he's flipped his lid."<ref>{{cite web | title = ''QI'' in full swing | publisher = ''QI'' News, originally ''[[Hull Daily Mail|The Hull Daily Mail]]'' | url = http://www.qi.com/news/item.php?id=149 | date = 2003-12-30 | accessdate = 2007-08-03}}</ref>
