'''''Chain Reaction''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[game show]], ''where one word leads to another''. There have been three incarnations of the series: [[Bill Cullen]] hosted the original series on [[NBC]] from [[January 14]], [[1980]] - [[June 20]], [[1980]]; [[Blake Emmons]], and later [[Geoff Edwards]] both hosted the second version on the [[USA Network|USA]] cable network from [[September 29]], [[1986]]- [[December 27]], [[1991]]; [[Dylan Lane]] hosts a new version currently airing on [[Game Show Network|GSN]]. The series was created by [[Bob Stewart (television)|Bob Stewart]]. The GSN version is from the producers of ''[[Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?]]''.

On [[August 1]], [[2006]], a new version of ''Chain Reaction'' debuted on [[Game Show Network|GSN]] hosted by [[Dylan Lane]]. It currently is airing at 10:00p.m. [[North American Eastern Time Zone|ET]] on Tuesdays through Saturdays, and reruns at 2:30p.m. on Saturday and Sunday afternoon. The show has been renewed for a second season, which will commence March 13, 2007.

==Overview==
At the crux of the game was a word chain. In the chain, each of eight words (seven starting in 1986) was connected to both the word above it and the word below it in some way. By making inferences based on the revealed words and the revealed letters in incomplete words, contestants tried to fill in the word chains to score points (dollars on GSN). The team or player that reached the point/money goal first would win the game and play the bonus round, which was completely different depending on the series.

==NBC==
The first version aired for 23 weeks, from [[January 14]] to [[June 20]], [[1980]] on NBC and was hosted by Bill Cullen. The announcer was announcer [[Johnny Gilbert]]. The theme song (which carried over to the USA version) was composed by [[Bob Cobert]] and was once used as background music for the NBC series [[Supertrain]]. Repeats of this version aired for several years on cable, first on the CBN Cable Network (now ABC Family Channel) from 1982 to 1984, then later on the USA Cable Network from 1985 to the debut of the new version that originated from Canada, and GSN from 1997-98.

===Main game===
Two teams of three competed in each game. A team consisted of one contestant and two celebrity guests. The teams were shown the beginning and ending words of an eight word chain. Each word somehow related to the word above it and below it. A sample chain could be:

CHAIN<br>
GANG<br>
FOUR<br>
SQUARE<br>
DANCE<br>
PARTY<br>
TIME<br>
FLIES<br>

The team with the challenger goes first to begin the game (in the event of two new players, a coin toss determined who went first).  The challengers were the blue team, and the champions were the gold team (sometimes it's the other way around).

As the game continued, the words would be revealed. A player's turn consisted of calling for a letter in the next word above or below one of the words, and then guessing the word (note that the last letter of each word is not revealed). A correct response won one point for each letter in the word (two if the word had a '+' mark next to it) and that team kept control of the board. If the player in control was incorrect, or gave no guess, control went back to the other team. The game continued until either one team scored 50 points, or the chain was finished. If that happened, another chain was put up and the game continued until one team reached the goal of 50 points (any letters exceeding 50 points are not included to the player's score). That team's contestant won the game, $250, and the right to play for $10,000 in the bonus round.  The losing player got $5 a point for playing.

Normally it would take two chains of words to complete a game, but three chains have been played a few times.

===Instant Reaction===
In the bonus round, the team had 90 seconds (originally 60) to get the contestant to guess a series of words or phrases. The catch was that the two celebrities had to construct a question for the clue word, and they could only contribute one word at a time. After the celebrities finished the question, they prompted the contestant to guess by hitting a plunger (which sounded like a high-pitched bell). A correct answer moved closer to the grand prize $10,000, an incorrect answer or a pass cancelled that word and they had to move on.  At any time a celebrity used more than one word, formed an unacceptable question or used part of the answer, a cuckoo sound would be signaled, cancelling that answer and moving on to the next one.

===Celebrity players===
Among the many celebrity players who appeared frequently on ''Chain Reaction'' included [[Nipsey Russell]], [[Joyce Bulifant]], [[Jay Johnson]], [[Anita Gillette]], [[Robert Mandan]] and [[Vicki Lawrence]].  Russell appeared the most, guesting in six weeks of episodes, followed by Robert Mandan, Jay Johnson and Anita Gillette, all appearing in five weeks.

==USA==
The USA network had "Chain Reaction" become their third original game show (''[[Love Me, Love Me Not (game)|Love Me, Love Me Not]]'' and a revival of ''[[Jackpot (game show)|Jackpot!]]'' were aired earlier) due to the popularity of reruns of the original Chain Reaction. [[Blake Emmons]], a former contestant on ''The Joker's Wild'' in 1985, hosted the show for a few weeks before being replaced by [[Geoff Edwards]]. Rod Charlebois was the co-host/announcer, who presented the "home game" for the viewing audience. Rod was a local radio and TV personality at [[CFCF]] Radio and Television in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada, where Chain Reaction was taped (it was a production of USA Network and [[CFCF]]'s wholly owned Champlain Productions division). He was given an on-air role because all Canadian television programs must employ a percentage of Canadians both on and off air in order to qualify as both Canadian content, and to receive government funding (where applicable, Chain Reaction did not apply).  Edwards had no ties to Canada and was not Canadian, thus Charlebois was given the co-hosting duties.

This version used a recorded audience track (a commonplace for many game shows during the 1970s and 1980s) instead of a live studio audience.  According to Edwards, most of the production staff spoke French for the most part, but a few did speak English.

===Main Game===
The chains now had seven words. The teams were now two civilian players each, and each was given one responsibility.  One teammate was the letter giver, and decided whether to give a letter to his/her partner or to other team's word guesser.  As before, a correct response was worth points and control of the board.  In Round One, each word guessed is worth 10 points, but the final word guessed in that chain is worth 20 (changed to 15 in season two). In Round Two, these values escalate to 20 points each & 40 points for the final word. In the event that a fourth chain was needed to decide the game, the point values were 40 points per word and 80 for the final word.

The first team to score 200 points won the game. That team played the bonus game, and returned on the next show.

During the run, two methods of earning bonus money were used. In the first season, the middle word of the second chain was also a bonus word (designated by a dollar sign) worth $250 for the team that guessed it. For seasons two to four, the players played a Missing Link. The team in the lead would be shown the first and last words of a three-word chain. If they could guess the word in between with no letters revealed, the team received $500. Every wrong guess added a letter while taking away $100 from the potential payoff.

For seasons three and four, only solo players participated, and it took 300 points to win.

===Bonus Chain===
The winning team/player could collect a cash jackpot by completing one last word chain. The team/player was shown the first word in a chain, and the initial letter of the other words. One at a time, the player(s) would guess at the next word in the chain. For each wrong guess, the next letter would be filled in, and a letter deducted from their account. If the team could finish the chain before running out of letters the team won the cash jackpot. If not, they (or he/she) won $100 per word, including the one at the top. The jackpot began at $3000 ($2000 with the solo players); and $1000 was added each day it was not claimed. The highest pot was $14,000. While Emmons was host, the account was nine letters, when Geoff Edwards took over, it was lowered to seven.

The bonus chain was removed in season five, because the end of season four had an elimination tournament of champions, where the 16 top winners of seasons three and four returned in an NCAA-Basketball like tourney (one loss and the player was eliminated). 16 players reduced to 8, down to 4, and then down to 2. The final winner of the final game won $20K. Games were all played to 500 points.

===The $40,000 Chain Reaction===
On [[New Year's Eve]] [[1990]], the show was revamped with a tournament format, featuring one hundred twenty-eight players competing for $40,000. The game was just like before, but there was no bonus chain, and two new players competed each show. The values for each chain remained the same, but if a fifth chain was needed, the point values were 50 points per word and 100 for the final word.

Eight players played for the first four shows. After four days, those four winners played two each for the next two days. Those two winners played on the 7th day and the winner of that game won $7500. 

The player who led after the second chain got to play a Missing Link for $300. The Missing Link changed then too: First letter of middle word given. Word worth $300, each additional letter reduced the bonus by $100.

After 16 $7500 tournaments were played, those 16 players played in a single-elimination tournament. The semi-finals was double-elimination, and the two players remaining played one game for $40,000.

===Home game===
Each day, before closing the show, Rod would present the answer to yesterday's home game, and the current game. The home game consisted of a Missing Link.  Sometimes Rod would reveal the first letter of the missing link, sometimes he wouldn't.

All cash values for the USA Network version are in Canadian dollars.

==GSN==
A new version of the show debuted on [[August 1]], [[2006]], on GSN. This version is hosted by [[Dylan Lane]], and produced by [[Michael Davies (television producer)|Michael Davies]]' production company Embassy Row. It is being taped in [[New York City]]. GSN has ordered the game show for a second season.

===Opening===
The opening theme then plays and essentially explains the rules of the game, while on screen the viewer can see it explained visually:

''"It starts with "word",''
''there's a "G" underneath.''
''Guess the word "game" and you're right;'' 
''the word "game" starts a chain.''
''Get your letter, take a guess,''
''connect the chain, win some cash.''
''It's guys against girls right now on ''Chain Reaction''."''

===Main game===
There are four chains in the main game of seven words. Gameplay is similar to the NBC version, except that the words in the chain are now always two-word phrases or compound words, and if a contestant calls for a letter that completes the word, it is revealed; though the fact that it is the final letter is not announced, and sometimes isn't necessarily evident. If the final letter is revealed and the word is not correctly guessed, neither team gets the money.

Example of chain:<BR>
STUNT<BR>
DOUBLE<BR>
DOWN<BR>
TIME<BR>
LINE<BR>
UP<BR>
HILL<BR>

In round one each correct word is worth $100, round two words are worth $200, and words in round three are worth $300. Whichever team is behind going into a round starts the next round (in the event of a tie, the team who didn't start the last chain starts the next chain). In the fourth round, teams can wager between $100 and $500 of their bank before being given their letter. If correct, they win their bet, and keep control, if not, they lose the money and control. A team automatically loses if they go broke, and the game ends prematurely.

Each team consists of three people of the same gender; the style is "battle of the sexes".

====Speed chain====
After each of the first three rounds, whichever team correctly identified the final word to complete the chain gets the opportunity at a speed chain. They have to complete a four word with the first letter of the middle two words given. An example could be:

HALF<Br>
B_______ (BAKED)<br>
A_______ (ALASKA)<br>
PIPELINE

The team has seven seconds to conference and come up with the two words. If correct, they win the same value as a single correct word in the previous round ($100-$300).

===Tiebreaker===
After four rounds, only the team with most money moves onto the bonus round.  However, if the fourth round ends in a tie, the teams will be given alternating Speed Chains in a Sudden Death format. If one team does not solve their Speed Chain, the other team need only solve their next Speed Chain to win the game.

===Bonus round===
The team with the most money after the fourth round plays the [[bonus round]]. The bonus round gives the winning team a chance to double or triple the money earned in the main game. The rules are similar to the original "Instant Reaction", except the third team member (the one giving the answers) is blindfolded. The first two members must give clues by building questions, alternating one word at a time. If either cluegiver gives more than one word in a row, build a clue that isn't loosely in the form of a question, or say part of the answer, a cuckoo sounds and they must move on to the next word. The blindfolded player cannot answer until one of the three team members hits a small bell which all three have their hands over. Once the bell is hit, no more clues may be given on that word. Any team member can also say "pass" as often as they want to throw out the current word.

The team is given 90 seconds to go through as many as 20 words. If they can get five correct, they double their money; if they can get seven correct, they triple it.  In the first thirty episodes, however, the requirements were seven to double and ''ten'' to triple; this format proved to be excessively difficult (several teams managed to double under the old rules, but nobody managed to triple, although two or three teams came very close).

In the event that the host makes a mistake in moving to the next player, the chain is thrown out, with the scores standing as they were before the mistake was made, and a new chain begins.

The most money a team can theoretically win in a game is $17,700.
