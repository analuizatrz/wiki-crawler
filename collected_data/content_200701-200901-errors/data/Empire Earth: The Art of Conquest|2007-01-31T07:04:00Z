'''''Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest''''', also known as '''EE: AoC''' or '''AoC''' for short, is the official expansion pack for [[GameSpy]]'s 2001 Game of the Year: '''''[[Empire Earth (video game)|Empire Earth]]''''', one of the [[real-time strategy]] games made by ''[[Age of Empires]]'' lead designer, [[Rick Goodman]]. The game expansion pack was released in [[September 17]],[[2002]].
The Gold Edition of '''''Empire Earth''''', which features both the original and the expansion, was released on [[May 6]],[[2003]].

==Overview==
Unlike Empire Earth, ''Art of Conquest'' was not developed by [[Stainless Steel Studios]], but by [[Mad Doc Software]]. This was because the team at Stainless Steel Studios instead devoted their time and resources to creating what was then Rick Goodman's latest game: ''[[Empires: Dawn of the Modern World]]'', the spiritual successor to Empire Earth. 

The gameplay is the same as the original ''Empire Earth'', but with changes discussed below.

The most notable of the changes was the new Multiplayer server which meant that it was now possible to play the game online with up to 7 other players. There is now rarely over 100 players online at peak times.

==Features==
* Three new single-player campaigns 
* Two new hero units to aid in battle.
* Two new civilizations: [[Japan]] and [[Korea]].
* All civilizations get new unique civilization powers.
* More buildings.
* Additional units.
* Difficulty settings for scenarios (this was given to the original Empire Earth game with the version 2.0 update).
* Orbital [[Space station]] [[Seven Wonders of the World|wonder of the world]] with the ''Inspiration'' power which boosts morale to all of the owner's spaceships
* Play the game multiplayer with up to 8 other players from around the globe. 
* Lobby system and Direct ip/ LAN connect avaible

==New Epoch: Space Age==
[[Image:Pc_empire-earth_zeitalter-ss1-1-.jpg|right|thumb|240px|A game taking place on an alien planet.]]
The '''Space Age''' (Epoch XV) allows the building of spaceports and [[spaceships]] on maps that allow it. Human soldiers and citizens are now replaced by robots. Farms are now run by robots as well and no longer need citizens to manage them. The Japanese civilization can create Cyber Ninjas, a special cloaked unit which can temporarily disable buildings.  Walls change from polarised titanium to force fields, and towers become more sophisticated.

==Civilizations and Powers==
In ''The Art of Conquest'', each civilization has its own power, or "civ power". Often, these powers are only available during certain epochs. A civ power gives each nation a specialty. For example, the French have the power of camouflage, which allows them to hide their military units from the enemy temporarily. Each civilization also possesses a unique unit or building. These civilizations were all real, with the exception of the futuristic Novaya Russia and the Rebel Forces.

==Campaigns==
Three new campaigns were added in The Art of Conquest: a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] campaign about [[Marius]] and [[Julius Caesar]], a Pacific one involving the warfare in the [[Pacific Ocean]] during [[World War II]], and a futuristic [[Asia]]n campaign involving the colonization of Mars.

====Roman campaign====
The Roman campaign revolves around the struggles of [[Marius]] as well as the conquests of [[Julius Caesar]]. 

The campaign begins with a war with the local tribes of Italy and barbarian invaders, in which the player can conscript citizens. The next scenario is Marius's war with [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]], which the player must liberate [[Rome]] to win. 

The last four scenarios are about Julius Caesar's years as a general. The first scenario is about Caesar's war in the east against Sulla. The second scenario is very long and details the conquest of [[Gaul]] and the invasion of [[Britain]]. The third scenario is Caesar's war with his former ally and friend [[Pompey]], which starts with the famous crossing the [[Rubicon]] and ends at the battle of [[Farsala]]. The final scenario is the conquest of [[Egypt]].

====Pacific campaign====
This campaign focuses on American battles in the [[Pacific Ocean]] during World War II.

The campaign starts with the [[Battle of Midway]] and completes with the sinking of Japanese aircraft carriers [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']], [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sōryū|''Sōryū'']], [[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|''Kaga'']] and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryū|''Hiryū'']]. The next scenario is the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]] in 1943. It is followed by scenarios detailing the island-hopping campaign derived by [[Douglas MacArthur]] which include killing Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], a special mission in [[Burma]] and the [[Battle for Leyte Gulf]], and the reconquest of [[Leyte]]. The campaign is concluded with [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], completed by sending five marines to the southern tip of the Island ([[Iwo Jima|Mount Suribachi]]). (''See [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]].'')

====Asian campaign====
This campaign consists of two parts, the story being told from the perspective of the [[Kwan Do]] family, who claim to be descendants of the [[Qin Dynasty]].

Part One details the colonization of [[Mars]]. As soon as it is discovered that it is possible to colonize Mars, the major superpowers of Earth scramble to develop the technologies and resources needed to establish settlements on Mars. One of these powers is the newly-formed [[United Federation of Asian Republics]] (UFAR), essentially founded and controlled by the Kwan Do family, the rich owner of Kwan Do Electronics and Commnications called Hu Kwan Do. The UFAR government struggles to repress local rebellions and terrorism by those who claim that earth is the only home to mankind. Meanwhile, the UFAR also struggles to develop a colonial programme competing against rival superpowers. UFAR eventually establishes a colony on Mars, with help from Japan, along with settlements built by the US/[[Canada|Canadian]] Conglomerate, the [[European Union]] of Nations, [[Novaya Russia]], and the [[Republic of Japan]], partitioning Mars into five regions. 

Part Two is set 250 years after the first part during the Space Epoch. The Kwan Do dynasty had been overthrown from power. Harsh conditions on Mars and an increasingly negative perception of the [[Earth]] governments have finally forced the Martian colonists into rebellion. During the revolutions, a descendant of the Kwan Do family, called Khan Sun Do, unites the five territories, and with the acquisition of [[Space Battleship Yamato]], the Martians fight Earth for their independence in an inter-planetary war. The campaign ends with the last battle for Martian independence and the installation of Khan Sun Do as the first leader of Mars.
== Multiplayer Games==
Empire Earth supports multiplayer games over LAN connections and online. Multiplayer games are identical in form to single player games. Online games are not very common anymore, with up to 100 people online in the lobby with another 200 in games at peak hours.

==Initial reactions==
The reactions to ''The Art of Conquest ''was relatively mixed. [[IGN]] gave the expansion pack a 7.9/10 while [[GameSpot]] gave a 5.2/10. The new civilization powers were a welcome feature which diversified the game. The additional maps and scenarios were also praised. Space was considered by some to be poorly implemented, as spaceships were only available on certain maps and it used the same sort of gameplay as water (i.e. a dock-type building is built and spaceships travel much like naval ships). The graphics were not improved in this expansion pack, which some reviewers considered a detriment. The initial price was considered steep given the features that were added, but as the expansion became discounted, this was less of an issue.

==Empire Earth II==
In April 2005, Mad Doc released the long awaited sequel to Empire Earth, ''[[Empire Earth II]]'', with largely renovated features.
