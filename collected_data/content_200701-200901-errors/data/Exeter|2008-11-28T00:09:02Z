'''Exeter''' ({{Audio|en-uk-Exeter.ogg|pronunciation}} (IPA ˈeksɪtər) is a [[city status in the United Kingdom|city]], [[Urban district|district]] and [[county town]] of [[Devon]], [[England]]. Exeter is located approximately {{convert|37|mi|km}} northeast of [[Plymouth]], and {{convert|70|mi|km}} southwest of [[Bristol]], on the [[River Exe]]. The city has a population of 111,076 according to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]]. 

Exeter was the most south-westerly Roman fortified settlement in [[Roman Britain|Britain]] and has existed since ''[[time immemorial]]''. [[Exeter Cathedral]], founded in 1050 is [[Anglicanism|Anglican]].

Tourism forms a vital part of the city's economy, and in 2004 Exeter was granted [[Fairtrade]] City status. Exeter has been identified as one of the top ten most profitable locations for a business to be based, and has a sizable service economy, with a catchment workforce of 300,000 people within a 45 minute commute.<ref>Dun & Bradstreet, 2001</ref> The city has good transport links, with [[Exeter Central railway station]], [[Exeter St David's railway station]], the [[M5 motorway]] and [[Exeter International Airport]] connecting the city both nationally and internationally.
==History==
===Roman times===
{{main|Isca Dumnoniorum}}

[[Image:Exeter, 1563.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration of Exeter in 1563, entitled ''Civitas Exoniae (vulgo Excester) urbs primaria in comitatu Devoniae'']]
[[Image:Exeter St Davids 1844.jpg|thumb|right|Exeter in 1844. A print by William Spreat showing St David's shortly after its consecration in 1844]].
The [[Latin]] name for Exeter, ''Isca Dumnoniorum '' ("Isca of the [[Dumnones]]"), suggests that the city was of [[Celt]]ic origin. This [[oppidum]], (a [[Latin]] term meaning an important town), on the banks of the [[River Exe]] certainly existed prior to the foundation of the [[Roman Britain|Roman city]] in about AD 50, however the name may have been suggested by a Celtic adviser to the Romans, rather than by the original inhabitants of the place.

Such early towns, or proto-cities, had been a feature of pre-Roman [[Gaul]] as described by [[Julius Caesar]] in his ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' ("Commentaries on the Gallic Wars") and it is possible that they existed in neighbouring [[Great Britain]] as well. Isca is clearly a [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] generic noun and the Romans felt the need to name the city Isca Dumnoniorum in order to distinguish it from such settlements as [[Isca Augusta]] (modern [[Caerleon]]-on-Usk in [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]]). 

Significant parts of the Roman wall remain, though the present visible structure was largely built on the orders of [[Alfred the Great]] to protect the far west of his kingdom following the [[Viking]] occupation of 876. Most of its route can be traced on foot. There is a substantial [[Roman baths]] complex that was excavated in the 1970s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba65/feat2.shtml|title=Great Sites: Exeter Roman Baths|work=British Archaeology magazine|date=June 2002|accessdate=2008-07-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exeter.gov.uk/timetrail/02_romanfortress/bath_house.htm |title=The Roman Fortress at Exeter: The Roman Bath House|accessdate=2008-07-12}}</ref> but because of its proximity to the cathedral, it has not been practicable to retain the excavation for public view. Exeter was also the southern starting point for the [[Fosse Way]] [[Roman road]].

===Saxon times===
In 876 Exeter (Exanceaster) was attacked and captured by the [[Danes (ancient people)|Dane]]s. [[King Alfred]] ([[Alfred the Great]]) drove them out the next year. In 894 the city held off another siege by the Danes. However, the city fell to the Danes a second time in 1001. In 927 Athelstan drove the south west Celts out of the walled city of Exeter.

In 1067 the city rebelled against [[William the Conqueror]] who promptly marched west and laid siege. The city submitted after only 18 days. Part of the capitulation agreement was that all the nobles in the city would be confirmed in their positions as long as a castle was built.

===Medieval times===
Exeter was held against [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] by [[Baldwin de Redvers]] in 1140 and submitted only after a three month siege when the supplies of fresh water ran out.

===Tudor and Stuart times===
[[Image:ExeterWestGatePlaque.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque on St Mary Steps Church commemorating the old West Gate and some of the military campaigns in which it featured]]
In 1537, the city was made a [[county corporate]]. In 1549 the city successfully withstood a month-long siege by the [[Prayer Book Rebellion|Prayer Book rebels]]. The Livery Dole [[Almshouse]]s and [[Chapel]] at [[Heavitree]] were founded in March 1591 and finished in 1594. They can still be seen today in the street which bears the name ''Livery Dole''.

The city's motto, ''[[Semper fidelis]]'', is traditionally held to have been suggested by [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], in acknowledgement of the city's contribution of ships to help defeat the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exeter.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=3469|work= Exeter City Council website|title= Exeter's Coat of Arms|accessdate=2008-07-13}}</ref>

Exeter was at first a [[Parliamentary]] town in the [[English Civil War]] in the largely Royalist South West, but it was captured by the [[Cavalier|Royalists]] on [[4 September]] [[1643]] and it remained in their control until near the end of the war, being one of the final Royalist cities to fall into Parliamentary hands. During this period, Exeter was an economically powerful city, with a strong trade of [[wool]]. This was partly due to the surrounding area which was "more fertile and better inhabited than that passed over the preceding day" according to Count [[Lorenzo Magalotti]] who visited the city when he was 26 years old.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Todd|title=Exeter: The Traveller's Tales|date=2000|ISBN=1903356008|pages=16}}</ref> Magalotti writes of over thirty thousand people being employed in the county of Devon as part of the wool and cloth industries, merchandise that was sold to "the West Indies, Spain, France and Italy".<ref>{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Todd|title=Exeter: The Traveller's Tales|date=2000|ISBN=1903356008|pages=18}}</ref> Celia Fiennes also visited Exeter during this period, in the early 1700s. She remarked on the "vast trade" and "incredible quantity" in Exeter, recording that "it turns the most money in a week of anything in England", between £10,000—£15,000.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Todd|title=Exeter: The Traveller's Tales|date=2000|ISBN=1903356008|pages=31}}</ref>

===Georgian and Victorian times===
[[Image:High Street, Exeter, England, ca. 1895.jpg|thumb|right|The High Street ca. 1895]]
Early in the [[Industrial Revolution]], Exeter's industry developed on the basis of locally available agricultural products and, since the city's location on a fast-flowing river gave it ready access to [[water power]], an early industrial site developed on drained marshland to the west of the city, at [[Exe Island]]. However when [[steam power]] replaced water in the 19th century, Exeter was too far from sources of coal (or iron) to develop further. As a result the city declined in relative importance, and was spared the rapid 19th century development that changed many historic European cities. Extensive canal redevelopments during this period further expanded Exeter's economy, with "vessels of 15 to 16 tons burthen [bringing] up goods and merchandise from [[Topsham, Devon|Topsham]] to the City Quay".<ref>{{cite book|last=Oliver|first=George|title=History of the City of Exeter|date=1861|pages=107}}</ref>

The first railway to arrive in Exeter was the [[Bristol and Exeter Railway]] that opened a station at [[Exeter St Davids railway station|St Davids]] on the western edge in 1844. The [[South Devon Railway Company]] extended the line westwards to [[Plymouth]], opening their own smaller station at [[Exeter St Thomas railway station|St Thomas]], near the lower end of Fore Street. A more central railway station, that at [[Exeter Central railway station|Queen Street]], was opened by the [[London and South Western Railway]] in 1860 when it opened its alternative route to [[London]].

===Wartime and post-war times===
[[Image:Parliament Street, Exeter.jpg|right|thumb|Two people cannot easily pass in [[Parliament Street, Exeter|Parliament Street]], one of the narrowest streets in the United Kingdom.]]
Exeter was bombed by the [[Germany|German]] [[Luftwaffe]] in the [[World War II|Second World War]], when a total of 18 raids between 1940 and 1942 flattened much of the city centre. In 1942, as part of the [[Baedeker Blitz]] and specifically in response to the [[RAF]] bombing of [[Lubeck]], forty [[acre]]s (160,000 m²) of the city, particularly adjacent to its central High Street and Sidwell Street, were levelled by [[incendiary weapon|incendiary bombing]]. Many historic buildings were destroyed, and others, including the grand [[Exeter Cathedral|Cathedral of St Peter]] in the heart of the city, were damaged. 

Large areas of the city were rebuilt in the 1950s, when little attempt was made to preserve Exeter's ancient heritage. Damaged buildings were generally demolished rather than restored, and even the street plan was altered in an attempt to improve traffic circulation. The post-war buildings are generally perceived as being of little architectural merit, unlike many of those that they replaced, such as Bedford Circus and a section of the ancient city wall. 

Despite some local opposition,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2817257.stm|title = High Street revamp plans criticised|accessdate = 2007-09-21|publisher = BBC News}}</ref> the [[Princesshay]] shopping centre has been redeveloped between the Cathedral Close and the High Street. The development was completed and opened on time on [[20 September]] [[2007]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/09/19/princesshay_opening_day_feature.shtml|title = Doors open at Princesshay|accessdate = 2007-09-21|date =  2007-09-20|publisher = BBC Devon}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title = Heaven for shoppers as Princesshay gets off to a flying start with huge crowds for opening day|| url = http://www.thisisexeter.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=142326&command=displayContent&sourceNode=142321&contentPK=18452155&folderPk=79876&pNodeId=142331| publisher = Express & Echo| date =  2007-09-21| accessdate = 2007-09-21}}</ref>  There are 123 varied residential units incorporated into the new Princesshay<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.princesshay.com/community/Keyfacts/index.aspx|title = Key facts about Princesshay|accessdate = 2007-09-21|work = Princesshay.com|publisher = Land Securities Group}}</ref> .

In order to enable people with limited mobility to enjoy the city, Exeter Community Transport Association provides shopmobility<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exetercta.co.uk/shopmobility.html|title=Shopmobility|work=Exeter Community Transport Association|accessdate=2008-07-13}}</ref> for use by anyone suffering from short or long-term mobility impairment to access to the city centre and shopping facilities, events and meetings with friends and company.

Previously regarded as second only to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] as an architectural site in southern England, since the 1942 bombing and subsequent reconstruction Exeter has been a city with some beautiful buildings rather than a beautiful city. As a result, although there is a significant [[tourist]] trade, Exeter is not dominated by tourism. In May 2008 there was an [[22 May 2008 Exeter bombing|attempted terrorist attack]] in [[Princesshay]].

==Governance==
Exeter forms a single [[Exeter (UK Parliament constituency)|parliamentary constituency]]. It is relatively marginal, and since [[World War II]] its [[Member of Parliament]] has usually been drawn from the governing party. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997]], [[Ben Bradshaw]] was elected as MP for Exeter, and he retained the seat at the elections of [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005]]. Exeter is part of the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England]] European constituency, which elects 7 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s.

Exeter's [[city council]] is a [[Non-metropolitan district|district]] authority, and shares responsibility for [[local government]] with the [[Devon County Council]]. Since 2003, no party has had a majority on the council.

Exeter has had a [[mayor]] since at least 1207 and until 2002, the city was the oldest 'Right Worshipful' Mayoralty in England. As part of the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]]'s 2002 [[Golden Jubilee]] celebrations Exeter was chosen to receive the title of [[Lord Mayor]]. Councillor Granville Baldwin became the first Lord Mayor of Exeter on [[1 May]] [[2002]] when [[Letters Patent]] were awarded to the city during a visit by the Queen.

The Lord Mayor is elected each year from amongst the 40 Exeter city [[councillor]]s and is non-political for the term of office. 

[[Devon and Cornwall Constabulary]] have their headquarters based at Middlemoor in the east of the city.

==Geography== 
The city of Exeter was established on the eastern bank of the [[River Exe]] on a ridge of land backed by a steep hill. It is at this point that the Exe, having just been joined by the [[River Creedy]], opens onto a wide [[flood plain]] and estuary which results in quite common flooding. Historically this was the lowest bridging point of the River Exe which was tidal and navigable up to the city until the construction of weirs later in its history. This combined with the easily defensible higher ground of the ridge made the current location of the city a natural choice for settlement and trade. In George Oliver's ''The History of the City of Exeter'', it is noted that the most likely reasons for the original settling of what would become modern Exeter was the "fertility of the surrounding countryside" and the area's "beautiful and commanding elevation [and] its rapid and navigable river".<ref>{{cite book|last=Oliver|first=George|title=History of the City of Exeter|date=1861|pages=1}}</ref>
Its woodland would also have been ideal for natural resources and hunting.

Exeter sits predominantly on sandstone and conglomerate geology, although the structure of the surrounding areas is varied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/erdp/docs/swchapter/section11/topography.htm|title=Southwest EDRP Geographical Area and Physical Context|last=DEFRA|accessdate=2008-07-13}}</ref>  
The topography of the ridge which forms the backbone of the city includes a [[volcanic plug]], on which the [[Rougemont Castle]] is situated. The Cathedral is located on the edge of this ridge and is therefore visible for a considerable distance.

==Demographics==
The city has been expanding in size quite considerably in recent years, with a population estimate of 119,600 in 2006, up over 8,000 from the census in 2001. The racial makeup of the city is as follows (2005 Estimates):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&b=276927&c=Exeter&d=13&e=13&g=436252&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1195991790357&enc=1&dsFamilyId=1812|title=
Resident Population Estimates by Ethnic Group (Percentages), Area: Exeter (Local Authority)|publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]]|accessdate=2008-07-13}}</ref>
* [[White]] - 97.5%
* [[British Asian|Asian]] - 1.4% (0.7% Indian, 0.4% Other, 0.2% Pakistani, 0.2% Bangladeshi)
* [[British Mixed|Mixed Race]] - 1.1% (0.4% Asian and White, 0.3% Black and White, 0.3% Other Mixed)
* [[British Chinese|Chinese]] - 0.6%
* [[Black British|Black]] - 0.4% (0.2% African,0.1% Caribbean,0.1% Other)
* [[Other ethnic group (United Kingdom Census)|Other]] - 0.5%
In the 2004-05 period the population of "[[White Other (United Kingdom Census)#Demographics|White Other]]" increased by 24% from 2.9% to 3.6%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTrendView.do?a=7&b=276927&c=Exeter&d=13&e=13&f=21833&g=436252&i=1001x1003x1004x1005&l=1812&o=198&m=0&r=1&s=1216456327983&enc=1&adminCompId=21833&variableFamilyIds=6365&xW=1128|title=Exeter, Resident Population Estimates by Ethnic Group||publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]]|accessdate=2008-07-19}}</ref>  - higher than any other town or city in the United Kingdom{{Fact|date=July 2008}}.

==Economy==
The city provides strong industries and services to a sizable area. The [[Met Office]], the main [[weather]] forecasting organisation for the [[United Kingdom]] and one of the most significant in the world, relocated from [[Bracknell]] in Berkshire to Exeter in early 2004. It is one of the three largest employers in the area (the others being the [[University of Exeter]] and Devon [[County Council]]), providing a welcome boost to the local [[economics|economy]].

[[Exeter City Council]] is currently bidding for the city to become an [[unitary authority|Independent Unitary Authority]], a status granted to nearby Plymouth and [[Torbay]] in 1998. An outline case was submitted to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government in May 2006. If successful, a new unitary city council could be up and running in Exeter by April 2009.

On [[26 June]] [[2004]], Exeter was granted [[Fairtrade City]] status. 

A [[New Economics Foundation|NEF]] survey in 2005 rated Exeter as the worst example of a [[clone town]] in the UK, with only a single independent store in the city's High Street, and less diversity (in terms of different categories of shop) than any other town surveyed. However, Exeter has many independent shops off High Street such as those in Gandy Street, which was reconstructed after bombing in 1942. 

[[Princesshay]], a [[post-war]] retail area running parallel to High Street was also home to a number of independent stores prior to redevelopment in 2007. It is an innovative varied development and it is still intended that a number of the new units will be let to local independent stores.

==Landmarks==
[[Image:Hooker-Statue.jpeg|thumb|A statue of [[Richard Hooker]] stands on the Cathedral Green.]]

Among the notable buildings in Exeter are:
* The [[Exeter Cathedral|cathedral]], founded in 1050 when the bishop's seat was moved from the nearby town of [[Crediton]] (birthplace of [[Saint Boniface]]) because Exeter's Roman walls offered better protection against "pirates", presumably [[Viking]]s. A statue of [[Richard Hooker (theologian)|Richard Hooker]], the 16th century [[Anglican]] [[theology|theologian]], who was born in Exeter, has a prominent place in the Cathedral Close.
* The [[ruins]] of [[Rougemont Castle]], built soon after the [[Norman Conquest]]; later parts of the castle were still in use as an [[Assize court]] until early 2006 when a new [[Crown Court]]s building opened. A plaque near the ruined Norman gatehouse recalls that in 1685 [[Alice Molland]], the last person executed for [[witchcraft]] in England, was imprisoned in Exeter. The future of the castle is at the moment uncertain, but moves are afoot to alter its use, possibly to a restaurant and housing.
* The [[Guildhall]], the oldest municipal building in England still in use.
* Mols Coffee House Historic building in the Cathedral close.
* The [[Guild]] of [[Tucker]]s and [[Weaver (occupation)|Weavers]], a fine old building that is still used for smart functions.
* The [[Custom House]] in the attractive Quay area, which is the oldest brick building surviving in the city.
* [[St Nicholas Priory]] in Mint Lane, the remains of a [[monastery]], later used as a private house and now a museum owned by the city council.
* A number of medieval churches including [[St Mary]] Steps which has an elaborate clock.
* "The House That Moved", a 14th century [[Tudor]] building, earned its name in 1961 when it was moved from its original location on the corner of Edmund Street in order for a new road to be built in its place. Weighing more than twenty-one tonnes, it was strapped together and slowly moved a few inches at a time to its present day position.
*[[Parliament Street, Exeter|Parliament Street]] in the city centre is one of the narrowest streets in the United Kingdom (see photograph).
*The [[Butts Ferry]], an ancient [[cable ferry]] across the River Exe.

[[Image:Rougemontcastle.jpg|thumb|left|Ruined gatehouse at [[Rougemont Castle]]. Note the red sandstone, characteristic of many older Exeter buildings.]]

Many of these are built in the local dark [[red sandstone]], which gives its name to the castle and the park that now surrounds it (Rougemont means red hill). 

[[Northernhay Gardens]] located just outside the castle, is the oldest public open space in the whole of England, being originally laid out in 1612 as a pleasure walk for Exeter residents. Much of Northernhay Gardens now represent [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] design, with a beautiful display of trees, mature shrubs and bushes and plenty of flower beds. There are also many statues here, most importantly the [[war memorial]] by John Angel and the [[Deerstalker]] by E.B. Stephens. The [[Volunteer]] [[Memorial]] from 1895, also in the gardens, commemorates the formation of the 1st [[Rifle]] [[Volunteers]] in 1852. Other statues include [[John Dinham]], [[Thomas Dyke Acland]] and [[Stafford Northcote]] (a local landowner who was a [[Victorian]] [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]).

==Transport==
The [[M5 motorway]] to [[Bristol]] and [[Birmingham]] starts at Exeter, and connects at Bristol with the [[M4 motorway|M4]] to [[London]] and [[South Wales]]. The older [[A30 road]] provides a more direct route to London via the [[A303 road|A303]] and [[M3 motorway|M3]]. The M5 is the modern lowest bridging point of the [[River Exe]]. Going westwards, the [[A38 road|A38]] connects Exeter to [[Plymouth]] and south east [[Cornwall]], whilst the A30 continues via [[Okehampton]] to north and west Cornwall. Travel by car in the city is often difficult with regular jams centred on the Exe Bridges area. To address the problem, [[Devon County Council]] is considering the introduction of [[congestion charge]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/6125042.stm|title=Drivers facing congestion charge|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2006-11-07|accessdate=2008-07-13}}</ref>

Exeter's main operator of local buses is [[Stagecoach Devon]], which operates most of the services in the city. [[Dartline]] is a minor operator in the City. Former Cooks Coaches were taken over by [[Stagecoach Devon| Stagecoach]] forming Stagecoach Cooks Coaches. Western [[Greyhound]] is also a main operator connecting Exeter to Cornwall, [[Somerset]] and many different places in [[South West England]].
High Street, pedestrianised except for bus and bicycle traffic, serves as the main hub for local buses. Country and express services operate from the city's bus station, in Paris Street, which intersects High Street at its eastern end; some also call at [[Exeter St Davids railway station]] for direct connection to train services. Country bus services, mostly operated by Stagecoach, run from Exeter to most places in East and [[North Devon]], but some are very infrequent. Regional express services run to [[Plymouth]], [[Torbay]], [[Bude]], and along the [[Jurassic Coast]] to [[Lyme Regis]] and [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]], some operated by Stagecoach and others by [[first group plc|First Bus]]. [[National Express]] operates long distance routes, for example to [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]] and [[London]].

There are two main line [[railway]] routes from Exeter to London, the faster [[Reading to Plymouth Line|route via Taunton to London Paddington]] and the slower [[West of England Main Line]] via [[Salisbury, England|Salisbury]] to [[Waterloo station|London Waterloo]]. Another main line, the [[Cross-Country Route]], links Exeter with [[Bristol]], [[Birmingham]], the [[Midlands]], [[Northern England]], and [[Scotland]]. Many trains on all three lines continue westwards from Exeter, variously serving [[Torbay]], [[Plymouth]] and [[Cornwall]]. Local branch lines run to [[Paignton]] (see [[Riviera Line]]), [[Exmouth, Devon|Exmouth]] (see [[Avocet Line]]) and [[Barnstaple]] (see [[Tarka Line]]). There is also a summer weekend service to [[Okehampton]] for access to [[Dartmoor]]. Exeter is served by two main railway stations. [[Exeter St Davids railway station|Exeter St Davids]] is served by all services, whilst [[Exeter Central railway station|Exeter Central]] is more convenient for the city centre but served only by local services and the main line route to London Waterloo. There are also six suburban stations, [[Topsham, Devon|Topsham]], [[St James Park railway station|St James Park]], [[Exeter St Thomas railway station|Exeter St Thomas]], [[Polsloe Bridge railway station|Polsloe Bridge]], [[Pinhoe railway station|Pinhoe]] and [[Digby and Sowton railway station|Digby & Sowton]], served only by local services.

[[Exeter International Airport]] lies east of the city and the local [[airline]], previously called [[Jersey European]] and [[British European]] but now known as [[Flybe]], is a significant local employer. The airport offers a range of scheduled flights to [[UK]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] regional airports and [[Charter airline|charter]] flights including a seasonal service to [[Toronto]], [[Canada]]. Connections to international hubs began with [[Paris Charles de Gaulle]] in 2005 and later a daily service to [[Amsterdam Schiphol Airport]].

The [[Exeter Canal]] was built in 1558, making it one of the oldest artificial waterways in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. It was cut to bypass [[weir]]s that had been built across the [[River Exe]] to prevent trade in the city and to force boats to unload at [[Topsham, Devon|Topsham]] from where the [[Earl of Devon|Earls of Devon]] were able to exact large tolls to transport goods to Exeter. Originally 3 feet deep and 16 feet wide (0.9 m by 5 m), it ran 1.75 miles (2.8 km) from just below the [[Countess Wear|Countess Weir]] to the centre of Exeter. It was later extended to Topsham, deepened and widened, and was successful until the middle of the 19th century since when its use gradually declined - the last commercial use was in 1972. However it is now widely used for leisure purposes, and the city basin is being included as part of a £24 million redevelopment scheme.

==Education==
*The [[University of Exeter]] has two campuses in the city, both notable for their attractive parkland. It is one of the largest employers in the city.
*Exeter is one of the four main sites of the [[University of Plymouth]]
*The [[Peninsula Medical School]], a joint operation of the two universities, has one of its main sites in Exeter
*St Loye's School of Health Studies, well-known for training in [[occupational therapy]] has now been incorporated into the University of Plymouth.
*[[Exeter College]] is a major [[further education]] college. It operates as a [[sixth form]] for the entire [[maintained school]] sector in the city.
*For about 30 years the city of Exeter operated a [[maintained school]] system in which the divisions between phases came at different ages from most of the [[United Kingdom]], with first, middle and high rather than infant, junior and secondary schools, so that children transferred between schools at the age of about 8 and 12 rather than 7 and 11. From 2005, however, it has adopted the more usual pattern, because of the pressures of the UK [[National Curriculum]].

The changeover back from the structure led to a city wide, PFI funded, rebuilding programme for the [[high school]]s and led to the changing of names for some schools. Following the reorganisation there are 25 [[primary school]]s, 4 referral schools, 3 [[special school]]s and 5 [[secondary school]]s within Exeter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/index/learning/schools/locations_and_details.htm|title=Schools, locations and details|work=Devon County Council website|accessdate=2008-07-19}}</ref> The secondary schools are:
*Isca College of Media Arts (formerly Priory High School)
*[[St James' School]] (formerly St James' High School)
*St Luke's (Church of England) Science & Sports College (formerly Vincent Thompson High School)
*St Peter's Church of England Aided School - A [[Language College]]
*[[West Exe Technology College]] (formerly St Thomas High School)

In addition:
*[[Exeter School]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exeterschool.devon.sch.uk|title=Exeter School Website|accessdate=2008-07-19}}</ref> is the oldest of several [[public schools]] in the city.
*Exeter is home to several substantial [[language school]]s

The ''[[Exeter Book]]'', an original manuscript and one of the most important documents in [[Anglo-Saxon]] literature, is kept in the vaults of [[Exeter Cathedral]]. The Exeter Book dates back to the 10th century and is one of four manuscripts that between them contain virtually all the surviving poetry in [[Old English language|Old English]]. It includes most of the more highly regarded shorter poems, some religious pieces, and a series of [[riddle]]s, a handful of which are famously lewd. Some of the riddles are inscribed on a highly polished steel obelisk in High Street, placed on [[30 March]] [[2005]].
