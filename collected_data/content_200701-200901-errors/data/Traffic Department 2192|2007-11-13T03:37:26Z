'''''Traffic Department 2192''''' was a top down [[shooter (game)|shooter]] game for [[IBM PC compatible|IBM PC]], developed by [[P-Squared Productions]] and released in [[1994]] by [[Safari software|Safari Software]] and distributed by [[Epic Games|Epic Megagames]]. The full game contains three episodes (Alpha, Beta, Gamma), each with twenty missions, in which the player pilots a "hoverskid" about a war-torn city to complete certain mission objectives. After publisher Safari Software was absorbed into Epic, the game was sold via [[Epic Classics]] for a time. The game was released as [[freeware]] under the [[Creative Commons]] Attribution-NoDerivs 3.0 License in 2007.[http://www.classicdosgames.com/epic.html]

The game was scored by [[Robert A. Allen]]. However, [[John Pallett-Plowright]] wrote ''Satair'', and his 13-year-old brother, [[Michael Pallett-Plowright]], also known as Owen Pallett, wrote ''Menu'', ''Vulture'', ''Intro 2'' and ''Death''. [http://www.zoilus.com/documents//2005/000631.php]

The most notable aspect of the series is the detailed and often complex script by Christopher Perkins. The game features lengthy [[cutscene]]s before and after each of the sixty missions. Each cutscene spans across multiple scenes, giving the game's storyline a reported length of 50,000 words. The cutscenes are made up of conversations between two or more characters on the screen with static 3D images of locations cut between each scene. The game's dialogue features both [[profanity]] and sexually-suggestive language, but there is an option at the start of the game to disable all mature content.

Over the years the series has developed a small dedicated fan base that has produced [[Lego]] models of the various "skids" in the series. [http://nightsolo.net/lego/Hornet/Hornet.html][http://www.nightsolo.net/lego/Vltr1/Vltr1.html]

==Story==
The player takes on the role of '''Lieutenant Marta Louise Velasquez''', a hot-tempered young pilot working for the Traffic Department in the city of Vulthaven, on the planet Seche, in the year 2192. Since the vile gang known as the Vultures began attempts to take over the planet, the Traffic Department has become the only law-enforcement in the city. As the game's introduction explains, fourteen years earlier, Velasquez saw her father Ric killed by the Vultures while returning from garrison duty.

The story deals with Velasquez's aggressive attitude towards everybody she meets, apparently caused by the painful memory of her father. Intertwined is a complex [[science fiction]] story of [[cloning]], [[mind control]] and [[cybernetics]], combined with a classic tale of betrayal, [[Espionage|infiltration]], and [[War|warfare]].
