The '''Asian giant hornet''', ''Vespa mandarinia'', also known as the Japanese hornet and known colloquially as the yak-killer hornet, is the world's largest [[hornet]], native to temperate and tropical Eastern Asia. Its body length is approximately 50.8&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]] (2.0&nbsp;[[inch|in]]), with a wingspan of about 76&nbsp;mm (3&nbsp;in).<ref name="ngeo">{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/10/1025_021025_GiantHornets.html|title="Hornets From Hell" Offer Real-Life Fright}}</ref> Queens may reach a length of 55&nbsp;mm (2.2&nbsp;in).<ref>[http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080902202334AAWgN7q]</ref>  Due to its size, it is known in Japan as the {{nihongo|''sparrow bee''|雀蜂 or 胡蜂|oo-suzumebachi}}.

== Anatomy ==
The [[head]] of the hornet is orange and quite wide in comparison to other [[hornet]] species. The [[eye#compound eyes|compound eye]]s and [[ocellus|ocelli]] are dark brown, and the [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] are dark brown with orange [[antenna (biology)|scape]]s. The [[clypeus]] (the shield-like plate on the front of the head) is orange and coarsely punctured; the posterior side of the clypeus has narrow, rounded lobes. The [[mandible]] is large and orange with a black tooth (inner biting surface).

The [[thorax]] and [[propodeum]] (the segment which forms the [[anatomical terms of location#anterior and posterior|posterior]] part of the thorax) of the Asian giant hornet has a distinctive golden tint and a large [[scutellum (entomology)|scutellum]] (a shield-like scale on the thorax) that has a deeply-impressed [[anatomical terms of location#Radially-symmetrical organisms|medial]] line; the postscutellum (the plate behind the scutellum) bulges and overhangs the propodeum. The hornet's [[forelimb|foreleg]]s are orange with dark brown [[Arthropod leg|tarsi]] (the [[Anatomical terms of location#proximal and distal|distal]]—furthest down—part of the leg); the midlegs and [[hind limb|hindleg]]s are dark brown. [[Insect wing|Wing]]s are a dark brownish-gray. The [[Tegula (anatomy)|tegula]]e are brown.

The [[gaster]] (the portion of the abdomen behind the [[thorax]]–[[abdomen]] connection) is dark brown with a white, powdery covering; with narrow yellow bands at the posterior margins of the tergite, the sixth segment is entirely yellow.  It is similar in appearance to the established [[European hornet]], ''Vespa crabro''.

== Geographic distribution ==
[[Image:Picture Vespa.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Asian giant hornet]]
It can be found in [[Primorsky Krai]], [[Korea]], [[China]], [[Taiwan]] (where it is called 虎頭蜂; "tiger head bee"), [[Indochina]], [[Nepal]], [[India]], and [[Sri Lanka]], but is most common in [[mountain]]ous areas of Japan.

== Sting ==
The [[stinger]] of the Asian giant hornet is about 6&nbsp;mm (¼&nbsp;in) in length,<ref name="ngeo">{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/10/1025_021025_GiantHornets.html|title="Hornets From Hell" Offer Real-Life Fright}}</ref> and injects an especially potent [[venom]] that contains, like many bee and wasp venoms, a [[cytolysis|cytolytic]] [[peptide]] (specifically, a [[mastoparan]]) that can damage tissue by stimulating [[Phospholipase A|phospholipase]] action,<ref>Hirai, Y., Yasuhara, T., Yoshida, H., Nakajima, T. (1981) A new mast cell degranulating peptide, mastoparan-M, in the venom of the hornet ''Vespa mandarinia'' Biomed. Res. 2:447-449</ref> in addition to its own intrinsic phospholipase.<ref>Abe, T., Sugita, M., Fujikura, T., Hiyoshi, J., Akasu, M. (2000) Giant hornet (''Vespa mandarinia'') venomous phospholipases – The purification, characterization and inhibitory properties by biscoclaurine alkaloids. Toxicon 38:1803-1816</ref> Masato Ono, an [[entomology|entomologist]] at [[Tamagawa University]] near [[Tokyo]], described the sensation as feeling "like a hot nail being driven into my leg."<ref name="ngeo">{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/10/1025_021025_GiantHornets.html|title="Hornets From Hell" Offer Real-Life Fright}}</ref>.

An allergic human stung by the giant hornet may die from an [[allergy|allergic reaction]] to the venom; but the venom contains a [[neurotoxin]] called [[mandaratoxin]]<ref>Abe, T., Kawai, N., Niwa, A. (1982) Purification and properties of a presynaptically acting neurotoxin, mandaratoxin, from hornet (''Vespa mandarinia''). Biochemistry 21:1693-7</ref> which can be lethal to people who are not allergic if the dose is sufficient. Between 20 and 40 people die each year in Japan after being stung by giant hornets.<ref>"Killer hornets get a taste for humans", http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article582267.ece</ref>

A few interesting notes on ''Vespa mandarinia'''s venom and stinger:
* The venom contains at least eight distinct chemicals, some of which damage tissue, some of which cause pain, and at least one which has an odor that attracts more hornets to the victim.
* The venom contains 5% [[acetylcholine]], a greater concentration than is present in bee or other wasp venoms. Acetylcholine stimulates the pain nerve fibers, intensifying the pain of the sting.
* ''Vespa mandarinia'' uses its large crushing mandibles, rather than its sting, to kill prey.
* The venom of the Asian giant hornet is more toxic than that of most other bees or wasps, giving this species one of the greatest lethal capacities per colony.
* The enzyme in the venom is so strong that it can dissolve human tissue. On some occasions, the sting may be compared to the effects of a [[spider bite]].
* Like all hornets, ''V. mandarinia'' has a barbless stinger, allowing it to sting repeatedly.
* Its' sting vemon will also cause more hornets to be drawn to the victim.

==Sting Prevention and Precautions==
*Japanese Hornets protect their nest and will attack humans that venture within about 10 meters. They will start to swarm and then  attack en masse, sometimes emitting a loud noise. It is advisable therefore to retreat immediately from groups of Japanese Hornets, and at great haste should they start to emit a rattling noise.
*Japanese Hornets will also display similarly aggressive behavior to protect food sources such as secretions of the sap of trees (e.g. Sawtooth Oak) particularly in summer, and hives of [[honey bee]]s particularly in autumn (fall), and become generally aggressive when attacking other hornet nests. 
*Some types of [[perfume]] contain [[pheromone]]s, particularly 2-pentanol, that are similar to the hornet pheromones that encourage a group attack. The use of perfumes and other fragrances when in areas where Japanese Hornets are present, such as mountain paths, is strongly discouraged. 
*Black clothes are said to increase the risk of Japanese Hornet attack. White clothes may also be particularly at risk at night. 
*Single stings can also be fatal, so even in the absence of small groups of hornets, extreme precaution is advised, particularly (but not only) if one has been stung before since there is a greater risk of an extreme allergic reaction.  
*Japanese Hornets are attracted to beverages containing [[alcohol]] and [[glucose]], so care should be taken when drinking from a can or other vessel containing such liquids that has been left unattended for long enough for a hornet to enter, especially when in mountainous regions where Japanese Hornets are common.

==Sting First Aid==
The sting of a Japanese Hornet is extremely painful and potentially fatal, and contains chemical pheromones that attract and encourage other hornets to attack the same victim. 
*Once stung, one should attempt to retreat quickly without undue movement that might increase the chance of multiple attacks.
*Compression and/or the use of a vacuum device to remove venom from the wound is recommended. Do not attempt to use oral suction to remove venom, since the venom would be transmitted to the mouth. 
*Wash the wound with water or better,
*Use liquids (such as tea or wine) containing tannin to wash the wound since tannin combats the effect of one or more of the toxins. 
*The use of creams containing antihistamines and steroids is also recommended.
*While cooling the wound, seek medical treatment immediately. 
*Those that have been stung previously are at greater risk of [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic shock]]. Shock is the cause of the majority of fatalities from Japanese Hornet stings.

==Predation==
The Asian giant hornet is a relentless hunter that preys on other large [[insect]]s such as [[bee]]s, other hornet species, and [[mantis]]es.

]]

The hornets often attack [[honey bee]] hives with the goal of obtaining the honey bee [[larvae]]. A single scout, sometimes two or three, will cautiously approach the nest, giving off pheromones which will lead the other hornets to the hive's location. 

The hornets can devastate a colony of honey bees: a single hornet can kill as many as 40 honey bees per minute thanks to their large mandibles which can quickly strike and decapitate a bee. It takes only a few of these hornets a few hours to exterminate the population of a 30,000-member hive, leaving a trail of severed insect heads and limbs. The [[European honey bee]]s ''Apis mellifera'' have small stings which do little damage to hornets that are three times their size and twenty times their weight. The honey bees make futile solo attacks without mounting a collective defense, and are easily killed individually by the hornets. Once a hive is emptied of all defending bees, the hornets feed on the honey and carry the larvae back to feed to their own larvae. The hornets can fly up to 60 miles (95 km) in a single day, at speeds up to 25 [[Miles per hour|mph]] or 40 km/h.<ref>[http://www.vespa-crabro.de/vespa-mandarinia.htm ''Vespa mandarinia'' (Asian Giant Hornet) page, vespa-crabro.de]</ref>

Adult hornets cannot digest solid protein, so the hornets do not eat their prey, but chew them into a paste and feed them to their larvae. The larvae produce a clear liquid, ''vespa amino acid mixture'', which the adults consume; larvae of social [[Vespidae]] produce these secretions, the exact amino acid composition varying considerably among species.<ref>Hunt, J. H., I. Baker, and H. G. Baker. 1982. Similarity of amino acids in nectar and larval saliva: the nutritional basis for trophallaxis in social wasps. Evolution 36: 1318-1322</ref> The passing of nutrition to adult wasps by larvae is widespread in these wasps, and not restricted to the genus ''[[hornet|Vespa]]''.

===Native honey bees===

]]
Although a handful of Asian giant hornets can easily defeat the defenses of many individual honey bees, whose small stings cannot inflict much damage against such a large predator, the Japanese honey bee (''[[Apis cerana|Apis cerana japonica]]'') possesses a collective defense against them.

When a hornet scout locates and approaches a Japanese honey bee hive it will emit specific pheromonal hunting signals. When the honey bees detect these pheromones, a hundred or so will gather near the entrance of the nest and keep it open, apparently to draw the hornet further into the hive or allow it to enter on its own. As the hornet enters the nest, a large mob of about five hundred honey bees surrounds it, completely covering it and preventing it from moving, and begin quickly vibrating their flight muscles.  This has the effect of raising the temperature of the honey bee mass to 47 °C (117 °F). The honey bees can just about tolerate this temperature, but the hornet cannot survive more than 45 °C (113 °F), so it dies. Often several bees perish along with the intruder, but the death of the hornet scout prevents it from summoning reinforcements which would wipe out the colony.<ref>[http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/midorcas/animalphysiology/websites/2001/Thawley/defense.htm ''Defensive Adaptations: Heat Tolerance As A Weapon'', davidson.edu]</ref>

==Life Cycle==

==The hornet and the Japanese diet==

In Japan's mountain villages, the larvae and pupae of hornets are valued as a delicacy. They are eaten deep fried or as a kind of hornet [[sashimi]].

===''Hornet supplement'' manufacturers===

Recently, several companies in Asia and Europe have begun to manufacture [[dietary supplement]]s and [[energy drink]]s which contain synthetic versions of secretions of the larvae of ''Vespa mandarinia'', which the adult hornets usually consume. The manufacturers of these products make claims that consuming the larval hornet secretions (marketed as "hornet juice") will enhance human endurance because of the effect it has on adult hornets' performance. Because these products are marketed as dietary supplement rather than pharmaceuticals, they do not have to support their claims.  Some studies<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12831267&dopt=Abstract ''Effect of amino acid mixture intake on physiological responses and rating of perceived exertion during cycling exercise''], PubMed</ref>, however, have suggested that the vespa amino acid mixture itself may influence animal performance in minor ways.

One such company, VAAM, manufactures several such hornet-themed supplements. According to the product's nutritional information, these all consist mostly of common amino acids and flavorings.<ref>{{cite web | title = VAAM Ingredients & Nutritional Information | url = http://www.vaam-power.com/vaam_ingredients.html | accessdate = 2008-09-13}}</ref>
