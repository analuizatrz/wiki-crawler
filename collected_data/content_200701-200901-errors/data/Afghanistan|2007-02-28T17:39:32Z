'''Afg<u>h</u>ānistān''', officially the '''[[Islamic republic|Islamic Republic]] of Afghanistan''' ([[Pashto language|Pashto]]: '''د افغانستان اسلامي جمهوریت''', [[Persian language|Persian]]: '''جمهوری اسلامی افغانستان'''), is a [[landlocked]] country located in the heart of [[Asia]] and is variously designated within [[Central Asia|Central]] and/or [[South Asia]] as well as the [[Middle East]].<ref>National Geographic - ''Afghanistan Profile''[http://www3.nationalgeographic.com/places/countries/country_afghanistan.html LINK] (accessed [[20 January]] [[2006]])</ref><ref>CIA Factbook - ''Afghanistan''[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/af.html#Geo LINK] (accessed [[20 January]] [[2006]])</ref><ref>Middle East Institute - ''Afghanistan''[http://www.mideasti.org/countries/countries.php?name=afghanistan LINK] (accessed [[20 January]] [[2006]])</ref> It has religious, ethno-linguistic, and geographic links with most of its neighbours. It is largely bordered by [[Pakistan]] in the south and east,<ref>Part of the region bordering Pakistan falls in the disputed [[Kashmir]] region which is claimed by India</ref>  [[Iran]] in the west, [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Tajikistan]] in the north, and the [[People's Republic of China]] in the far northeast. The name Afghanistan means the ''"Land of [[Pashtun people|Afghans]]"''. 

Afghanistan is a mosaic of ethnic groups, and a crossroads between the [[Eastern world|East]] and the [[Western world|West]]. It has been an ancient focal-point of trade and migration. The region of modern Afghanistan has seen many invaders and conquerors come and go, including the [[Persian Empire]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Arab Empire|Muslim Arabs]], [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Mongol Empire|Mongol nomads]], the [[British Empire]] and the [[Soviet Union]].

[[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] created Afghanistan in the middle of the eighteenth century as a large state, with its capital at [[Kandahar]].<ref>Britannica Concise - ''Ahmad Shah Durrani''...[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9354776/Ahmad-Shah-Durrani Link]</ref> Subsequently, most of its territories were ceded to former neighboring countries by the early twentieth century, due to regional conflicts. On [[August 19]] [[1919]], following the [[European_influence_in_Afghanistan#Third_Anglo-Afghan_War_and_Independence|third Anglo-Afghan war]], the country regained full independence from [[Great Britain]] over its [[foreign affairs]]. 

Since [[1979]], Afghanistan has suffered almost continuous conflict, beginning with the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|Soviet invasion]] followed by a [[Afghan Civil War|civil war]] and finally by the [[2001 war in Afghanistan|2001 US intervention]] in which the ruling [[Taliban]] government was toppled. In December 2001, the [[United Nations Security Council]] authorized the creation of an [[International Security Assistance Force|International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)]]. This force, composed of [[NATO]] troops, has been involved in assisting the government of President [[Hamid Karzai]] in establishing authority across the nation. In 2005, the [[United States]] and Afghanistan signed a strategic partnership agreement committing both nations to a long-term relationship. In the meantime, over 18  billion [[US dollar]]s have also been provided by the international community for the reconstruction of the country.

== Etymology ==
{{main|Origins of the name Afghan|List of country name etymologies}}
The name ''Af<u>gh</u>ānistān'' translates to the ''"[[-stan|Land of Afghans]]"''. Its modern usage derives from the word ''[[Afghan]]''.

====Origin of the word "Afghan"====
The [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] began using the term ''Afghan'' as a name for themselves from at least the Islamic period and onwards. According to W. K. Frazier Tyler, M. C. Gillet and several other scholars, ''"The word Afghan first appears in history in the [[Hudud ul-'alam min al-mashriq ila al-maghrib|Hudud-al-Alam]] in 982 AD."'' In this regard, the [[Encyclopædia Iranica]] states:<ref>Ch.M. Kieffer, ''"Afghan"'' (with ref. to ''"Afghanistan: iv. Ethnography"''), in [[Encyclopaedia Iranica]], Online Edition 2006, ([http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v1f5/v1f5a037.html LINK])</ref>
{{cquote|From a more limited, ethnological point of view, "Af<u>gh</u>ān" is the term by which the Persian-speakers of Afghanistan (and the non-Paštō-speaking ethnic groups generally) designate the Paštūn. The equation [of] ''Afghan'' [and] ''Paštūn'' has been propagated all the more, both in and beyond Afghanistan, because the Paštūn tribal confederation is by far the most important in the country, numerically and politically.}}

It further explains:
{{cquote|The term "Af<u>gh</u>ān" has probably designated the Paštūn since ancient times. Under the form ''Avagānā'', this ethnic group is first mentioned by the Indian astronomer Varāha Mihira in the beginning of the [[600|6th century A.D.]] in his ''Brihat-samhita''.}}

This information is supported by traditional [[Pashto|Pashto literature]], for example in the writings of the [[17th century|seventeenth century]] Pashto poet [[Khushal Khan Khattak]]:<ref>''extract from "Passion of the Afghan"'' by [[Khushal Khan Khattak]]; translated by C. Biddulph in ''"Afghan Poetry Of The 17th Century: Selections from the Poems of Khushal Khan Khattak''", [[London]], [[1890]]</ref>
{{cquote|''Pull out your sword and slay any one, that says Pashton and Afghan are not one! Arabs know this and so do Romans: Afghans are Pashtons, Pashtons are Afghans!''}}

====Meaning and origin of the name "Afghanistan"====
The last part of the name, ''[[-stan|-stān]]'', is an [[Indo-Iranian language|Indo-Iranian]] suffix for "place", prominent in many languages of the region.
The term ''"Afghanistan"'', meaning the ''"Land of Afghans"'', was mentioned by the [[16th century|sixteenth century]] [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] [[Babur]] in his [[Baburnama|memoirs]], referring to the territories south of [[Kabul]] that were inhabited by Pashtuns (called ''"Afghans"'' by Babur).<ref>[[Babur|Zāhir ud-Dīn Mohammad Bābur]] in [[Baburnama|Bāburnāma]], ''"Transactions of the year 908"'', translated by John Leyden, Oxford University Press 1921 ([http://persian.packhum.org/persian//pf?file=03501051&ct=92 LINK])</ref>
Regarding the modern nation ''"Afghanistan"'', the [[Encyclopaedia of Islam|Encyclopædia Of Islam]]<ref>M. Longworth Dames/G. Morgenstierne/R. Ghirshman, ''"Af<u>gh</u>ānistān"'', in [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]], Online Edition</ref> states:
{{cquote|Af<u>gh</u>ānistān has borne that name only since the middle of the [[18th century]], when the supremacy of the Afghan race ([[Pashtuns]]) became assured: previously various districts bore distinct appellations, but the country was not a definite political unit, and its component parts were not bound together by any identity of race or language. The earlier meaning of the word was simply “the land of the Afghans”, a limited territory which did not include many parts of the present state but did comprise large districts now either independent or within the boundary of Pakistan.}}

Until the [[19th century]], the name was only used for the traditional lands of the Pashtuns, while the kingdom as a whole was known as the ''Kingdom of Kabul'', as mentioned by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] statesman and historian [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]].<ref>[[Mountstuart Elphinstone|Elphinstone, M.]], ''"Account of the Kingdom of Cabul and its Dependencies in Persia and India"'', [[London]] [[1815]]; published by Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme & Brown</ref> Other parts of the country were at certain periods recognized as independent kingdoms, such as the ''Kingdom of Balkh'' in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.<ref>E. Bowen, ''"A New & Accurate Map of Persia"'' in ''A Complete System Of Geography'', Printed for W. Innys, R. Ware [etc.], [[London]] [[1747]]</ref>  	 

With the expansion and centralization of the country, Afghan authorities adopted and extended the name ''"Afghanistan"'' to the entire kingdom, after its English translation, ''"Afghanland"'', had already appeared in various treaties between [[British Raj]] and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajarid Persia]], referring to the lands that were subject to the [[Pashtun]] [[Barakzai Dynasty]] of Kabul.<ref>E. Huntington, ''"The Anglo-Russian Agreement as to Tibet, Afghanistan, and Persia"'', Bulletin of the American Geographical Society, Vol. 39, No. 11 (1907)</ref> ''"Afghanistan"'' as the name for the entire kingdom was mentioned in [[1857]] by [[Friedrich Engels|Frederick Engels]].<ref name=MECW>MECW Volume 18, p. 40; The New American Cyclopaedia - Vol. I, 1858;...[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/afghanistan/index.htm Link]</ref> It became the official name when the country was recognized by the world community in [[1919]], after regaining its full independence from the British,<ref>M. Ali, ''"Afghanistan: The War of Independence, 1919"'', Kabul [s.n.], [[1960]]</ref> and was confirmed as such in the nation's [[1923]] constitution.<ref>Afghanistan's Constitution of 1923, under ''[[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah Khan]]'', English translation...[http://www.afghan-web.com/history/const/const1923.html Link]</ref>

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Afghanistan}}
[[Image:Afghan_topo_en.jpg|thumb|300px|Topography]]
Afghanistan is a land-locked and [[mountain]]ous country in central Asia, with plains in the north and southwest. The highest point is [[Nowshak]], at 7485&nbsp;m (24,557&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) above sea level. Large parts of the country are dry, and fresh water supplies are limited. Afghanistan has a continental climate, with hot summers and cold winters. The country is frequently subject to minor [[earthquake]]s, mainly in the northeast of [[Hindu Kush]] mountain areas.

At 249,984&nbsp;[[Square mile|mi²]] (647,500&nbsp;[[Square kilometre|km²]]), Afghanistan is the world's 41st-largest country (after [[Myanmar]]). It is comparable in size to [[Somalia]], and is slightly smaller than the US state of [[Texas]].

The country's natural resources include [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]], [[zinc]] and [[iron ore]] in southeastern areas; precious and [[semi-precious stones]] such as [[lapis]], [[emerald]] and [[azure]] in the north-east; and potentially significant [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] reserves in the north. The country also has [[coal]], [[chromite]], [[talc]], [[barites]], [[sulfur]], [[lead]], and [[salt]]. However, these significant mineral and energy resources remain largely untapped due to the effects of the Soviet invasion and the subsequent civil war. Plans are underway to begin extracting them in the near future.<ref name=CIA>CIA World Factbook - ''Afghanistan''...[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/af.html Link]</ref><ref name=AfghanMinerals>Minerals in Afghanistan - ''gold and copper discovered in Afghanistan''...[http://www.bgs.ac.uk/AfghanMinerals/docs/Gold_A4.pdf#search='gold%20and%20copper%20discovered%20in%20afghanistan' Link]</ref><ref name=Eurasianet>Eurasianet.org - Eurasia Insight - ''Afghanistan’s Energy Future and its Potential Implications''...

== History ==
{{main|History of Afghanistan}}
Excavation of prehistoric sites by Louis Dupree, the [[University of Pennsylvania]], the [[Smithsonian Institute]] and others suggests that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities of the area were among the earliest in the world.<ref>Nancy Hatch Dupree - An Historical Guide To Afghanistan - ''Sites in Perspective (Chapter 3)''...[http://www.zharov.com/dupree/chapter03.html Link]</ref><ref>John Ford Shroder, B.S., M.S., Ph.D.

Afghanistan is a country at a unique nexus point where numerous [[Indo-European people|Indo-European]] civilizations have interacted and often fought, and was an important site of early historical activity. Through the ages, the region has been home to various people, among them the [[Aryan]] ([[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]]) tribes, such as the [[Kambojas]], [[Bactrians]], [[Persians]], etc.[[Image:GBA8.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Buddhas of Bamyan]] were the largest [[Buddha]] statues in the world, dating back to the [[1st century|first century]] AD.]]

It also has been invaded or conquered by a host of people, including the [[Median Empire|Median]] and [[Persian Empire]]s, [[Greeks]], [[Kushans]], [[Hepthalites]], [[Arab]]s, [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Mongols]], [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Soviet Union|Soviets]], and most recently by the [[United States|Americans]] and their allies. On other occasions, native entities have invaded or conquered surrounding regions to form empires of their own.

Between 2000 and 1200 [[Before Christ|BC]], waves of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]-speaking [[Aryans]] from the north of [[Amu Darya]] are thought to have flooded into northern Afghanistan and then spreading south towards [[India]] and west towards [[Persia]], setting up a nation that during the rule of [[Medes]] and [[Achaemenids|Achaemenid Persians]] became known as Aryānām Xšaθra or [[Airyanem Vaejah|Airyānem Vāejah]]. Later, during the rule of [[Ashkanian]], [[Sasanian]] and after, it was called Erānshahr ({{PerB|<big>ايرانشهر </big>}} - ''Īrānšahr'') meaning "Dominion of the [[Aryans]]", which included large parts of [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Iran]] and modern-day [[Central Asia]] (Afghanistan, [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], the western part of [[Pakistan]], etc., depending on differing interpretations).

It has been speculated that [[Zoroastrianism]] might have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 to 800 BC{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Ancient [[Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian languages]], such as [[Avestan]], may have been spoken in this region around a similar time-line with the rise of Zoroastrianism. By the middle of the sixth century BC, the [[Persian Empire]] of the [[Achaemenids]] supplanted the [[Medes|Median Empire]] and incorporated what was known as [[Persia]] to the Greeks within its boundaries; and by 330 BC, [[Alexander the Great]] had invaded Afghanistan and conquered the surrounding regions. Following Alexander's brief occupation, the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] successor states of the [[Seleucids]] and [[Greco-Bactrians]] controlled the area, while the [[Maurya]]s from India annexed the southeast for a time and introduced [[Buddhism]] to the region until the area returned to the Bactrian rule.  

During the [[1st century|first century]] [[Common Era|CE]], the [[Kushan]]s created a vast empire centered in modern Afghanistan and were patrons of Buddhist culture. The Kushans were defeated by the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] in the 3rd century. Although various rulers calling themselves Kushans (and generally known as ''Kushano-Sasanians'') continued to rule at least parts of the region today known as Afghanistan, they were probably more or less subject to the Sassanids.<ref>Dani, A. H. and B. A. Litvinsky. "The Kushano-Sasanian Kingdom." In: ''History of civilizations of Central Asia, Volume III. The crossroads of civilizations: A.D. 250 to 750''. Litvinsky, B. A., ed., 1996.

ISBN 92-3-103211-9</ref> who, in turn, were replaced by the short-lived but powerful [[Hephthalites]], as rulers of the region in the first half of the 5th century.<ref>Litvinsky, B. A. "The Hephthalite Empire." In: ''History of civilizations of Central Asia, Volume III. The crossroads of civilizations: A.D. 250 to 750''. Litvinsky, B. A., ed., 1996, Paris: UNESCO Publishing, pp. 135-162. ISBN 92-3-103211-9</ref> The Hephthalites were defeated by the Sasanian king [[Khosrau I]] in 557 CE, who re-established Sasanian power in Persia. However, the successors of Kushans and Hepthalites established a small dynasty in [[Kabulistan]] called [[Kushano-Hephthalites]] or [[Kushano-Hephthalite|Kabul-Shahan]] and were later defeated by the Muslim Armies.

The Sassanids ruled up to the seventh century, when [[Muslim]] [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Arab armies conquered the Sassanid Empire]] following the [[Battle of al-Qādisiyyah]]. The Arab [[Abbasid]]s conquered the northwest section of Afghanistan by the ninth century and administered that region as part of Khorasan. 

In the [[Middle Ages]], up to the [[18th century]], the region was known as [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]].<ref>Ghubar, Mir Ghulam Mohammad, ''Khorasan'', 1937 Kabul Printing House, Kabul)</ref><ref>''Tajikistan Development Gateway'' from [http://www.developmentgateway.org/aboutus The Development Gateway Foundation] - History of Afghanistan [http://www.tajik-gateway.org/index.phtml?lang=en&id=1005 LINK]</ref> Several important centers of <u>Kh</u>orāsān are thus located in modern Afghanistan, such as [[Balkh]], [[Herat]], [[Ghazni]] and [[Kabul]].

The region became the center of various important empires, including that of the [[Samanid]]s (875-999), [[Ghaznavid Empire|Ghaznavids]] (977-1187), [[Seljukids]] (1037-1194), [[Ghurids]] (1149-1212), and [[Timurid Dynasty|Timurids]] (1370-1506). Among them, the periods of Ghaznavids<ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica, Online Edition - ''Ghaznavid Dynasty'' [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9036676/Ghaznavid-Dynasty LINK]</ref> of Ghazni, and  Timurids<ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica, Online Edition - ''Timurid Dynasty'' [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9072546/Timurid-Dynasty LINK]</ref> of Herat are considered as some of the most brilliant eras of Afghanistan's history. 

In [[1219]], the region was overrun by the [[Mongols]] under [[Genghis Khan]], who devastated the land. Their rule continued with the [[Ilkhanate]]s, and was extended further following the invasion of [[Timur|Timur Lang]], a ruler from Central Asia. In 1504, [[Babur]], a descendant of both Timur Lang and Genghis Khan, established the Mughal Empire with its capital at [[Kabul]]. By the early 1700s, Afghanistan was controlled by several ruling groups: [[Uzbeks]] to the north, [[Safavids]] to the west and the remaining larger area by the Mughals or self ruled by local Afghan tribes.

In [[1709]], [[Mirwais Khan Hotak]], a local Afghan (''Pashtun'') from the [[Ghilzai]] clan, overthrew and killed [[Gurgin Khan]], the Safavid governor of [[Kandahar Province|Kandahar]]. Mirwais Khan successfully defeated the Persians, who were attempting to convert the local population of Kandahar from [[Sunni]] to [[Shia]] sect of [[Islam]]. Mirwais held the region of Kandahar until his death in 1715 and was succeeded by his son Mir Mahmud Hotaki. In 1722, Mir Mahmud led an Afghan army to [[Isfahan]] (now in [[Iran]]), sacked the city and proclaimed himself [[Shah of Persia|King of Persia]]. However, the great majority still rejected the Afghan regime as usurping, and after the massacre of thousands of civilians in Isfahan by the Afghans &ndash; including more than three thousand religious scholars, nobles, and members of the Safavid family &ndash; the [[Hotaki|Hotaki dynasty]] was eventually removed from power by a new ruler, [[Nadir Shah]] of Persia.<ref>Prof. D.

In 1738, Nadir Shah and his army, which included four thousand Pashtuns of the [[Abdali]] clan,<ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica - ''The Durrani dynasty (from Afghanistan)''...[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-21396/Afghanistan Link]</ref> conquered the region of Kandahar; in the same year he occupied [[Ghazni]], Kabul and [[Lahore]]. On June 19, 1747, Nadir Shah was assassinated, possibly planned by his nephew [[Adil Shah|Ali Qoli]]. In the same year, one of Nadir's military commanders and personal bodyguard, [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]], a Pashtun from the Abdali clan, called for a [[loya jirga]] following Nadir's death. The Afghans gathered at [[Kandahar]] and chose Ahmad Shah as their King. Since then, he is regarded as the founder of modern Afghanistan.<ref name="CIA">CIA World Factbook - ''Afghanistan''...[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/af.html Link]</ref><ref name=Britannica>Encyclopaedia Britannica - ''Ahmad Shah Durrani''...[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9004137/Ahmad-Shah-Durrani?source=YNFAF Link]</ref><ref>Nancy Hatch Dupree - An Historical Guide To Afghanistan - ''The South (Chapter 16)''...[http://www.zharov.com/dupree/chapter16.html Link]</ref> After the inauguration, he changed his title or clans' name to ''"Durrani"'', which derives from the Persian word ''Durr'', meaning ''"Pearl"''.<ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica - ''The Durrani dynasty (from Afghanistan)''...[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-21396/Afghanistan Link]</ref>  

[[Image:Mohammed Zahir Shah.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]] became the youngest, longest-serving and last king of Afghanistan.]]
By 1751, Ahmad Shah Durrani and his Afghan army conquered the entire present-day Afghanistan, Pakistan, Khorasan and Kohistan provinces of Iran, along with [[Delhi]] in [[India]].<ref name=MECW>MECW Volume 18, p. 40; The New American Cyclopaedia - Vol. I, 1858;...[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/afghanistan/index.htm Link]</ref> In October [[1772]], Ahmad Shah retired to his home in [[Maruf]], Kandahar, where he died peacefully. He was succeeded by his son, [[Timur Shah Durrani]], who transferred the capital from Kandahar to Kabul. Timur died in 1793 and was finally succeeded by his son [[Zaman Shah Durrani]]. 

During the [[19th century|nineteenth century]], following the [[Anglo-Afghan wars]] (fought 1839-42, 1878-80, and lastly in 1919) and the ascension of the [[Barakzai|Barakzai dynasty]], Afghanistan saw much of its territory and autonomy ceded to the [[United Kingdom]]. The UK exercised a great deal of influence, and it was not until [[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah Khan]] acceded to the throne in 1919 that Afghanistan re-gained complete independence over its [[foreign affairs]] (see "[[The Great Game]]"). During the period of British intervention in Afghanistan, ethnic Pashtun territories were divided by the [[Durand Line]]. This would lead to strained relations between Afghanistan and [[British India]] &ndash; and later the new state of Pakistan &ndash; over what came to be known as the [[Pashtunistan]] debate.  

The longest period of stability in Afghanistan was between 1933 and 1973, when the country was under the rule of [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|King Zahir Shah]]. However, in 1973, Zahir Shah's brother-in-law, [[Sardar Mohammed Daoud|Sardar Daoud Khan]] launched a bloodless coup. Daoud Khan and his entire family were later murdered in 1978, when the [[communist]] [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] launched a coup known as the [[Khalq|Great Saur Revolution]] and took over the government. 

[[image:Mohammed_Daoud_Khan.jpg|thumb|left|110px|[[Sardar Mohammed Daoud|Sardar Daoud Khan]] was President of the Republic of Afghanistan from 1973 to 1978.]]
Opposition against, and conflict within, the series of communist governments that followed, was considerable. As part of a [[Cold War]] strategy, in 1979 the [[United States government]] under President [[Jimmy Carter]] and National Security Advisor [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] began to covertly fund and train anti-government [[Mujahideen]] forces through the Pakistani secret service agency known as [[Inter Services Intelligence]] (ISI), who were derived from discontented Muslims in the country that opposed the official atheism of the Marxist regime. In order to bolster the local Communist forces, the Soviet Union&mdash;citing the 1978 Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Good Neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries &mdash;intervened on [[December 24]], [[1979]]. According to media and official government sources, between 110,000 to 150,000 [[Red Army|Soviet troops]], assisted by another 100,000 or so pro-communist Afghan troops, were present in Afghanistan. The Soviet occupation resulted in a mass exodus of over 5 million Afghans that moved into [[refugee camp]]s in neighboring Pakistan, Iran and other countries. More than 3 million settled in Pakistan, over a million in Iran and many others in different countries of the world. Faced with mounting international pressure and the loss of over 15,000 Soviet soldiers as a result of Mujahideen opposition forces trained by the United States, Pakistan, and other foreign governments, the Soviets withdrew ten years later, in 1989.
{{further|[[Soviet war in Afghanistan]]}}

The Soviet withdrawal from the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] was seen as an ideological victory in the US, which had backed the Mujahideen through three US presidential administrations in order to counter Soviet influence in the vicinity of the oil-rich [[Persian Gulf]]. Following the removal of the Soviet forces in 1989, the US and its allies lost interest in Afghanistan and did little to help rebuild the war-ravaged country or influence events there. The [[USSR]] continued to support President [[Najibullah]] (formerly the head of the secret service, ''[[KHAD]]'') until his downfall in 1992. However, the absence of the Soviet forces resulted in the downfall of the pro-communist government as it steadily lost ground to the guerrilla forces.<ref name=Columbia:Afghanistan:History>Columbia Encyclopedia - ''Afghanistan: History''...[http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0856490.html Link]</ref> [[Image:Evstafiev-afghan-apc-passes-russian.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Soviet troops withdrawing from Afghanistan in 1988.]]

The result of the fighting was that the vast majority of the elites and intellectuals had escaped to take refuge abroad, a dangerous leadership vacuum thereby coming into existence. Fighting continued among the various Mujahideen factions, eventually giving rise to a state of warlordism. The most serious fighting during this growing civil conflict occurred in 1994, when over 10,000 people were killed in Kabul. The chaos and corruption that dominated post-Soviet Afghanistan in turn spawned the rise of the [[Taliban]], who were mostly [[Pashtun]]s from the [[Helmand province|Helmand]] and [[Kandahar province|Kandahar]] region. 

The Taliban developed as a politico-religious force, and eventually seized Kabul in 1996. By the end of 2000, the Taliban were able to capture 95% of the country, aside from the opposition ([[Afghan Northern Alliance]]) strongholds primarily found in the northeast corner of [[Badakhshan Province]]. The Taliban sought to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic ''[[Sharia|Sharia law]]'' and were later implicated as supporters of terrorists, most notably by harbouring [[Osama bin Laden]]'s [[Al-Qaeda]] network. 

During the Taliban's seven-year rule, much of the population experienced restrictions on their freedom and violations of their human rights. Women were banned from jobs, girls forbidden to attend schools or universities. Those who resisted were punished instantly. Communists were systematically eradicated and thieves were punished by amputating one of their hands or feet. On the positive side, the Taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001.<ref>Afghanistan, Opium and the Taliban [http://opioids.com/afghanistan/index.html]</ref>

[[Image:Ahmad shah massoud 3.jpg|thumb|130px|left|[[Ahmed Shah Massoud]] was a famous military commander. He fought the Soviets in the 1980s and the Taliban in the 1990s, until he was assassinated by al-Qaeda on September 9, 2001.]]
Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the United States launched [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], a military campaign to destroy the Al-Qaeda terrorist network operating in Afghanistan and overthrow their host (the Taliban government). The US made common cause with the Afghan Northern Alliance to achieve its ends.

In December 2001, major leaders from the Afghan opposition groups and diaspora met in [[Bonn]], [[Germany]], and agreed on a [[Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan)|plan]] for the formulation of a new democratic government that resulted in the inauguration of [[Hamid Karzai]], a Pashtun from the southern city of Kandahar, as Chairman of the [[Afghan Interim Authority]].

After a nationwide ''[[Loya Jirga]]'' in 2002, Karzai was chosen by the representatives to assume the title as Interim-President of Afghanistan. In 2003, the country convened a Constitutional Loya Jirga (Council of Elders) and ratified a new [[Constitution of Afghanistan|constitution]] the following year. Hamid Karzai was elected President in a nation-wide election in October 2004. Legislative elections were held in September 2005. The National Assembly &ndash; the first freely elected legislature in Afghanistan since 1973 &ndash; sat in December 2005, and was noteworthy for the inclusion of women as voters, candidates, and elected members. [[Image:Hamid Karzai 2006-09-26.jpg|thumb|190px|right|[[Hamid Karzai]] became the President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in 2004, following an election that was held in the country for the first time in history.]]

As the country continues to rebuild and recover, it is still struggling against poverty, poor [[infrastructure]], large concentration of [[land mine]]s and other unexploded ordinance on earth, as well as a huge illegal [[opium poppy|poppy]] cultivation and [[opium]] trade. Afghanistan also remains subject to occasionally violent political jockeying. The country continues to grapple with the [[Taliban insurgency]], the threat of attacks from a few remaining al-Qaeda, and instability, particularly in the north, caused by the remaining few semi-independent warlords. 

=== Latest on Afghanistan ===

The start of 2007 saw the situation in Afghanistan worsening. Taliban's growing strength led the US to consider longer tours and even an increase in troop numbers. According to a report filed by Robert Burns of Associated Press on January 16, 2007 "U.S. military officials cited new evidence that the Pakistani military, which has long-standing ties to the Taliban movement, has turned a blind eye to the incursions." Also "The number of insurgent attacks is up by 300 percent since September [2006], when the Pakistani government put into effect a peace arrangement with tribal leaders in the north Waziristan area, along Afghanistan's eastern border, a U.S. military intelligence officer told reporters." [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/16/ap/world/mainD8MMJDEO1.shtml] Opium production has also steadily increased, accounting for one-third to two-third of the country's GDP [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/15/AR2007011500967.html]. Nonetheless, Afghanistan is fairly stable politically and the general situation is still much better than in Iraq.

==Government and politics==
{{morepolitics|country=Afghanistan}}<!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series--> 
Politics in Afghanistan has historically consisted of power struggles, bloody [[coups]] and unstable transfers of power. With the exception of a [[military junta]], the country has been governed by nearly every system of government over the past century, including a [[monarchy]], [[republic]], [[theocracy]] and [[communist state]]. The constitution ratified by the [[2003 Loya jirga]] restructured the government as an [[Islamic republic]] consisting of three branches, ([[executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature]] and [[judiciary]]). 

Afghanistan is currently led by President [[Hamid Karzai]], who was elected in October 2004. The current [[National Assembly of Afghanistan|parliament]] was elected in 2005. Among the elected officials were former mujahadeen, Taliban members, communists, [[reformists]], and [[Islamic fundamentalists]]. 28% of the delegates elected were women, 3% more than the 25% minimum guaranteed under the constitution. This made Afghanistan, long known under the Taliban for its oppression of women, one of the leading countries in terms of female representation.

The [[Afghan Supreme Court|Supreme Court of Afghanistan]] is currently led by Chief Justice [[Abdul Salam Azimi]], a former university professor who had been legal advisor to the president.<ref>[http://www.e-ariana.com/ariana/eariana.nsf/allDocs/E78CB0C74F5E7142872571C90048D8BD?OpenDocument - New Supreme Court Could Mark Genuine Departure - August 13, 2006]</ref> The previous court, appointed during the time of the interim government, had been dominated by fundamentalist religious figures, including Chief Justice [[Faisal Ahmad Shinwari]]. The court had issued numerous questionable rulings, such as banning [[cable television]], seeking to ban a candidate in the 2004 presidential election and limiting the rights of women, as well as overstepping its constitutional authority by issuing rulings on subjects not yet brought before the court. The current court is seen as more moderate and led by more [[technocrat]]s than the previous court, although it has yet to issue any rulings.

=== Law Enforcement ===

Plans call for Afghanistan to have a national police force of 50,000. Although the police officially are responsible for maintaining civil order, local and regional military commanders continue to exercise control in the hinterland. Police have been accused of improper treatment and detention of prisoners. In 2003 the mandate of the International Security Assistance Force, now under command of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) was extended and expanded beyond the [[Kabul]] area. However, in some areas unoccupied by those forces, local militias maintain control. In many areas, crimes have gone uninvestigated because of insufficient police and/or communications. Troops of the Afghan National Army have been sent to quell fighting in some regions lacking police protection.<ref name="LOCprof">Text used in this cited section originally came from: [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf Afghanistan (Feb 2005) profile] from the [[Library of Congress Country Studies]] project.</ref>

==Economy==
{{POV check}}
{{main|Economy of Afghanistan}}
[[Image:Kabul Trade Center.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A [[financial institution|business center]] in Kabul.]]

Afghanistan is an extremely impoverished country, one of the world's poorest and least developed nations. Two-thirds of the population lives on less than [[US Dollar|US]] 2 dollars a day. The economy has suffered greatly from the recent political and military unrest since the 1979 Soviet invasion and subsequent conflicts, while severe drought added to the nation's difficulties in 1998-2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2005-03/2005-03-28-voa53.cfm|title=Poor Afghanistan|last=Morales|first=Victor|publisher=Voice of America|date=2005-03-28|accessdate=2006-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3582023.stm|last=North|first=Andrew|title=Why Afghanistan wants $27.6bn|publisher=BBC News|date=2004-03-30|accessdate=2006-09-10}}</ref> 

The economically active population in 2002 was about 11 million (out of a total of an estimated 29 million). While there are no official unemployment rate estimates available, it is evident that it is high. The number of non-skilled young people is estimated at 3 million, which is likely to increase by some 300,000 per annum.<ref name=Fujimura>[http://www.adbi.org/research-policy-brief/2004/10/15/698.afghan.economy.after.election/ Fujimura, Manabu (2004) "Afghan Economy After the Election", Asian Development Bank Institute]</ref>

As much as one-third of Afghanistan's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including [[opium]] and its two derivatives, [[morphine]] and [[heroin]], as well as [[hashish]] production.<ref name="CIA">CIA World Factbook - ''Afghanistan''...[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/af.html Link]</ref>

On a positive note, international efforts to rebuild Afghanistan led to the formation of the [[Afghan Interim Authority]] (AIA) as a result of the December 2001 [[Bonn]] Agreement, and later addressed at the [[Tokyo]] Donors Conference for Afghan Reconstruction in 2002, where 4.5 billion US dollars were committed in a trust fund to be administered by the [[World Bank Group]]. Another 4 billion US dollars were committed in 2004 followed by 10.5 billion in early 2006 at the [[London Conference]].<ref>Irin News.org - Afghanistan: ''Government to have greater control over aid pledged in London''...[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=51510&SelectRegion=Asia&SelectCountry=AFGHANISTAN Link]</ref> Priority areas for reconstruction include the rebuilding of the educational system, health, and sanitation facilities, enhancement of administrative capacity, the development of the agricultural sector, and the rebuilding of road, energy, and telecommunication links.

According to a 2004 report by the [[Asian Development Bank]], the present reconstruction effort is two-pronged: first it focuses on rebuilding critical physical infrastructure, and second, on building modern public sector institutions from the remnants of Soviet style planning to ones that promote market-led development.<ref name=Fujimura>[http://www.adbi.org/research-policy-brief/2004/10/15/698.afghan.economy.after.election/ Fujimura, Manabu (2004) "Afghan Economy After the Election", Asian Development Bank Institute]</ref> In 2006, two US companies, Black & Veatch and the [[Louis Berger Group]], have won a US 1.4 billion dollar contract to rebuild roads, power lines and water supply systems of Afghanistan.<ref>The Kansas City Star - ''Midday Business Report: Black & Veatch unit gains piece of Afghan contract''...[http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/15556499.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jsp Link]</ref>

One of the main drivers for the current economic recovery is the return of over 4 million refugees from neighbouring countries and the West, who brought with them fresh energy, entrepreneurship and wealth-creating skills as well as much needed funds to [http://www.doingbusiness.org/ExploreTopics/StartingBusiness/MoreDetails.aspx?economyid=2 start up businesses]. What is also helping is the estimated US 2-3 billion dollars in international assistance every year, the partial recovery of the agricultural sector, and the reestablishment of market institutions. Private developments are also beginning to get underway. In 2006, a Dubai-based Afghan family opened a $25 million [[Coca Cola]] bottling plant in Afghanistan.<ref>Contra Costa Times - ''Coca-Cola opens plant in Afghanistan''...[http://www.contracostatimes.com/mld/cctimes/business/15498245.htm link]</ref>
[[Image:Kabul City Center.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Kabul City Center]]]]

While the country's current account deficit is largely financed with the donor money, only a small portion &ndash; about 15% &ndash; is provided directly to the government budget. The rest is provided to non-budgetary expenditure and donor-designated projects through the [[United Nations]] system and [[non-governmental organization]]s. The government had a central budget of only $350 million in 2003 and an estimated $550 million in 2004. The country's foreign exchange reserves totals about $500 million. Revenue is mostly generated through customs, as income and corporate tax bases are negligible.

Inflation had been a major problem until 2002. However, the depreciation of the Afghani in 2002 after the introduction of the new notes (which replaced 1,000 old Afghani by 1 new Afghani) coupled with the relative stability compared to previous periods has helped prices to stabilize and even decrease between December 2002 and February 2003, reflecting the turnaround appreciation of the new Afghani currency. Since then, the index has indicated stability, with a moderate increase toward late 2003.<ref name="Fujimura">[http://www.adbi.org/research-policy-brief/2004/10/15/698.afghan.economy.after.election/ Fujimura, Manabu (2004) "Afghan Economy After the Election", Asian Development Bank Institute]</ref>

The Afghan government and international donors seem to remain committed to improving access to basic necessities, infrastructure development, education, housing and economic reform. The central government is also focusing on improved revenue collection and public sector expenditure discipline. The rebuilding of the financial sector seems to have been so far successful. Money can now be transferred in and out of the country via official banking channels. Since 2003, over fourteen new banks have opened in the country, including [[Da Afghanistan Bank]], [[Standard Chartered Bank]], [[Afghanistan International Bank]], [http://www.kabulbank.af/ Kabul Bank], [http://www.azizibank.com/ Azizi Bank], First MicroFinanceBank, and others. A new law on private investment provides three to seven-year [[tax holiday]]s to eligible companies and a four-year exemption from exports [[tariff]]s and duties.

[[Image:KABULCITYMAP.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The plan for Kabul's nine billion dollar future modern urban development project, the [[City of Light Development]].]]

Some private investment projects, backed with national support, are also beginning to pick up steam in Afghanistan. An initial concept design called the [[City of Light Development]], envisioned by Dr. [[Hisham N. Ashkouri]], Prinicpal of [[ARCADD, Inc.]] for the development and the implementation of a privately based investment enterprise has been proposed for multi-function commercial, historic and cultural development within the limits of the Old City of Kabul along the Southern side of the Kabul River and along Jade Meywand Avenue,<ref>Kabul - City of Light Project...[http://www.cityoflight-kabul.com/p11.htm link]</ref> revitalizing some of the most commercial and historic districts in the City of Kabul, which contains numerous historic mosques and shrines as well as viable commercial activities among war damaged buildings. Also incorporated in the design is a new complex for the [[Afghan National Museum]].  

While these improvements will help rebuild a strong basis for the nation in the future, for now, half the population continues to suffer from insufficient food, clothing, housing, and other problems exacerbated by military operations and political uncertainties. The government is not strong enough to collect customs duties from all the provinces due to the power of the warlords. Fraud is widespread and "corruption is rife within many Afghan government organs.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4494134 The Economist magazine, UK, October 2005]</ref>

The overall good news is the country has potential to quickly come out of poverty and become an economically stable country. This is due to many reports showing that the country has possession of mass amounts of high demand natural resources and minerals. According to the US Geological Survey and the Afghan Ministry of Mines and Industry, Afghanistan may be possessing up to 36 trillion cubic feet of [[natural gas]], 3.6 billion barrels of [[petroleum]] and up to 1,325 million barrels of [[natural gas liquids]]. This could mark the turning point in Afghanistan’s reconstruction efforts. Energy exports could generate the revenue that Afghan officials need to modernize the country’s infrastructure and expand economic opportunities for the beleaguered and fractious population.<ref name="Eurasianet">Eurasianet.org - Eurasia Insight - ''Afghanistan’s Energy Future and its Potential Implications''...

The population of Afghanistan is divided into a wide variety of ethnic groups.

===Largest cities===
{{seealso|List of cities in Afghanistan|Places in Afghanistan}}
The only city in Afghanistan with over one million residents is its capital, Kabul. The other major cities in the country are, in order of population size, [[Kandahar]], [[Herat]], [[Mazari Sharif]], [[Jalalabad]], [[Ghazni]] and [[Kunduz]].

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Afghanistan}}
[[Image:Jam Minaret decoration.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Minaret of Jam]].]]
Afghans display pride in their religion, country, ancestry, and above all, their independence. Like other highlanders, Afghans are regarded with mingled apprehension and condescension, for their high regard for personal honor, for their [[clan]] loyalty and for their readiness to carry and use arms to settle disputes.<ref name="Heathcote">Heathcote, Tony (1980, 2003) "The Afghan Wars 1839 - 1919", Sellmount Staplehurst</ref> As clan warfare and internecine feuding has been one of their chief occupations since time immemorial, this individualistic trait has made it difficult for foreign invaders to hold the region.

Afghanistan has a complex history that has survived either in its current cultures or in the form of various languages and monuments. However, many of the country's historic monuments have been damaged in recent wars. The two famous [[Buddhas of Bamyan|statues of Buddha]] in the [[Bamyan Province]] were destroyed by the Taliban, who regarded them as [[Idolatry|idolatrous]]. Other famous sites include the very cities of [[Kandahar]], [[Herat]], [[Ghazni]] and [[Balkh]]. The Minaret of Jam, in the [[Hari Rud]] valley, is a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage site]]. The cloak worn by [[Muhammad]] is stored inside the famous Khalka Sharifa in Kandahar City.

The people of Afghanistan are prominent horsemen as the national [[sport]] is [[Buzkashi]], similar to [[polo]], but instead which a [[goat]] carcass is used instead of a ball. [[Afghan hound]]s (a type of running [[dog]]) also originated from Afghanistan.

Although literacy levels are very low, classic [[Persian literature|Persian poetry]] plays a very important role in Afghan culture. Poetry has always been one of the major educational pillars in [[Iran]] and Afghanistan, to the level that it has integrated itself into culture. Persian culture has, and continues to, exert a great influence over Afghan culture. Private poetry competition events known as “musha’era” are quite common even among ordinary people. Almost every home owns one or more poetry collection of some sort, even if it is not read often.

The eastern dialects of the Persian language are popularly known as "[[Dari (Afghanistan)|Dari]]". The name itself derives from "Pārsī-e Darbārī", meaning ''Persian of the royal courts''. The ancient term ''Darī'' &ndash; one of the original names of the Persian language &ndash; was revived in the Afghan constitution of 1964, and was intended ''"to signify that Afghans consider their country the cradle of the language.  Hence, the name ''Fārsī'', the language of [[Fars|Fārs]], is strictly avoided. With this point in mind, we can consider the development of Dari or Persian literature in the political entity known as Afghanistan."''<ref>R. Farhādī, ''"Modern literature of Afghanistan"'', [[Encyclopaedia Iranica]], xii, Online Edition, ([http://www.iranica.com/newsite/search/searchpdf.isc?ReqStrPDFPath=/home/iranica/public_html/newsite/pdfarticles/v1_articles/afghanistan/literature&OptStrLogFile=/home/iranica/public_html/newsite/logs/pdfdownload.html LINK])</ref> 

Many of the famous [[List of Persian poets and authors|Persian poets]] of the tenth to fifteenth centuries stem from [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] where is now known as Afghanistan. They were mostly also scholars in many disciplines like languages, natural sciences, medicine, religion and astronomy. 

* [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Mawlānā Rumi]], who was born and educated in [[Balkh]] in the thirteenth century and moved to [[Konya]] in modern-day [[Turkey]]
* [[Rabi'a Balkhi]] (the first poetess in the History of Persian Poetry, tenth century, native of Balkh)
* [[Abu Mansur Daqiqi|Daqiqi Balkhi]] (10th century, native of [[Balkh]])
* [[Farrukhi Sistani]] (10th century, the [[Ghaznavids]] royal poet)
* [[Unsuri|Unsuri Balkhi]] (a 10th/11th century poet, native of Balkh)
* [[Khwaja Abdullah Ansari]] (11th century, from [[Herat]])
* [[Anvari]] (12th century, lived and died in Balkh)
* [[Sanaayi|Sanā'ī Ghaznawi]] (twelfth century, native of [[Ghazni]]) 	 
* [[Jami|Jāmī of Herāt]] (fifteenth century, native of Herat in western Afghanistan), and his nephew [[Abdullah Hatifi]] Herawi, a well-known poet
* [[Alisher Navoi|Alī Sher Navā'ī,]] (fifteenth century, Herat).

Most of these individuals were of Persian ([[Tajiks|Tājīk]]) ethnicity who still form the second-largest ethnic group in Afghanistan. Also, some of the contemporary Persian language poets and writers, who are relatively well-known in Persian-speaking world, include [[Ustad Betab]], [[Qari Abdullah]], [[Khalilollah Khalili|Khalilullah Khalili]],<ref>[http://www.afghanmagazine.com/arts/khalili/khalili.html Afghanmagazine.com - Ustad Khalilullah Khalili - 1997]</ref> Sufi Ghulam Nabi Ashqari,<ref>[http://www.afghanmagazine.com/jan2000/music/kharaabat/ Afghanmagazine.com - Kharaabat - by Yousef Kohzad - 2000]</ref> [[Qahar Asey]], [[Parwin Pazwak]] and others. In 2003, Khaled Hosseini published The Kiterunner which though fiction, captured much of the history, politics and culture experienced in Afghanistan from the 1930s to present day.

In addition to poets and authors, numerous [[List of Iranian scientists and scholars|Persian scientists]] have had their origins lie in where it's now called Afghanistan. Most notable was [[Avicenna]] (Abu Alī Hussein ibn Sīnā) whose father hailed from [[Balkh]]. Ibn Sīnā, who travelled to [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]] later in life to establish a medical school there, is known by some scholars as "the father of modern medicine". George Sarton called ibn Sīnā "the most famous scientist of Islam and one of the most famous of all races, places, and times." His most famous works are ''The Book of Healing'' and ''The Canon of Medicine'', also known as the Qanun. Ibn Sīnā's story even found way to the contemporary English literature through [[Noah Gordon]]'s ''[[The Physician]]'', now published in many languages. Moreover, according to [[Ibn al-Nadim]], [[Al-Farabi]], a well-known Philosopher and Scientist, was from the [[Faryab Province]] of Afghanistan, .

Before the Taliban gained power, the city of Kabul was home to many musicians who were masters of both traditional and modern Afghan music, especially during the [[Nauroz]]-celebration. Kabul in the middle part of the twentieth century has been likened to [[Vienna]] during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

The tribal system, which orders the life of most people outside metropolitan areas, is potent in political terms. Men feel a fierce loyalty to their own tribe, such that, if called upon, they would assemble in arms under the tribal chiefs and local clan leaders (Khans). In theory, under Islamic law, every believer has an obligation to bear arms at the ruler's call ([[Ulul-Amr]]).

Heathcote considers the tribal system to be the best way of organizing large groups of people in a country that is geographically difficult, and in a society that, from a materialistic point of view, has an uncomplicated lifestyle.<ref name="Heathcote">Heathcote, Tony (1980, 2003) "The Afghan Wars 1839 - 1919", Sellmount Staplehurst</ref>

== Infrastructure ==
===Communications and technology===
Afghanistan has rapidly increased in communication technology, and has embarked on wireless companies, internet, radio stations and television channels. Afghan telecommunication companies, [[Afghan Wireless]], [[Roshan (Telecom)|Roshan]] and Areeba, have boasted increase in rapid cellular phone usage. In 2006, the Afghan Ministry of Communications has signed a [[US Dollar|US]] 64.5 million dollar agreement with a company (ZTE Corporation) on the establishment of a countrywide fibre optical cable network. This will improve telephone, internet, television and radio broadcast services throughout the country.<ref>Pajhwok Afghan News - ''Ministry signs contract with Chinese company''...[http://www.pajhwok.com/viewstory.asp?lng=eng&id=26882 Link]</ref>

Afghanistan's local television channels include:
* [[Aina TV]] 	 
* [[Ariana TV]]
* [[Ariana Afghanistan TV]]
* Lamar TV
* Shamshad TV
* [[Tolo TV]]

===Transportation===
[[Image:AfghanChildren.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Children ride in the bed of a truck in downtown [[Kabul]] (June 2003). Original photo by Peter Rimar.]]
Afghanistan's commercial airlines, [[Ariana Afghan Airlines]], now serves flights to , [[Frankfurt]], [[Dubai]] and [[Istanbul]] to and from [[Kabul]] and [[Herat]]. Afghanistan has also improved in vehicle conditions with [[Toyota]], [[Land Rover]], [[BMW]] and [[Hyundai]] dealerships all over Kabul, and a huge import of fine second-hand vehicles from [[UAE]] on display in Kandahar. Afghanistan, however, still is a long way from major modern technological advancements, but is on the fast road to that goal.

===Education===
{{main|Education in Afghanistan}}
In the spring of 2003, it was estimated that 30% of Afghanistan's 7,000 schools had been very seriously damaged during more than two decades of civil war. Only half of the schools were reported to have clean water, while fewer than an estimated 40% had adequate sanitation. Education for boys was not a priority during the Taliban regime, and girls were banished from schools outright.

As regards the poverty and violence of their surroundings, a study in 2002 by the [[Save the Children Fund]] said Afghan children were resilient and courageous. The study credited the strong institutions of family and community.

As of 2006, more than four million male and female students are enrolled in schools throughout the country. Primary education is totally free and available for all boys and girls.

Literacy of the entire population is estimated at 36%, the male literacy rate is 51% and female literacy is 21%. Up to now there are 9,000 schools in the country.

Another aspect of education that is rapidly changing in Afghanistan is the face of [[higher education]]. Following the fall of the Taliban, [[Kabul University]] was reopened to both male and female students. In 2006, the [[American University of Afghanistan]] also opened its doors, with the aim of providing a world-class, English-language, co-educational learning environment in Afghanistan. The university accepts students from Afghanistan and the neighboring countries. Construction work will soon start at the new site selected for [[Balkh University]] in Mazari Sharif. The new building for the university, including the building for the Engineering Department, would be constructed at 600 acres of land at the cost of US 250 million dollars.<ref>Pajhwok Afghan News - ''Pakistan grants $10m for Balkh University''...[http://www.pajhwok.com/viewstory.asp?lng=eng&id=28303 Link]</ref>
