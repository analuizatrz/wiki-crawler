'''''Age of Mythology''''' (commonly abbreviated as '''''AoM'''''), is a [[mythology]]-based, [[real-time strategy|real-time strategy (RTS)]] [[Personal computer game|computer game]] developed by [[Ensemble Studios]], and published by [[Microsoft Game Studios]]. It was released on [[November 1]], [[2002]] in [[North America]],<ref name="release" /> and on [[November 8]] of the same year in [[Europe]].<ref name="release" />

''Age of Mythology'' focuses less on historical accuracy than the previous games by Ensemble Studios&mdash;namely, the [[Age of Empires series|''Age of Empires'' series]]&mdash;but instead centres upon the [[mythology|myths]] and [[legend]]s of the [[Ancient]] [[Greece|Greek]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], and [[Norse mythology|Norse]] peoples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macgamer.net/games/aom/civs/|title=Age of Mythology civilizations on MacGamer.net|publisher=MacGamer.net|accessdate=2007-05-11}}</ref> Its campaign follows an [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] admiral, [[List of characters in the Age of Mythology series#Arkantos|Arkantos]], who is forced to travel through the lands of the three civilizations in the game, hunting for a man who has turned [[Poseidon]] against his homeland.<ref name=EuroGamerReview>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=4138|title= Age of Mythology review on Eurogamer, with details on plot.|accessdate=2007-05-26|publisher=Eurogamer|first=Rob|last=Fahey|published=2002-12-10}}</ref>  Age of Mythology is the first "Age of" game to utilise a 3D graphics engine, allowing rotation of the map.

Four months after its release, ''Age of Mythology'' went platinum, meaning it had sold over 1,000,000 units.<ref name=plat>[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2003/mar03/03-11platinummythologypr.mspx ''"Age of Mythology" Goes Platinum With More Than 1 Million Units Sold'']</ref> General manager for PC games at [[Microsoft]], Stuart Moulder, said that "The worldwide popularity of the entire franchise continues to grow, while the fans' excitement inspires the development team at Ensemble Studios to create more innovative games each year."<ref name=plat>[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2003/mar03/03-11platinummythologypr.mspx ''"Age of Mythology" Goes Platinum With More Than 1 Million Units Sold'']</ref>

''[[Age of Mythology: The Titans]]'', an expansion to ''Age of Mythology'', was released in [[September]] [[2004]].<ref name=TitansRelease>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/ageofmythologytitans/index.html?q=Age%20of%20Mythology:%20The%20Titans&tag=result;title;0 |title=Age of Mythology: The Titans|publisher=Gamespot|accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref> The expansion contained a new civilization; the [[Atlantis|Atlanteans]], and several new units, including the [[Titan (mythology)|titans]].  The expansion was received well by critics and fans alike, though its rating was not as high as that of the original.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Mythology:The_Titans |title=Age of Mythology:The Titans|publisher=[[English Wikipedia]]|accessdate=2007-07-18}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
Like many other [[real-time strategy]] games, the core of ''Age of Mythology'' is based on building towns, gathering resources, creating armies, and ultimately destroying enemy units and buildings, thus defeating rival towns, and civilizations. Players advance their tribe through four "Ages": starting in the [[Archaic period|Archaic Age]], the player may upgrade to the [[Classical period|Classical Age]], [[Heroism|Heroic Age]], and, finally, the [[Mythology|Mythic Age]]. Each upgrade to a latter age unlocks new units and technologies for the player, which strengthen their people. Conversely, upgrading requires a good deal of resources to be paid, and certain buildings to be built.

There are 4 major resources in ''Age of Mythology'': [[food]], [[wood]], [[gold]], and [[wiktionary:favour|favour]] (which replaces stone in previous ''Age of Empires Series'' games). The resources can be used to train units, construct buildings, and research technologies. Resources are gathered by civilian units: the Greek villager, the Norse gatherer or dwarf, and the Egyptian laborer. Food can be collected by hunting animals, gathering berries, harvesting livestock, farming, or fishing (fishing is not performed by the standard civilian unit, but by a [[fishing boat]]) Wood is gathered from chopping down trees, and gold is gathered from gold mines, or from trade. Each civilization can purchase upgrades that increase the rate of gathering these resources. Resources can be sold (for gold) or purchased (using gold) at a player’s [[market]].

===Civilizations===
There are 3 playable civilizations in ''Age of Mythology''; Greek, Egyptian, and Norse.

Each civilization has three “major gods” - well known deities such as [[Zeus]] or [[Odin]].  These are chosen at the start of the game.  Every time a player advances to the next age, a “minor god” is selected.  Minor gods are slightly less significant gods (according to history) such as [[Bast]] and [[Hel]]. Each God has its own unique technologies, myth units, and god powers (special abilities which give the player “god like” powers that can massively impede an opposition’s progress).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ensemblestudios.com/Games/AgeOfMythology/Default.aspx|title=Age of Mythology page on Ensemble Studios Website|publisher=[[Ensemble Studios]]|accessdate=2007-06-04}}</ref>

'''The Greeks''', based on the ancient [[Greeks|Greek]] civilization, are considered the most basic civilization in ''Age of Mythology'', as their gameplay aspects are almost the same as those of civilizations in previous ''Age of Empires series'' games. The Greeks gain favor by assigning villagers to pray at temples. Food, wood, and gold are also gathered by villagers. The Greeks train their military units at different buildings based on the unit’s class. Military academies are used to train [[melee]] [[infantry]], [[archery]] ranges train ranged infantry and [[stable]]s are used to train cavalry. The Greeks are the most balanced civilization in the game. Their building and units are of higher quality (health, attack, etc) however they are the most expensive. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macgamer.net/games/aom/civs/greeks.html|title=Greek Civilization on MacGamer.net|publisher=MacGamer.net|accessdate=2007-05-11}}</ref>

[[Image:Age of Mythology ingame screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|In this screenshot, an Egyptian town is being attacked by the Norse, and is defending itself using the meteor god power.]]
'''The Egyptians''' are based on the ancient Egyptian civilization who lived in the [[Nile]] River Valley in North-East [[Africa]]. The Egyptians differ from other civilizations in the ''Age of Empires'' series in that they are led by a [[pharaoh]]. The pharaoh is able to heal units, and can empower buildings, thus increasing their productivity. Labourers carrying resources to an empowered building perform their resource collection faster, technologies researched at an empowered building are research faster, and units trained there are produced faster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aom.heavengames.com/gameinfo/units/egyptian/pharaoh.htm |title=Age of Mythology Heaven Pharoah info|publisher=Age of Mythology Heaven|accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref> Players who select [[Ra]] as their major god are granted a [[priest]] (another unique Egyptian unit) who is able to empower buildings. Egyptians gain favour by building monuments to their gods. The more monuments a player has built, with the maximum being five, the faster the player will receive favor. The Egyptians' economy and defence are their strongest points. Isis is considered the best Egyptian God. Egyptian Villagers are the weakest and build/gather the slowest. They are, however, able to build certain buildings for free and are extremely efficient with the aid of their pharoahs and sheer numbers. The Egyptian barracks only produce infantry and archers, with unique qualities, and as such cavalry can only be built during and after the Heroic Age. Set, and Egyptian God, is very popular with begginers despite the fact that they are unable to use him well. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macgamer.net/games/aom/civs/egyptians.html|title=Egyptian Civilization on MacGamer.net|publisher=MacGamer.net|accessdate=2007-05-11}}</ref>

'''The Norse''' are based on the ancient [[Scandinavia]]n people. They greatly differ from civilizations in other ''Age of Empires series'' games. Norse gatherers are unable to construct buildings, that job is done by their infantry units.<Ref>{{ cite web |url=http://www.apple.com/games/articles/2003/09/ageofmythology/|title= pple Games page on Age of Mythology|accessdate=2007-07-04|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]}}</ref>  The Norse also have a special resource gatherer, the [[dwarf]], who gathers gold at a greater rate. Players who select [[Thor]] as their major god are granted 2 dwarfs at the start instead of gatherers, and gather food and wood more proficiently than non-Thor dwarves (though NOT as fast as gatherers). While the other civilizations gain favor from praying and building monuments, the Norse gain favor by fighting in any manner (even killing animals). They also gain small amounts of favor for having large numbers of Hersirs alive. The Norse are considered the most aggressive civilization in the game.<ref name="gamershell">{{cite web | last = Burrell | first = M. | title = Age of Mythology Review - GamersHell.com | publisher = GamersHell.com | url = http://www.gamershell.com/pc/age_of_mythology/review.html | accessdate = 2007-04-20 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macgamer.net/games/aom/civs/norse.html|title=Norse Civilization on MacGamer.net|publisher=MacGamer.net|accessdate=2007-05-11}}</ref>

===Gods===
''Age of Mythology’s'' gameplay differs from that of other [[real-time strategy]] games in that players are able to choose gods for their civilization to follow.
Before the game starts, the player must choose a major god based on their civilizations. Greek players can choose from [[Zeus]], [[Poseidon]], and [[Hades]]. Egyptian players choose from [[Set]], [[Isis]], and [[Ra]]. Norse players can choose between [[Odin]], [[Thor]], and [[Loki]].  Each major god possesses a major god power, which is a powerful piece of “magic” the player can summon once in the game. Examples include Zeus’ Bolt, which does several thousand hit points of damage to the unit it is targeted upon, and Loki’s Spy, which allows a player to see the line of sight of an enemy unit. All major gods have one unique technology that can be researched. For example, players choosing Hades are able to research “Vaults of Erebus,” which provides a small but constant trickle of gold.

Every time a player advances to the next age, they must choose between one of two minor gods. Minor gods give the player several new technologies, a new myth unit, and a more powerful god power. Examples of Minor Gods include [[Dionysus]] and [[Bast]].

====Favor====
The favor system is a unique element in Age of Mythology which is based upon the ancient beliefs that the gods could greatly influence everyday life. Favor is gained by "pleasing the gods" and allows players to train myth units and research certain technologies. '''Greek''' players earn favor by praying at [[temple]]s with villagers. '''Egyptian''' players earn favor by building [[monument]]s. '''Norse''' players earn favor by fighting, or by possessing Hersirs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aom.heavengames.com/gameinfo/units/norse/hersir.htm|title=Age of Mythology Heaven Hersir info|publisher=Age of Mythology Heaven|accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref> Players can posses up to 100 units of favor, unless they have chosen Zeus as their major god, in which case they can possess 200 and start with 20.

===Units===
The bulk of each civilization’s forces are made of ordinary human soldiers. Each civilization has a finite number of "population slots," that can be upgraded by building more houses and Town Centers. Each unit takes up a different number of population slots; civilians take one, whilst some myth units can take up to five. Most units can be upgraded through research (such as faster gathering for villagers, stronger armor for military units or better building structure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aom.heavengames.com/gameinfo/units|title= Age of Mythology Heaven Unit Guide|publisher=Age of Mythology Heaven|accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref>

[[Infantry]] units, such as [[huskarl]]s and [[hoplite]]s, attack using hand to hand combat, with weapons such as swords and axes, as well as shields. The [[Francisca|throwing axeman]] is considered infantry even though it has a ranged attack. Infantry generally gain attack bonuses against cavalry.

[[Archery|Archers]] are units that are able to attack at long range with pierce damage, and do well against infantry, who have low pierce armour.  Examples include the [[Toxotes]] and [[Slinger]].

[[Cavalry]] is the name given to all units on horseback that can’t fire at long range, but can only fight hand to hand. In ''Age of Mythology'', most cavalry receive an attack bonus against archers. [[Chariot]]s and [[Elephant|war elephants]] are examples of cavalry.

There are two main types of [[siege]] weapons in ''Age of Mythology'': ranged and non ranged. All siege weapons inflict crush damage, meaning that all are able to inflict damage to an area wider then the unit they targeted.

[[Catapult]]s are an example of ranged siege weaponry. They are able to fire small stones a long distance, doing large amounts of damage to buildings, as well as crush damage to anything near the building.

[[Battering ram]]s are non ranged siege weapons, so they knock buildings down with their large moving beam. To do this, they must get close to the building, risking attack. Battering rams inflict smaller amounts of crush damage.

[[Naval]] units are also present in ''Age of Mythology'', but are not as prominent as in other ''Age of Empires series'' games. Fishing boats are used to gather food from fishing holes. Egyptian fishing boats are also capable of constructing certain buildings when near the shore.

Warships are classified as arrow ships, ramming ships, or siege ships. Arrow ships are similar to Galleys in previous ''Age of Empires series'' games, and receive attack bonuses against hammer ships. Hammer ships attack other ships in melee, using a large hammer on the ship’s hull. These ships receive an attack bonus against siege ships. Siege ships attack at a very long range, with missiles similar to those used by [[Helipolis|helipoli]]. They receive an attack bonus against arrow ships and buildings.

In ''Age of Mythology'', myth units generally have special abilities that human soldiers do not possess (such as [[flight]] or [[Petrifaction|petrification]]). In addition to normal resources, myth units require payment of favor before they can be trained. All myth units are trained at the player’s [[temple]].<ref name="gamespotreview>{{cite web|url=http://au.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/ageofmythology/review.html|title=Gamespot review on Age of Mythology|publisher=[[Gamespot]]|accessdate=2007-06-04|first=Greg|last=Kasavin|date=2002-11-02}}</ref> Myth units do well against  human units, but have a negative damage multiplier against heroes, who are normally unaffected by their special abilities. Examples of myth units are [[minotaur]]s, [[Khepri|scarabs]], and [[valkyrie]]s.

Heroes in ''Age of Mythology'' are very effective against myth units, but are weak against human soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aom.heavengames.com/gameinfo/units/greek/hero|title= Age of Mythology Heaven Hero Info|publisher=Age of Mythology Heaven|accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref> They can also pick up relics. When a hero returns a relic to the player’s temple, the player will be granted an economic or military bonus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aom.heavengames.com/gameinfo/relics|title= Relics page on Age of Mythology Heaven|accessdate=2007-05-04|publisher=Age of Mythology Heaven}}</ref>

In random map games, heroes can be killed like all other units. However, in the campaign, important [[List of characters in the Age of Mythology series|characters]] will not die. Instead, they will lie at the spot where they ran out of hit points until an ally unit enters the vicinity.

===Buildings===
[[Image:AoMGreekScreenie.jpg|thumb|right|This ''Age of Mythology'' screenshot shows a Greek player shortly after the start of a random map game.  The Town Centre can be seen on the left, 3 villagers in the center, and a scout moving south.  There also two sentry towers visible.]]
Buildings are used for a variety of purposes in ''Age of Mythology''. Town Centers are the most important buildings in the game. They serve as drop off points for resources, and can shoot arrows, garrison units inside them, and train civilian units. Building upgrades and age advancements are also researched there. A single Town Center provides 15 population slots (except when a player's Major God is Isis, in which case it provides 18). In order to gain more population slots, either more Town Centers or [[house]]s must be built.<ref name=buildings>{{cite web|url=http://www.macgamer.net/games/aom/buildings.html|title= Buildings on MacGamer.net|publisher=MacGamer.net|accessdate=2007-06-04}}</ref>

In ''Age of Mythology'', all military units are trained at specific buildings. Military units are created in specific buildings, corresponding to their combat type; Greek archers are trained in archery ranges, Egyptian soldiers are trained at the barrack, etc. Myth units are created at Temples.<ref name="gamespotreview>{{cite web|url=http://au.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/ageofmythology/review.html|title=Gamespot review on Age of Mythology|publisher=[[Gamespot]]|accessdate=2007-06-04|first=Greg|last=Kasavin|date=2002-11-02}}</ref> All sea units are created in Docks.

[[Wall]]s and [[Guard Tower|towers]] are defensive fortifications, and a [[fortress]] is a fortified building which can train special units, such as siege weapons and heroes.<ref name=buildings>{{cite web|url=http://www.macgamer.net/games/aom/buildings.html|title= Buildings on MacGamer.net|publisher=MacGamer.net|accessdate=2007-06-04}}</ref>

[[Farm]]s are used to produce food, which can then be collected by civilian units. Food is then taken to the Granary or Town Centre, where it is deposited. Wood can be deposited at the Lumber Camp, and gold at the Mining Camp.<ref name=buildings>{{cite web|url=http://www.macgamer.net/games/aom/buildings.html|title= Buildings on MacGamer.net|publisher=MacGamer.net|accessdate=2007-06-04}}</ref> Markets can train trade caravans, which then travel between the market and a Town Centre, and produce a set amount of gold at the end of each journey.

A [[Monument|Wonder]] is a large building that represents an architectural achievement of the civilization. In certain game modes, once a player builds a wonder, a ten minute countdown begins. If the wonder is still standing after the countdown ends, the player who built the wonder wins.

==Campaign==
Unlike the campaign modes in [[Age of Empires]] and [[Age of Empires II]], Age of Mythology only has one central [[Military campaign|campaign]] that tells a long story, as opposed to the short unrelated campaigns in its predecessors.

Age of Mythology’s campaign is entitled ''Fall of the Trident'', and tells the story of [[List of characters in the Age of Mythology series#Arkantos|Arkantos]], an [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] admiral who is sent on a quest with the goal of regaining favour from [[Poseidon]], God of the Atlantean people.<ref name=EuroGamerReview>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=4138|title= Age of Mythology review on Eurogamer, with details on plot.|accessdate=2007-05-26|publisher=Eurogamer|first=Rob|last=Fahey|published=2002-12-10}}</ref>

Arkantos’ quest takes him to the Trojan War, where he meets [[List of characters in the Age of Mythology series#Ajax|Ajax]], [[List of characters in the Age of Mythology series#Agamemnon|Agamemnon]], and [[List of characters in the Age of Mythology series#Odysseus|Odysseus]].  After winning the war, he continues in his travels, and meets [[List of characters in the Age of Mythology series#Chiron|Chiron]].  Chiron advises him to follow [[List of characters in the Age of Mythology series#Gargarensis|Gargarensis]], a follower of [[Poseidon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macgamer.net/games/aom/overview.html|title= Age of Mythology overview on MacGamer.net|accessdate=2007-05-26|publisher=MacGamer.net}}</ref>  Arkantos, Ajax, and Chiron travel through the [[Erebus|underworld]] in their search for Gargarensis, and end up in [[Egypt]].

In Egypt, Arkantos meets [[List of characters in the Age of Mythology series#Amanra|Amanra]], who asks for his assistance in domestic issues.  He obliges, and assists her in piecing together the broken [[demigod]] [[Osiris]], before moving north, still in search of Gargarensis.<ref name="gamespotreview">{{cite web|url=http://au.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/ageofmythology/review.html?page=3|title=Age of Mythology review (campaign) on Gamespot|publisher=[[Gamespot]]|accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> While in Egypt, Arkantos learns the true story about Gargarensis--he hopes to gain immortality by freeing the Titan Kronos from Tartarus.

In the Norse lands, Arkantos meets [[List of characters in the Age of Mythology series#Reginleif|Reginleif]], and together they attempt to prevent the [[Ragnarok]] from taking place.  They encounter Gargarensis again, and he traps them in a small valley with no escapes.  In this valley, they must survive onslaughts from Gargarensis’ forces, and wait for aid from Odysseus.<ref name="IGN">{{cite web|url=http://au.pc.ign.com/articles/376/376253p1.html|title= IGN Review|accessdate=2007-05-11|publisher=[[IGN]]|published=2002-11-04|first=Steve|last=Butts}}</ref>

Whilst the heroes are fighting Gargarensis’ forces, he establishes himself in Atlantis, locking up its former leaders.  Towards the end of the campaign, Arkantos and his allies march on Atlantis, and [[Zeus]] bestows his blessing upon Arkantos, giving him the power to defeat Poseidon and Gargarensis.  After killing Poseidon’s living statue, Arkantos dies, and is immortalised by [[Athena]].

==Development==
Following the announcement of the game for [[September]] [[2002]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamezone.com/news/12_17_01_12_32PM.htm|title=Age of Mythology announced|publisher=GameZone|accessdate=2007-04-27|date=2004-12-17}}</ref> a [[Game demo|trial]] version was released to the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aom.heavengames.com/dl/demo|title=Age of Mythology Trial|publisher=Age of Mythology Heaven|accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref>  This contained a shortened version of the [[Age of Mythology#Campaign|campaign]] (5 scenarios) and 2 random maps.  In the trial version, the player could select any of the nine [[#Gods|gods]].

''Age of Mythology'' underwent a large amount of play testing during its developmental phase, as Ensemble Studios attempted to create a more balanced and competitive game then its predecessors.  Greg T. Smith commented that one of the reasons ''Age of Mythology'' is so popular is because the development team spent many hours working on the game through active testing, rather then just taking advice from a "faceless drone in another building."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/devdiary/september02/aom3/|last=Street|first=Greg T.|title=Age of Mythology: Volume III|accessdate=2007-04-29|date=2002-09-05|publisher=GameSpy}}</ref> 

There was much debate during ''Age of Mythology'''s construction concerning the unbalanced nature of god powers, and how to make them more balanced, whilst still leaving an element of fun in them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/devdiary/august02/aom2/|title=Age of Mythology: Volume II|publisher=GameSpy|accessdate=2007-04-29|last=Street|first= Greg T.|date=2002-08-21}}</ref> It was concluded that the best way to make it fair for everyone was to limit the use of god powers to one a game.

On [[September 30]], [[2003]], [[Ensemble Studios]] released an expansion to ''Age of Mythology'', dubbed ''[[Age of Mythology: The Titans]]''.<ref name=TitansRelease>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/ageofmythologytitans/index.html?q=Age%20of%20Mythology:%20The%20Titans&tag=result;title;0 |title=Age of Mythology: The Titans|publisher=Gamespot|accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref>  It contains a new civilization, the Atlanteans, as well as new units and a new mythological race, the [[Titan (mythology)|titans]].

==Reception==
''Age of Mythology'' was well-received by the public, reaching an estimated 1 million units sold within five months of its release.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = Video-games-survey.com | title = Video Game Software Sales Estimates | url = http://www.video-games-survey.com/software.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-21}}</ref>

The game was nominated for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences' Interactive Achievement Awards  for computer game of the year,<ref>[http://www.interactive.org/awards.php?winners&year=2003&cat=200302#200302 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards - PC Game of the Year]</ref> and strategy computer game of the year.<ref>[http://www.interactive.org/awards.php?winners&year=2003&cat=200322#200322 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards - PC Strategy Game of the Year]</ref>

''Age of Mythology'' received an average score of 89 (out of 100) on [[Metacritic]], ranking it as the 71<sup>st</sup> highest-rated computer game on the site.<ref name="metacritic">{{cite web | title = Age of Mythology (pc: 2002): Reviews | publisher = [[Metacritic]] | url = http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/ageofmythology | accessdate = 2007-04-20 }}</ref> The game received a score of 9.3 (Outstanding) on [[IGN]]<ref name="IGN" /> and a score of 9.2 (Superb) on [[GameSpot]].<ref name="gamespotreview" /> Review website Netjak gave ''Age of Mythology'' a score of 9.3, praising it as being "simply divine".<ref name="netjak">{{cite web | last = Lubitz | title = Age of Mythology - PC | publisher = Netjak | url = http://www.netjak.com/Reviews/windows/aom.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-20 }}</ref>

However, other critics complained of the game's similarity to its predecessors. In their review of the game, [[Game-Revolution]] stated that "[the] gameplay has been passed down from generation to generation for many, many years," and that nothing much had changed between ''Age of Mythology'' and ''[[Age of Empires II]]'' or ''[[Age of Empires]]''<ref name="gamerevolution">{{cite web | last = Ferris | first = Duke | title = Game Revolution PC Review Page - Age of Mythology | publisher = [[Game Revolution]] | url = http://www.gamerevolution.com/oldsite/games/pc/strategy/age_of_mythology.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-20 }}</ref> Review website FiringSquad stated in their review that ''Age of Mythology’s'' campaign was exceedingly long, but that the quality storyline and gameplay compensated for that.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firingsquad.com/games/aomreview/page4.asp|title= Age of Mythology Campaign review on FiringSquad|accessdate=2007-05-26|publisher=Firing Squad}}</ref>
