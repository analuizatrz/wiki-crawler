'''Law''' has been defined as a "system of rules"<ref name="hhc">{{cite book |last=Hart |first=H.L.A. |authorlink=H.L.A.

The numerous ways law might be thought of reflects the numerous ways law comes into everyone's lives. [[Contract law]] governs everything from buying a bus ticket, to obligations in the workplace. When buying or renting a house, [[property law]] defines people's rights and duties towards the bank, or landlord. When earning pensions, [[trust law]] protects savings. [[Tort]] law allows claims for compensation when someone or their property is [[harm principle|harmed]]. But if the harm is criminalised, and the act is [[Intention (criminal)|intentional]], then [[criminal law]] ensures that the perpetrator is removed from society. Society itself is built upon law. [[Constitutional law]] provides a framework for making new laws, protecting people's [[human rights]] and [[election|electing]] political representatives. [[Administrative law]] allows ordinary citizens to challenge the way government bodies exercise their power. Between different societies, [[Law#International law|international law]] builds bridges, so that people everywhere can lead better lives. "The [[rule of law]]," wrote the philosopher [[Aristotle]] in 350BC, "is better than the rule of any individual."<ref>[[Aristotle]] (c.350BC) [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/tgovt10.txt ''Politics: A Treatise on Government''] Book 3, Ch. XVI n.b. this translation reads, "it is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens"</ref>

The study of law raises important questions about [[Egalitarianism|equality]], [[fairness]] and [[justice]]. This is not always simple. "In its majestic equality," said the author [[Anatole France]] in 1894, "the law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets and steal loaves of bread."<ref>[[Anatole France|France, Anatole]] (1894) ''The Red Lily'' (''Le lys rouge'') n.b. the original French is, "La loi, dans un grand souci d'égalité, interdit aux riches comme aux pauvres
de coucher sous les ponts, de mendier dans les rues et de voler du pain."</ref> Every [[Legal systems of the world|legal system]] elaborates legal rights and responsibilities in different ways. Most countries have a codified system of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] which is regularly updated by governments. Many others use [[common law]] which develops through judicial precedent. Small numbers of countries still base their law on [[religious law|religious texts]]. But in all places there is a rich [[legal history|history]] to law, with deep [[philosophy of law|philosophical]] ideas underpinning it. Law raises pressing [[economic analysis of law|economic]] issues, just as intense [[politics|political]] battles are fought to mould law throughout its [[Law#Legal institutions|institutions]]. [[Legal profession|Professionals]] are usually trained to give people [[solicitor|advice]] about their legal rights and duties and [[barrister|represent]] them in [[court]]. But despite the complexity, law is a highly rewarding study. The noun ''law'' derives from the late [[Old English language|Old English]] ''lagu'', meaning something laid down or fixed <ref>see [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=law&searchmode=none Etymonline Dictionary]</ref> and the adjective ''legal'' comes from the Latin word ''lex''.<ref>see [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/legal Mirriam-Webster's Dictionary]</ref>

==Legal subjects==
All legal systems deal with similar issues that recur throughout society, although different categories and names may be given. Moreover, there are certain core subjects, that students are required to learn in order to practise law. For example, in England these are [[criminal law]], [[contract]], [[tort]], [[property law]], [[trusts|equity and trusts]], [[constitutional law|constitutional]] and [[administrative law]] and [[European Union law|European Community Law]]. Sometimes people distinguish "[[public law]]", which relates closely to the [[state]] (including constitutional, administrative and criminal law), from "[[private law]]", which can include contract, tort, property and many further disciplines. In [[civil law]] systems contract and tort would fall under a general [[law of obligations]] and trusts law is dealt with under statutory regimes or [[Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition|international conventions]]. Outside Europe, students may focus on different regional agreements, such as [[NAFTA]], [[SAFTA]], [[South American Community of Nations|CSN]], [[ASEAN]] or the [[African Union]]. But it is the unity and the things that all legal systems have in common, not the differences, that is the most remarkable feature of law in today's world.

===International law===
{{Main|Public international law|Conflict of laws|European Union law}}
[[Image:Naciones_Unidas_3.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Providing a constitution for public international law, the United Nations was conceived during World War II]]
In a global economy, law is [[globalisation|globalising]] too. International law can refer to three things, public international law, private international law or conflict of laws and the law of supranational organisations.

* '''[[Public international law]]''' concerns the relationships between sovereign nations. The [[United Nations]], founded under the [[UN Charter]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] is the most important international organisation. It was established after the failure of the [[Versailles Treaty]] and [[World War II]]. Other international agreements, like the [[Geneva Conventions]] on the conduct of war and international bodies such as the [[International Labour Organisation]], the [[World Trade Organisation]], or the [[International Monetary Fund]] also form a growing part of public international law.

* '''[[Conflict of Laws]]''' (or "private international law" in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries) concerns which jurisdiction a legal dispute between private parties should be heard in and which jurisdiction's law should be applied. Today businesses are increasingly capable of shifting [[capital]] and [[labour]] supply chains across borders, as well as trading with overseas businesses. This increases the number of disputes outside a unified legal framework and the enforceability of standard practices. Increasing numbers of businesses opt for commercial arbitration under the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention 1958]].

* '''[[European Union law]]''' is the first and only example of a [[supranationalism|supranational]] legal framework. However, given increasing global economic integration, many regional agreements, especially the [[South American Community of Nations]], are on track to follow the same model. In the EU, sovereign nations have pooled their authority through a system of [[European Court of Justice|courts]] and [[European Parliament|political institutions]]. It constitutes "a new legal order of international law"<ref>{{cite web | title = C-26/62 ''Van Gend en Loos v. Nederlanse Administratie Der Belastingen'' | url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61962J0026:EN:HTML | accessdate = 2007-01-19 }}

===Constitutional and administrative law===
{{Main|Constitutional law|Administrative law}}
[[Image:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The French [[declaration of the rights of man]]]]
Constitutional and administrative law govern the affairs of the state. [[Constitutional law]] concerns both the relationships between the [[executive]], [[legislature]] and [[judiciary]] and the [[human rights]] or [[civil liberties]] of individuals against the state. Most jurisdictions, like the [[Law of the United States|United States]] and [[Law of France|France]], have a single codified constitution, with a [[Bill of Rights]]. A few, like the [[Law of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], have no such document; in those jurisdictions the constitution is composed of [[statute]], [[case law]] and [[Constitutional conventions|convention]]. A case named ''[[Entick v. Carrington]]''<ref>''[[Entick v. Carrington]]'' (1765) 19 Howell's State Trials 1030</ref> illustrates a constitutional principle deriving from the common law. Mr Entick's house was searched and ransacked by Sherrif Carrington. When Mr Entick complained in court, Sherrif Carrington argued that a warrant from a Government minister, the [[George Montague-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax|Earl of Halifax]] was valid authority. However, there was no written statutory provision or court authority. The leading judge, [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Lord Camden]] stated that,

<blockquote>"The great end, for which men entered into society, was to secure their property. That right is preserved sacred and incommunicable in all instances, where it has not been taken away or abridged by some public law for the good of the whole... If no excuse can be found or produced, the silence of the books is an authority against the defendant, and the plaintiff must have judgment."</blockquote>

Inspired by [[Two Treatises of Government|John Locke]],<ref>[[John Locke|Locke, John]] (1690)''[[Second Treatise on Government]]'' Chapter 9, Line 124</ref> the fundamental constitutional principle is that the individual can do anything but that which is forbidden by law, while the state may do nothing but that which is authorised by law. [[Administrative law]] is the chief method for people to hold state bodies to account. People can apply for [[judicial review]] of actions or decisions by local councils, public services or government ministries, to ensure that they comply with the law. The first specialist administrative court was the ''[[Conseil d'Etat]]'' set up in 1799, as [[Napoleon]] assumed power in [[France]].

===Criminal law===
{{Main|Criminal law}}
[[Image:Newgate - cell and galleries from The Queen's London - a Pictorial and Descriptive Record of the Streets, Buildings, Parks and Scenery of the Great Metropolis, 1896.JPG|thumb|right|150px|An example of where criminals are sent after a conviction, [[London]]'s [[Newgate Prison]] in 1896]]
Criminal law is the most familiar kind of law from the papers, or TV news, despite its relatively small part in the legal whole. In every jurisdiction, a crime is committed where two elements are fulfilled. First, the criminal must have the requisite [[Intention (criminal)|malicious intent]] to do a criminal act, or ''[[mens rea]]'' (guilty mind). Second, he must commit the criminal act, or ''[[actus reus]]'' (guilty act). Examples of different kinds of crime might include [[murder]], [[assault]], [[fraud]] or [[theft]]. Defences can exist to some crimes, such as killing in [[Self-defense (theory)|self defence]], or pleading [[Insanity defense|insanity]]. A famous case in 19th century England, [[Regina v. Dudley and Stephens|''R v. Dudley and Stephens'']] <ref>''[[Regina v. Dudley and Stephens]]'' ([1884] 14 QBD 273 DC)</ref> involved the defence of "[[necessity]]". The ''Mignotte'', sailing from [[Southampton]] to [[Sydney]], sank. Three crew members, and a cabin boy, were stranded on a raft. They were starving, the cabin boy close to death. So the crew killed and [[cannibalism|ate]] the cabin boy. The crew survived and were rescued, but put on trial for murder. They argued it was necessary to kill the cabin boy to preserve their own lives. [[John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge|Lord Coleridge]], expressing immense disapproval, ruled, "to preserve one's life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it." They were sentenced to [[hanging|hang]]. Yet public opinion, especially among sea farers was outraged and overwhelmingly supportive. In the end, the [[Royal prerogative|Crown]] commuted their sentences to six months.

Criminal matters are considered to be offences against the whole community, rather than the individual victims. Hence the government takes the lead in prosecution and cases are cited as "''The People'' v. ..." or "''R.'' v. ..." Also, in many countries, lay [[jury|juries]] determine the guilt of defendants on points of fact, although they may not change legal rules themselves. Some developed countries still have [[capital punishment]] and [[torture]] for criminal activity, but the normal punishment for a crime will be [[prison|imprisonment]], fines, or [[community service]]. On the international field most countries have signed up to the [[International Criminal Court]], which was set up to try people for [[crimes against humanity]].

===Contract===
{{Main|Contract}}
[[Image:carbolic_smoke_ball_co.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The Carbolic Smoke Ball offer, which [[bankrupcy|bankrupted]] the Co. because it could not fulfill the terms it advertised]]
Contract is based on the Latin phrase ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]'' (promises must be kept)<ref>Wehberg, Hans (Oct., 1959) ''Pacta Sunt Servanda,'' The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 53, No. 4 , p.775; access at [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-9300%28195910%2953%3A4%3C775%3APSS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-6&size=SMALL JSTOR]</ref>. Almost everyone makes contracts everyday. Contracts can be made orally (e.g. buying a newspaper in a shop) or in writing (e.g signing a contract of employment). Sometimes [[statute of frauds|formalities]], such as writing the contract down or having it witnessed, are required for the contract to take effect (e.g. when buying a house<ref>e.g. In England, s.52 Law of Property Act 1925</ref>). 

In common law jurisdictions there are three key elements to the creation of a contract. These are [[offer and acceptance]], [[consideration]] and an intention to create legal relations. For example, in ''[[Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]]''<ref>''[[Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]]'' [1893] 2 QB 256</ref> a medical firm advertised that its new wonder drug, the smokeball, would cure people's flu, and if it did not, buyers would get £100. Lots of people sued for their £100 when it did not work. Fearing bankruptcy, Carbolic argued the advert was not to be taken as a serious, legally binding offer. It was merely an [[invitation to treat]], or mere puff, a gimmick. But the court of appeal held that to a [[reasonable man]] Carbolic had made a serious offer. People had given good "consideration" for it by going to the "distinct inconvenience" of using a faulty product. "Read the advertisement how you will, and twist it about as you will," said [[Nathaniel Lindley, Baron Lindley|Lord Justice Lindley]], "here is a distinct promise expressed in language which is perfectly unmistakable".

"Consideration" means all parties to a contract must exchange something of value to be able to enforce it. In some common law systems, like Australia, the concept of [[estoppel]] or ''culpa in contrahendo'' is used to create obligations during pre-contractual negotiations.<ref>''Austotel v. Franklins'' (1989) 16 NSWLR 582</ref> However, in [[civil law]] jurisdictions, consideration is not necessarily a requirement for a contract.<ref>e.g. In Germany, [http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/311.html § 311 Abs. II] [[BGB]]</ref> In France, an ordinary contract is said to form simply on the basis of a "meeting of the minds" or a "concurrence of wills".  Germany has a special approach to contracts, which ties into property law. Their 'abstraction principle' (''Abstraktionsprinzip'') means that the personal obligation of contract forms separately to the title of property being conferred. When contracts are invalidated for some reason, e.g. a car buyer is so drunk that he lacks legal capacity to contract,<ref>[http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/105.html § 105 Abs. II] [[BGB]]</ref> the contractual obligation to pay can be invalidated separate from proprietary title of the car. [[Unjust enrichment]] law, rather than the law of contract, is then used to restore title to the rightful owner.

===Tort===
{{Main|Tort}}
[[Image:Falwellhustler.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A [[Campari]] advert that led to the [[libel]] case of ''[[Hustler Magazine v. Falwell]]''<ref>''[[Hustler Magazine v. Falwell|Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell]]'', 485 U.S. 46 (1988)</ref>]]
Tort (also "[[delict]]") means 'civil wrong'. In order to have behaved tortiously, one must have breached a duty to another person, or infringed some pre-existing legal right. A simple [[Bolton v. Stone|example]] might be accidentally hitting someone with a cricket ball.<ref>''[[Bolton v. Stone]]'' [1951] A.C. 850</ref> In the law of [[negligence]], the injured party has a claim. Another example might be a neighbour making excessively loud noises with machinery on his property.<ref>''Sturges v. Bridgman'' (1879) 11 Ch D 852</ref> Under a [[nuisance]] claim the noise could be stopped. Torts can also involve intentional acts, such as [[Assault (tort)|assault]], [[Battery (tort)|battery]] or [[trespass]]. Of the better known torts are [[defamation]], for example when a newspaper libels a politician<ref>e.g. concerning a British politician and the Iraq war, ''[[George Galloway|Galloway]] v. Telegraph Group Ltd'' [2004] EWHC 2786</ref> or economic torts, which form the basis of [[labour law]] in some countries by making trade unions liable for strikes,<ref>''[[Taff Vale Railway Co. v. Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants]]'' [1901] AC 426</ref> where statute does not provide immunity<ref>in the U.K., [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]]; c.f. in the U.S., [[National Labor Relations Act]]</ref>.

Negligence is the most common form of tort. Its principles are illustrated by ''[[Donoghue v. Stevenson]]''<ref>''[[Donoghue v. Stevenson]]'' [1932] AC 532</ref>. Mrs Donoghue ordered an opaque bottle of [[ginger beer]] in a cafe in [[Paisley]]. Having consumed half of it, she poured the remainder into a tumbler. The decomposing remains of a dead [[snail]] floated out. She fell ill and sued the manufacturer for carelessly allowing the drink to be contaminated. The [[House of Lords]] decided that the manufacturer was liable for Mrs Donoghue's illness, because (1) he owed Mrs. Donoghue a [[duty of care]] to provide safe drinks, (2) he [[Breach of duty in English law|breached]] his duty of care, (3) the harm would not have occurred [[causation (law)|but for]] his breach, and (4) his act was the [[proximate cause]], or not too [[remoteness|remote]] a consequence, of her harm.

===Property law===
{{Main|Property law}}
[[Image:South Sea Bubble.jpg|200px|left|thumb|A painting of the [[South Sea Bubble]], one of the world's first ever [[speculation]]s and crashes, led to strict regulation on share trading]]
Property law governs everything that people call 'theirs'. [[Real property]], sometimes called 'real estate' or a right ''in rem'' refers to ownership of land and things attached to it.<ref>{{cite web | title=''Hunter v. Canary Wharf Ltd.'' (1997) 2 AllER 426 | url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldjudgmt/jd970424/hunter01.htm}}</ref> [[Personal property]], or a right ''in personam'' refers to everything else; movable objects, like computers or sandwiches or intangible rights, like [[Share (finance)|company shares]] or a [[copyright]] on a song. The classic civil law approach to property, propounded by [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] is that it is a right good against the world. This contrasts to an obligation, like a contract or tort, which is a right good between individuals.<ref>[[Friedrich Carl von Savigny|von Savigny, Friedrich]], ''Das Recht des Besitzes'' (1803) See here [http://dlib-pr.mpier.mpg.de/m/kleioc/0010/exec/books/%22235083%22] for the German text</ref> Preferred in common law jurisdictions is an idea closer to an obligation; that the person who can show the best claim to a piece of property, against any contesting party, is the owner.<ref>Matthews, Paul, ''The Man of Property'' [1995] 3 Med Law Rev 251-274</ref> The idea of [[property]] raises important philosophical and political issues. [[John Locke]] famously argued that our "lives, liberties and estates" are our property because we own our bodies and [[Labour theory of property|mix our labour]] with our surroundings.<ref>[[John Locke|Locke, John]] (1690) ''[[Second Treatise on Civil Government]]'' Ch. 9, s. 123 available [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/7370 here]</ref> But property is still a contentious concept. French philosopher [[Pierre Proudhon]] most famously proclaimed, "property is theft". <ref>{{cite book |last=Proudhon |first=Pierre |authorlink=Pierre Proudhon |title=[[What is Property?]] or An Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government (Qu'est-ce que la propriété? ou Recherche sur le principe du Droit et du Gouvernment)|year=1840 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/360 }}</ref>

Land law forms the basis for most kinds of property law, and is the most complex. It concerns [[mortgage]]s, [[leasehold estate|rental agreements]], [[license|licences]], [[covenant|convenants]], [[easements]] and the statutory systems for registration of land. Regulations on the use of personal property fall under [[intellectual property]], [[company (law)|company law]], [[trusts]] and [[commercial law]].

===Trusts and equity===   
{{Main|Trust law|Equity}}   
[[Image:UnderTheUmbrella.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Manhattan headquarters of the [[investment banking|investment bank]] [[Citigroup]]]]   
The trust is a form of ownership that developed in England through the courts of [[Chancery]]. It is part of a body of law known as 'equity'. Equity used to be administered by the English [[Lord Chancellor]] separately from common law courts. It operates on the basis of certain [[Maxims of equity|principles]] that remedied injustice that the common law created. Whereas at law, there may be only one owner of a piece of property, under a trust, the legal ownership of property is split. So called 'trustees' control the property, whereas the 'beneficial' (or 'equitable') ownership of the trust property is held by people known as 'beneficiaries'. Trusts are used mostly for holding large amounts of money. The most familiar kind of trust is a [[pension]] fund, where banks are trustees for people's savings until their retirement. Company law is [[The South Sea Company|historically based]] on the trust instrument. But trusts can also be set up for charitable purposes, famous examples being the [[British Museum]] or the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].   
    
Trustees owe things called equitable and [[fiduciary duties]] to the beneficiaries who they hold trust property for<ref>c.f. ''Bristol and West Building Society v. Mothew'' [1998] Ch 1</ref>. They must use the trust property for the benefit of the beneficiaries, rather than for themselves<ref>''Keech v. Sandford'' (1726) Sel Cas. Ch.61</ref>. Depending on the particular trust law of the jurisdiction, the nature of the trust property and the terms of the instrument that created the trust, the trustees will usually be expected to invest it or sell it<ref>''Nestle v. National Westminster Bank plc'' [1993] 1 WLR 1260</ref>, allow the beneficiaries to reside in it, or to transfer it to the beneficiaries absolutely.

===Further disciplines===
Law spreads far beyond the core subjects, into practically every area of life. Three categories are presented for convenience, though the subjects intertwine and flow into one another. Moreover these subjects may be of even greater ''practical'' importance than the traditional core subjects. The best way to grasp their importance is careful individual study.

;Law and Society
[[Image:UnisonStrikeRallyOxford20060328 KaihsuTai.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A trade union protest by [[UNISON]] while on strike ]]
* '''[[Labour law]]''' is the study of a tripartite industrial relationship, between worker, employer and [[trade union]]. This involves [[collective bargaining]] regulation, and the right to [[strike]]. Individual employment law refers to workplace rights, such as [[Occupational safety and health|health and safety]] or a [[minimum wage]].
* '''[[Human rights]]''' and [[human rights law]] are important fields to guarantee everyone basic freedoms and entitlements. These are laid down in codes such as the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[European convention on human rights]] and the [[U.S. Bill of Rights]].
* '''[[Civil procedure]]''' and '''[[criminal procedure]]''' concern the rules that courts must follow as a trial and appeals proceed. Both concern everybody's [[right to a fair trial]] or hearing.
* '''[[Evidence (law)|Evidence]]''' law involves which materials are admissible in courts for a case to be built.
* '''[[Immigration law]]''' and '''[[nationality law]]''' concern the rights of foreigners to live and work in a nation state that is not their own and to acquire or lose citizenship. Both also involve the rights of asylum and the problem of stateless individuals.
* '''[[Social security]]''' law refers to the rights people have to social insurance, such as jobseekers allowances or housing benefits.
* '''[[Family law]]''' covers marriage and divorce proceedings, the rights of children and of course the rights to property and money in the event of separation.

;Law and Commerce
[[Image:NYSE-floor.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[New York Stock Exchange]] trading floor today]]
* '''[[Commercial law]]''' is essentially complicated contract law. It deals with the ''Sale of Goods Acts'' and codified common law of commercial principles.
* '''[[Company law]]''' sprung from the law of trusts, on the principle of separating ownership and control.<ref>{{cite book |last=Berle |first=Adolf |authorlink=Adolf Berle |title=Modern Corporation and Private Property |year=1932 }}</ref> The law of the modern [[company (law)|company]] began with the ''Joint Stock Companies Act'', passed in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1865, which protected investors with [[limited liability]] and conferred [[separate legal personality]].
* '''[[Intellectual property]]''' deals with [[patent]]s, [[trademark]]s and [[copyright]]s. These are intangible assets, like the right not to have your idea for an invention stolen, a brand name or a song you have written.
*'''[[Restitution]]''' deals with the recovery of someone else's gain, rather than [[compensation]] for one's own loss.
* '''[[Unjust enrichment]]''' is law covering a right to retrieve property from someone that has profited unjustly at another's expense.

;Law and Regulation
[[Image:1930-67B.gif|thumb|right|150px|The [[New York Stock Exchange]] trading floor after the [[Wall Street Crash 1929]], before tougher [[banking regulation]] was introduced]]
* '''[[Tax law]]''' is probably the most complicated and well paid discipline, involving Value Added Tax, Corporation Tax, Income Tax, and most importantly, lots of money.
* '''[[Bank regulation|Banking law]]''' and [[financial regulation]] set minimum standards on the amounts of capital banks must hold, and rules about best practice for investment. This is to insure against the risk of economic crises, such as the [[Wall Street Crash]].
* '''[[Public Services|Regulated industries]]''' are attached to an important body of law for the provision  of public services. Since [[privatization]] became popular, private companies doing the jobs previously controlled by government have been bound by social responsibilities. Utilities, Telecomms and Water are regulated industries in most [[OECD]] countries.
* '''[[Antitrust|Competition law]]''', in the U.S. known as antitrust law, is an evolving and relatively new kind of law that began in the late 19th Century with the [[restraint of trade]] doctrine. The U.S. adopted anti-cartel and anti-monopoly statutes around the turn of that century. See the [[Sherman Act]] and [[Clayton Act]].
* '''[[Consumer Protection|Consumer Law]]''' could include anything from regulations on unfair contract terms and conditions, or directives on airline baggage insurance.
* '''[[Environmental law]]''' is increasingly important, especially in light of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and the imminent danger of [[climate change]]. Environmental protection also serves to [[Captin Planet|penalise polluters]] within countries.

==Legal systems==
[[Image:Milkau Oberer Teil der Stele mit dem Text von Hammurapis Gesetzescode 369-2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The King [[Hammurabi]] is revealed the [[Code of Hammurabi|code of laws]] by God]]
{{see also|Legal systems of the world}}
In general, legal systems around the world can be split between [[civil law (legal system)]] jurisdictions on the one hand and on the other systems using [[common law]] and equity. This is largely the result of countries having a shared history. The term civil law, referring to a legal system, should not be confused with [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] as distinguished from criminal law, or as distinguished from [[public law]]. A third type legal system still accepted by some countries, even whole countries, is religious law, based on Biblical transcripts.

===Civil law===
{{main|Civil law (legal system)}}
Civil law, as a type of legal system, is the form of law used by most countries around the world today. Civil law systems mainly derive from the [[Roman Empire]], and more particularly, the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' issued by the Emperor [[Justinian]] ca. 529AD. This was an extensive reform of the law in the Eastern Empire, bringing it together into [[codification|codified]] documents. Civil law today, in theory, is interpreted rather than developed or made by judges. Only [[legislature|legislative]] enactments (rather than [[judiciary|judicial]] [[precedent|precedents]]) are considered legally binding. However, in reality courts do pay attention to previous decisions, especially from higher courts. Countries that have civil law systems include [[Law of France|France]], [[Law of Germany|Germany]], [[Law of Russia|Russia]], [[Law of Japan|Japan]], [[Law of the People's Republic of China|China]] and most of central and Latin America.

===Common law and equity===
{{main|Common law}}
[[Image:King John of England signs the Magna Carta - Illustration from Cassell's History of England - Century Edition - published circa 1902.jpg|thumb|right|150px|King John of England signs the Magna Carta]]
English Law is the father of common law and equity, and is used in Commonwealth countries or former countries from the [[British Empire]], with the exception of Malta and Scotland both of which have an ingrained Civil Law system. The doctrine of ''[[stare decisis]]'' or precedent by courts is the major innovation and difference to codified civil law systems. Common law is currently in practice in [[Law of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Law of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Law of Australia|Australia]], [[Law of India|India]], [[Law of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Law of Canada|Canada]] (excluding Quebec), and the [[Law of the United States|United States]] (excluding Louisiana) and many more places. In addition to these countries, several others have adapted the common law system into a mixed system. For example, [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Nigeria]] operate largely on a common law system, but incorporate religious law. In the [[European Union]] the Court of Justice takes an approach mixing civil law (based on the treaties) with an attachment to the importance of case law. One of the most fundamental documents to shape common law is the [[Magna Carta]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Magna Carta|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html|accessdate=2006-11-10}}</ref> which placed limits on the power of the English Kings. It served as a kind of mediaeval bill of rights for the aristocracy and the judiciary who developed the law.

===Religious law===
{{main|Religious law}}
[[Image:Aleppo codex.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Aleppo Codex: 10th century Hebrew Bible with Masoretic pointing]]
The main kinds of religious law are [[Halakha]] in [[Judaism]], [[Sharia]] in [[Islam]], and [[Canon law]] in some [[Christian]] groups. In some cases these are intended purely as individual [[moral]] guidance, whereas in other cases they are intended and may be used as the basis for a country's legal system. The Halakha is followed by [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|conservative]] Jews in both ecclesiastical and civil relations. No country is fully governed by Halakha, but two Jewish people may decide, because of personal belief, to have a dispute heard by a Jewish court, and be bound by its rulings. Sharia Law governs a number of Islamic countries, including [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Iran]], though most countries use Sharia Law only as a supplement to national law. It can relate to all aspects of civil law, including property rights, contracts or public law. Canon law survives in use by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Anglican Communion]].

===History of law===
{{Main|Legal history}}
The history of law is, in a broad sense, the history of human [[civilization]]. Almost every legal system is interconnected in some way, each body of law being influenced by outside forces and jurisdictions over time.

;Ancient law
[[Image:Ac.pnyx.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Ancient Athens had the first quasi-democratic constitution]]
* Ancient Egyptian law had a civil code, based on the concept of [[Ma'at]]. Tradition, rhetorical speech, social equality and impartiality were key principles.<ref>VerSteeg, Russ (2002) ''Law in Ancient Egypt''  ISBN 0-89089-978-9</ref> Judges kept records, which were used as precedent, although the systems developed slowly.
* In ancient [[Babylon]], the King Hammurabi made the innovation of publishing his code of laws for the public to see in the market. This became known as the [[Codex Hammurabi]], part of a vast and complex body of [[babylonian law]]
* The [[Noahide Laws]] listed in the [[Torah]] were moral imperatives for forming a foundation for a well-functioning unified society. They were eventually succeeded by the [[Torah]], [[Mishna]], [[Talmud]] and [[Responsa]].
* In [[Ancient Athens]], the small Greek city-state developed the first government based on broad inclusion of the citizenry, excluding women and the slave class. [[Ancient Greek law|Ancient greek law]] contained major [[Constitution of the Athenians|constitutional]] innovations in the development of [[democracy]].

;European law
[[Image:Code Civil 1804.png|thumb|left|150px|First page of the 1804 edition of the Napoleonic Code]]
[[Roman law]] underwent major codification in the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] of Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]], as later developed through the [[Middle Ages]] by mediæval legal scholars. In Mediaeval England, judges retained greater power than their continental counterparts and began to develop a body of precedent. Originally civil law was one common legal system in much of [[Europe]], but with the rise of [[nationalism]] in the [[17th century]] [[Nordic]] countries and around the time of the [[French Revolution]], it became fractured into separate national systems. This change was brought about by the development of separate national codes, of which the French [[Napoleonic Code]] and the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German]] and [[ZGB|Swiss code]]s were the most influential. Around this time civil law incorporated many ideas associated with the [[Enlightenment]]. The European Union's Law is based on a codified set of laws, laid down in the [[European Union Law|Treaties]]. Law in the EU is however mixed with precedent in case law of the [[European Court of Justice]].

;Asian law
[[Image:Constitution of India.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[preamble]] of the '''Constitution of India''']]
[[History of China|Ancient China]] and [[History of India|ancient India]] had historically independent schools of legal theory and practice such as the ''[[Manusmriti|Laws of Manu]]'' or the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' in India and [[traditional Chinese law]] in China. Because Germany was a rising power in the late [[19th century]], and because civil law codifications are more 'exportable' the large bodies of common law jurisprudence, the German Civil Code has been highly influential for most oriental legal systems, and forms the basis of civil law in [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]]. In [[China]], the German Civil Code was introduced in the later years of the [[Qing Dynasty]] and formed the basis of the law of the [[Republic of China]] which remains in force in [[Taiwan]]. The current legal infrastructure in the [[People's Republic of China]] reflects influences from the German-based civil law, English-based common law in Hong Kong, Soviet-influenced [[Socialist law]], United States-style banking and securities law, and [[traditional Chinese law]]. In India, and other previous members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], English common law forms the basis of private law.

===Philosophy of law===
{{main|Jurisprudence}}
[[Image:Bentham.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Bentham's utilitarian theories remained dominant in law till the twentieth century]]
The philosophy of law is known as jurisprudence. Normative jurisprudence is essentially [[political philosophy]] and asks "what should law be?". Analytic jurisprudence asks on the other hand, "what is law?". An early famous philosopher of law was [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]], a student of [[Jeremy Bentham]] and first chair of law at the new [[University of London]] from 1829. Austin's [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] answer was that law is "commands, backed by threat of sanctions, from a sovereign, to whom people have a habit of obedience".<ref name="jap"/> This approach was long accepted, especially as an alternative to [[natural law]] theory. Natural lawyers argue human law reflects essentially moral and unchangeable laws of nature. For instance, [[Immanuel Kant]] believed a moral imperative requires laws "be chosen as though they should hold as universal [[law of nature|laws of nature]]".<ref>[[Immanuel Kant|Kant, Immanuel]], ''Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals'' in Lewis White Beck, ''Königliche Preussische Akademie der Wissenschaften'' Berlin, 1902-1938</ref> Austin and Bentham, following [[David Hume]] thought this conflated what [[Is-ought problem|"is" and what "ought to be"]] the case. They believed in law's [[legal positivism|positivism]], that real law is entirely separate from "morality".

In 1934, an Austrian philosopher named Hans Kelsen continued the positivist tradition in his book the ''[[Pure Theory of Law]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kelsen |first=Hans |authorlink=Hans Kelsen |title=[[Pure Theory of Law]] |year=1934 }}</ref> Kelsen believed that though law is separate from morality, it is endowed with "normativity", meaning we ought to obey it. Whilst laws are positive "is" statements (e.g. the fine for reversing on a highway ''is'' $500), law tells us what we "should" do (i.e. not drive backwards). So every legal system can be hypothesised to have a basic norm (''[[Grundnorm]]'') telling us we should obey the law.

[[Image:RonaldDworkin.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Dworkin is today's leading 'anti-positivist' thinker]]
Later in the twentieth century [[H.L.A. Hart]] attacked Austin for his simplifications and Kelsen for his fictions in ''[[The Concept of Law]]''<ref name="hhc"/>. As the chair of jurisprudence at [[Oxford University]], Hart argued law is a "system of rules". Rules, said Hart, are divided into primary rules (rules of conduct) and secondary rules (rules addressed to officials to administer primary rules). Secondary rules are divided into rules of adjudication (to resolve legal disputes), rules of change (allowing laws to be varied) and the rule of recognition (allowing laws to be identified as valid). Two of Hart's students have continued the debate since. [[Ronald Dworkin]] was his successor in the Chair of Jurisprudence at Oxford and his greatest critic. In his book ''Law's Empire''<ref name="rdl"/> Dworkin attacked Hart and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue. Dworkin argues that law is an "[[interpretivism|interpretive]] concept", that requires judges to find the best fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions. [[Joseph Raz]] on the other hand has defended the positivist outlook and even criticised Hart's 'soft social thesis' approach in ''The Authority of Law''<ref name="jra"/>. Raz argues that law is authority, identifiable purely through social sources, without reference to moral reasoning. Any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authoritative dispute mediation is best left to sociology, rather than jurisprudence.<ref>ch. 2, Joseph Raz, ''The Authority of Law'' (1979) Oxford University Press</ref>

===Economic analysis of law===
{{Main|Economic analysis of law}}
[[Image:richard posner.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Posner worked as a judge, an economist, an academic and even runs a [http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/ blog]]]
Economic analysis of law is an approach to legal theory that incorporates and applies the methods and ideas of [[economics]] to law. The discipline arose partly out of a critique of trade unions and U.S. [[Antitrust]] law. Today's proponents, such as [[Richard Posner]] from the so called [[Chicago School (economics)|Chicago School]] of economists and lawyers, are generally advocates of deregulation, privatization, and are hostile to state regulation, or what they see as restrictions on the operation of [[free market]]s.

The most decorated economic analyst of law is 1991 Nobel Prize winner [[Ronald Coase]]. His first major article, ''[[The Nature of the Firm]]'' (1937),<ref>[[Ronald H. Coase|Coase, Ronald]], ''[[The Nature of the Firm]]'' (1937) Economica, New Series, Vol. 4, No. 16 (Nov., 1937), pp. 386-405</ref> argued that the reason for the existence of firms ([[company law|companies]], partnerships, etc) is the existence of [[transaction costs]]. Rational individuals trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost effective. His second major article, ''The Problem of Social Cost'' (1960)<ref>[[Ronald H. Coase|Coase, Ronald]], [http://www.sfu.ca/~allen/CoaseJLE1960.pdf ''The Problem of Social Cost''], J. Law & Econ. 3, p. 1 (1960)</ref> argued that if we lived in a world without transaction costs, people would bargain with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes. Coase used the example of a [[nuisance]] case named ''Sturges v. Bridgman'',<ref>''Sturges v. Bridgman'' (1879) 11 Ch D 852</ref> where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move. Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor had to put up with it, they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves house that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only, the existence of transaction costs may prevent this. So the law ought to pre-empt what ''would'' happen, and be guided by the most [[Efficiency (economics)|efficient]] solution. The idea is that law, and regulation, is not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers, and government planners, believe.

==Legal institutions==
The main institutions of law in industrialised countries are independent courts, representative parliaments, an accountable executive, the military and police, bureaucratic organisation, the profession of lawyers and civil society itself. [[John Locke]] in ''Two Treatises On Civil Government'' <ref>[[John Locke|Locke, John]] (1690) ''[[Second Treatise on Civil Government]]'' available [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/7370 here]</ref> and [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]] after him in ''Spirit of Laws'' <ref>{{cite book|last=de Montesquieu|first=Baron|authorlink=Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu |title=De l'esprit des lois|year=1748|url=http://www.constitution.org/cm/sol.htm}}</ref> advocated a [[separation of powers]] between the institutions that wield political influence, namely the [[judiciary]], [[legislature]] and [[executive (government)|executive]]. Their principle was that no person should be able to usurp, as [[Thomas Hobbes]] wanted for an all powerful sovereign, a ''[[Leviathan (book)|Leviathan]]''<ref>>{{cite book|last=Hobbes|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Hobbes|title=Leviathan|year=1651|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3207}}</ref> of power. More recently [[Max Weber]], and many others, have reshaped twentieth century about the extensions of the state, which come under the control of the executive. Modern [[military]], [[policing]] and [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] power over ordinary citizens' daily lives pose special problems for accountability that earlier writers like Locke and Montesquieu could not have foreseen. The custom and practice of the [[legal profession]] itself is an important part of people's access to justice, whilst [[civil society]] is a term used to refer the social institutions, communities and partnerships that are the political base of the law.

===Judiciary===
{{Main|Judiciary}}
[[Image:Old Bailey Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|right|A trial at the [[Old Bailey]] in [[London]] as drawn by Thomas Rowlandson and Augustus Pugin (1808-11).]]
A judiciary is a group of judges who mediate and determine the outcome of peoples' disputes. Most countries have a system of appeals courts, up to a supreme authority. In the U.S. this is the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Supreme Court|url=http://www.supremecourtus.gov/|accessdate=2006-11-10}}</ref> or in Australia, the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]]. In the U.K. the highest court is the [[House of Lords]],<ref>{{cite web|title=House of Lords Judgments|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldjudgmt.htm|accessdate=2006-11-10}}</ref> Germany has the [[Bundesverfassungsgericht]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The German Federal Constitutional Court|url=http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen.html|accessdate=2006-11-10}}</ref> and the highest judicial authority in France is the [[Cour de cassation (France)|Cour de Cassation]].
However, for most European countries the [[European Court of Justice]]<ref>{{cite web|title=European Court of Justice|url=http://curia.europa.eu/en/transitpage.htm|accessdate=2006-11-10}}</ref> in Luxembourg may overrule national law, where EU law is relevant. Also the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in Strasbourg allows any European citizen to appeal cases to it, where human rights issues arise.

Almost every country in the world allows its highest judicial authority to strike down legislation that is determined to be [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. For instance, the United States Supreme Court struck down a [[Texas|Texan]] law forbidding women to be assisted with [[abortion]] in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''<ref>''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973) [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=410&page=113 410 U.S. 113] Retrieved [[2007-01-26]]</ref>. The constitution's [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|fourteenth amendment]] is interpreted to give Americans a right to [[privacy]], and a woman's [[Pro-choice|right to choose]] to have an abortion is part of that. The judiciary is theoretically bound by a constitution, as much legislatures are. In most countries judges may only [[Interpretivism (legal)|interpret]] the constitution, and all other laws. However in common law countries, where matters are not constitutional, the judiaciary may also create law under the doctrine of [[precedent]]. On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland and New Zealand still assert the ideal of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], whereby the unelected judiciary may not overturn law passed by a [[democratic]] legislature.

===Legislature===
{{Main|Legislature}}
[[Image:European-parliament-brussels-inside.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The [[debating]] chamber of the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]]]]
The [[Houses of Parliament]] in London, the [[United States Congress|Congress]] in Washington D.C., the [[Bundestag]] in Berlin, the [[Duma]] in Moscow and the [[National Assembly of France|''Assemblée nationale'']] in Paris are all examples of legislatures. The principle of representative government means that people vote for political decision makers to carry out their wishes. Most legislatures are [[Bicameralism|bi-cameral]], having two legislative houses. In a 'lower house' politicians are elected to represent smaller [[constituency|constituencies]]. The 'upper house' is usually elected to represent a larger state in a [[federal]] system (as in Australia or Germany), or a different voting configuration (as in France) or in a unitary system the upper house is appointed to be advisors of the Crown(as in the UK).

To pass legislation a majority of Members of Parliament must [[vote]] for a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] in each house. Normally there will be several readings and amendments proposed by the different [[political party|political factions]]. If a country has an entrenched constitution a special majority for changes to the constitution will be required, making changes to the law more difficult. A [[government]] usually leads the process, which can be formed from Members of Parliament (e.g. the U.K. or Germany). But in a presidential system, an executive appoints a cabinet to govern from his or her political allies whether or not they are elected (e.g. the U.S. or Brazil) and the legislature's role is reduced to either ratification or veto.

===Executive===
{{Main|Executive (government)|Head of State}}
[[Image:Hu Jintao during a defense meeting held at the Pentagon, May 2002, cropped.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Hu Jintao]] is both [[President of China|president]] and head of China's only [[Communist party (China)|legal political party]]]]
The "executive" in a legal system refers to the governing centre of political authority. In most democratic countries, like the UK, Germany, India and Japan, the executive is elected into and drawn from the legislature and is known as a [[cabinet]]. Alongside there is usually an appointed head of state, such as the [[President of Germany|Bundespräsident]] or an hereditary one, like the [[Queen of the United Kingdom]] who carries out the symbolic function of enacting legislation, but has no formal political power. The other important model is found in countries like France, the U.S. and Russia. Under such [[presidential system]]s the executive is directly elected by a popular vote, and may appoint a cabinet that is not directly elected.

The executive's role may vary from country to country. Usually, it will initiate or propose the majority of [[legislation]] and deal with a country's [[foreign relations]]. The [[military]] and [[police]] often fall under executive control, as does the bureaucracy. Ministers, or [[Secretary of State|secretaries of state]] of the government head a country's public offices, such as the [[health department]], or the [[department of justice]]. The [[election]] of a different executive is therefore capable of [[Revolution|revolutionising]] an entire country's approach to government.

===Military and police===
{{Main|Military|Police}}
[[Image:US Customs and Border Protection officers.jpg|thumb|left|[[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] officers]]
The military and police are sometimes referred to as "the long arms of the law". Whilst military organisation has existed as long as have governments, a standing police force is a relatively modern invention. Mediaeval England, for instance, used a system of travelling criminal courts, or [[assizes]] to keep communities under control. The first modern police were probably those in 17th century Paris, in the court of [[Louis XIV]], although the Paris Prefecture of Police's website claims were the first uniformed policemen in the world<ref>{{cite web|title=La Préfecture de Police|url=http://www.prefecture-police-paris.interieur.gouv.fr/documentation/bicentenaire/theme_expo4.htm
|accessdate = 2007-01-24}}</ref>. In 1829, after the [[French Revolution]] and [[Napoleon]]'s dictatorship,  a government decree created the first uniformed policemen in Paris and all French cities, known as ''sergents de ville'' ("city sergeants"). In Britain, the [[Metropolitan Police Act]] 1829 was passed by Parliament under [[home secretary]] Sir [[Robert Peel]], founding the London [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]].

Sociologist [[Max Weber]] famously argued that the state is that which controls the legitimate monopoly of the means of violence.<ref name="mwp">{{citebook|last=Weber|first=Max|authorlink=Max Weber|title=Politik als Beruf|year=1919|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Politics_as_a_Vocation}}</ref> Military and police personnel carry out enforcement activities at the request of the government or the courts. The term [[failed state]] is used where the police and military no longer uphold security and order and society descends into [[civil war]], [[anarchy]] or chaos.

===Bureaucracy===
{{Main|Bureaucracy}}
[[Image:Administrative_Affairs.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bureaucracy was satirised by the 1980s British comedy "[[Yes Minister]]", which concerned civil servants in the so called "Department of Administrative Affairs"]]
The word "bureaucracy" derives from the French for "office" (''bureau'') and Ancient Greek for "power" (''kratos''). It refers to all government servants and bodies who carry out the wishes of the executive. The concept dates from 18th century France. [[Friedrich Melchior, baron von Grimm|Baron de Grimm]], a German author who lived in France, wrote in 1765,

<blockquote>"The real spirit of the laws in France is that bureaucracy of which the late Monsieur de Gournay used to complain so greatly; here the offices, clerks, secretaries, inspectors and ''intendants'' are not appointed to benefit the public interest, indeed the public interest appears to have been established so that offices might exist."<ref>[[Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm|Melchior, Friedrich]] and [[Denis Diderot|Diderot, Denis]] (1813 Ed.) ''Correspondence littéraire, philosophique et critique, 1753-69'' Vol. 4, p. 146 & 508 - cited by Albrow, Martin (1970) ''Bureaucracy'' p. 16</ref></blockquote>

Cynicism over "officialdom" is still common, and the workings of public servants is often contrasted to [[private enterprise]] driven by the profit motive.<ref>{{cite book |last=von Mises |first=Ludwig | authorlink=Ludwig von Mises |title=Bureaucracy | origyear=1944 |url=http://www.mises.org/etexts/bureaucracy.pdf |accessdate=2006-11-10 | year=1962 }}</ref> Writing in the early 20th century, [[Max Weber]] believed that a definitive feature of a developed state had come to be its bureaucratic support<ref name="mwp"/>. The stereotypical bureaucracy involves armies of white collared workers controlling and producing information, bound in 'red tape'. However state agencies also play a positive role, in redistributing resources at the wish of the elected representatives, which is collected from taxation, or organising crucial [[public services]] such as schooling, health care, policing or public transport.

===Legal profession===
{{Main|Legal profession}}
[[Image:Advokat, Engelsk advokatdräkt, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|150px|left|An English barrister]]
[[Practice of law]] is typically overseen by either a government organization or independent regulating body such as a [[bar association]], [[bar council]], barrister society, or [[law society]]. To practice law, the regulating body must certify the practitioner. This usually entails a two or three-year program at a university [[faculty of law]] or a [[law school]], which earns the student a [[Bachelor of Laws]], a [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] or a [[Juris Doctor]] degree. This course of study is followed by an entrance examination (e.g. [[bar admission]]). Some countries require a further vocational qualification before a person is permitted to practice law. In the case of those wishing to become a [[barrister]], this would lead to a Barrister-at-law degree, followed by a year's apprenticeship (sometimes known as pupillage or devilling) under the oversight of an experienced barrister (or master). Advanced law degrees are also often pursued, though they are academic degrees and are not required for the practice of law. These include a [[Master of Laws]], a [[M.S.L.|Master of Legal Studies]], and a [[Doctor of Laws]].

Once accredited, a lawyer will often work in a [[law firm]], in a [[chambers]], as a sole practitioner, for a government or as internal counsel at a private corporation. Another option is to become a legal researcher who provides on-demand legal research through a commercial service or on a freelance basis. Many people trained in law put their skills to use outside the legal field entirely. A significant component to the practice of law in the common law tradition involves [[legal research]] in order to determine the current state of the law. This usually entails exploring [[Law report|case-law reports]], [[legal periodicals]] and [[legislation]]. Law practice also involves drafting documents such as court [[pleadings]], persuasive [[brief (law)|brief]]s, [[contract]]s, or [[will]]s and [[trust law|trust]]s. Negotiation and [[dispute resolution]] skills are also important parts of legal practice, depending on the field.

===Civil society===
{{Main|Civil Society}}
[[Image:1963 march on washington.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A march in Washington DC, during the civil rights movement in 1963]]
Perhaps the most crucial institution in the law is simply the civil partnerships and associations of ordinary people holding no official positions. [[Freedom of Speech]], and [[Freedom of Association]] are our human rights, our civil liberties and most developed and developing countries uphold them. They form the basis of an active, thoughtful and [[deliberative democracy]]. The more people are involved with and concerned by how political power is exercised over their lives, the more acceptable and legitimate the law becomes to the people. Developed [[political parties]] or [[Cogers|debating clubs]], [[trade union]]s, impartial [[mass media|media]], [[charities]] and perhaps even [[Wikipedia|online encyclopedias]] are signs of a healthy civil society.

The term "civil society" traces back to [[Adam Ferguson]], who saw the development of a "commercial state" as a way to change the corrupt feudal order and strengthen the liberty of the individual.<ref>[http://oll.libertyfund.org/Home3/Book.php?recordID=1229 An Essay on the History of Civil Society] (1767)</ref> Later on, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], a [[Germany|German]] [[philosophy|philosopher]], made the distinction between society and the 'state' in his ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]''.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/preface.htm Etext of Philosophy of Right Hegel (1827) translated by Dyde, 1897]</ref> Hegel thought civil society (''Zivilgesellschaft'') was a stage on the [[dialectical|dialectical relationship]] between Hegel's perceived opposites, the macro-community of the [[state]] and the micro-community of the [[family]].<ref>Pelczynski, A.Z. (1984) ''The State and Civil Society'' pp.1-13 Cambridge University Press</ref>
