'''Pike Place Market''' is a [[public market]] overlooking the [[Elliott Bay]] waterfront in [[Seattle, Washington]], [[United States]]. The Market, which opened August 17, 1907, is the third-oldest continually-operational farmer's market in the country behind [[Soulard, St. Louis|Soulard Farmers' Market]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and the [[Reading Terminal Market]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], and is patterned in part after a Turkish souq.  It is a place of business for many small [[merchant]]s and a popular [[tourist]] destination. Located in the [[Downtown, Seattle, Washington|downtown]] area, it occupies over 9 acres (36,000&nbsp;m²). The Market is bounded by First Avenue to the east, Western Avenue to the west, Virginia Street to the north, and, to the south, a line drawn from First to Western Avenues halfway between Pike Street and Union Street. It is named after its central street, Pike Place, which runs northwest from Pike Street to Virginia Street.

The Market is built on the edge of a steep [[hill]]. It has several lower levels below the main level, featuring a variety of unique [[Retailing#Shops and stores|shops]]. [[Antiques|Antique]] dealers, [[comic book]] sellers, and small family-owned [[restaurant]]s are joined by one of the few remaining [[head shop]]s in Seattle. The upper street level features [[fishmonger]]s, fresh [[produce]] stands, and [[craft]] stalls operating in the covered [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s. Local [[farmer]]s sell year-round in the arcades from tables they [[Renting|rent]] on a daily basis.

The market is surrounded by [[Belltown, Seattle, Washington|Belltown]] on the north and the central business district and the central waterfront on the east and south, respectively.  Boundaries are diagonal to the compass since the street grid is roughly parallel to [[Elliott Bay]].<ref>(1) {{cite web

The neighborhood elevation is several hundred feet and the slope steep, so views can be impressive, but for the block-shaped [[Alaskan Way Viaduct]] built in 1953.  The heart of the neighborhood is the Pike Place Market and [[Victor Steinbrueck Park]].  

The original shore was [[mudflats]] below the bluffs west of Pike Place.  In the later 19th century, Railroad Avenue was built on pilings through filled mudflats along what is now Western Avenue, with Alaskan Way built farther out as the fill was extended.  Piers with warehouses for convenient [[stevedore|stevedoring]] were extended northwest as filling was completed by 1905.<ref>Phelps, pp. 71-73</ref>
The Pike Place Market is listed in the United States [[National Register of Historic Places]].

==History==
[[Image:Lib washington edu Seattle, E fr. waterfront ~Pike St, n.d. (1891-1907); 398, 296382125102001 602.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Looking east from the Elliott Bay waterfront near Pike Street.  The first Washington Hotel (1891-1906, center, background) sits atop the small, steep Denny Hill, regraded in 1906-1907.  At the shore is Railroad Avenue on pilings, now Western Avenue.  Alaskan Way apparently does not yet exist, so this is before the completion of filling in 1905.]]
Between 1906 and 1907 the price of onions rose from 10 cents per pound to $1.00 per pound. (By comparison, a pair of shoes cost $2).  Seattle citizens, angry at price-gouging middlemen, pressured the city to establish a public market whereby customers could 'meet the producer' directly (this philosophy was more or less remained the same to this day). City councilman Thomas Revelle spearheaded the drive to start a Saturday morning market. And so on Saturday,[[August 17]], [[1907]]{{ref|official-web-history}} roughly ten farmers pulled up their wagons on a [[boardwalk]] adjacent to the [[Leland Hotel]]. After an enthusiastic response from local shoppers, the first building at the Market was opened in late 1907{{ref|history-link}}. Within a decade, the Corner Market, Economy Market, Sanitary Market, and North Arcade were subsequently built.

By the 1940s, more than two-thirds of the stalls in Pike Place Market were owned by [[Japanese-American]]s. Following [[United States Executive Order 9066|Executive Order 9066]] in February of 1942, all Americans of Japanese ancestry in the "exclusion zone" of western [[Washington]], western [[Oregon]], [[California]], and southern [[Arizona]] were interned in camps. Their property, including any stalls at Pike Place, was confiscated and sold.

In 1963, a proposal was floated to demolish Pike Place Market and replace it with [[Pike Plaza]], which would include a [[hotel]], an [[apartment building]], four [[office building]]s, a [[hockey]] arena, and a [[parking garage]]. This was supported by the [[mayor]], many on the [[city council]], and a number of market property owners. However, there was significant community opposition, including help from [[Betty Bowen]] and others from the board of Friends of the Market, and an [[initiative]] was passed on [[November 2]], [[1971]] that created a [[historic preservation]] zone. The [[Pike Place Market Public Development Authority]] was created and the market buildings were brought into public ownership.

[[Victor Steinbrueck Park]], just northwest of the market, was named in 1985 after the [[architect]] who was instrumental in the market's preservation.

==Major attractions==
[[Image:Fruits and Vegetables at Pike Place Market.jpg|220px|thumb|The market is famous for stunning displays of fruits and vegetables]]
[[Image:Original Starbucks.jpg|220px|right|thumb|The first Starbucks store, founded nearby in 1971, moved to its present location at Pike Place Market in 1976]]
One of the Market's major attractions is Pike Place Fish Market, where employees throw [[fish]] to each other rather than passing them by hand. The "flying fish" have appeared in an episode of the television [[sitcom]] ''[[Frasier]]'' that was shot on location and have been featured on [[The Learning Channel]].

[[Starbucks Coffee]] was founded near Pike Place Market in 1971. The first store relocated to Pike Place Market in 1976, where it is still in operation. The sign outside this branch, unlike others, features a bare-breasted [[siren]]. It also features a large [[pig]] [[statue]] covered in roasted [[coffee bean]]s.

== Notable buildings ==
The Pike Market neighborhood is largely defined by the concentration of historic buildings in the small area.  Due to complexities and competing interests, only some if not few historic structures or places are officially designated.  The Alaska Trade Building (1900–1924), 1915–1919 1st Avenue;<ref>{{cite web

The Pike Place Market is also a building, the arcade (1907) which is the original Main Market, and an Historic District.  Extant buildings are the arcade, the Outlook Hotel and Triangle Market (1908), Sanitary Market (1910), extended arcade (1911), Corner Market building (1912), Fairley Building (1914), and Economy Market (c. 1914–17, nee Bartell Building, 1900).  The Sanitary Market was so named for its innovation at the time, that no horses were allowed inside.<ref>(1) Lange  <br>(2) Crowley</ref>  

[[Image:Lib washington edu Moore Hotel ext. & lobby, Seattle, ca. 1907; 2699, 2700.jpg|left|thumb|A postcard from the Moore Hotel and Theater, c. 1907.]]
The Moore Theater (1907), on the corner of 2nd Avenue at Virginia Street, is the oldest still-extant theater in Seattle.  Innovative architecture, luxurious materials, and sumptuous decor characterized the Moore (including an [[apartheid]] balcony with separate entrances, though the balcony was well-appointed for its day).  The staging area was the largest of any theater in Seattle, with an electrical system that was state-of-the-art for its time, and unusually numerous dresesing rooms.  Seating 2436, the Moore was one the largest theatres in the U.S. at the time. Other innovations included a hotel, intended for the the 10th anniversary 1907 [[Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition]] (rescheduled for 1909).  The Moore was a lavish social venue for the [[Robber Baron]] elite of [[Gilded Age]] and early 20th century Seattle.  Excellent programming carried the Moore through the 1930s, but changes in entertainment gradually led to struggling to survive by the 1970s.  The Moore Theatre and Hotel was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>  The Moore became the Moore-Egyptan (after the luxury motion picture theatre on [[The Ave]] in the [[University District, Seattle, Washington|University District]], converted to a drugstore c. 1960).  The Moore-Egyptan was rescued as a movie theatre with innovative programming, and became the original home for the [[Seattle International Film Festival]] (SIFF, 1976).  Dan Ireland and Darryl Macdonald were the leading talents in the success.  Moore owners declined to renew the lease, and the SIFF moved to the [[Masonic Temple]] on [[Capitol Hill, Seattle, Washington|Capitol Hill]].  The Moore has hosted touring musicians and theatrical productions since the 1980s, currently seating about 1,400.<ref>Flom</ref>

The [[Seattle Aquarium]] (1977) is on the waterfront at Pier 59.  The waterfront includes the turn of the century piers 59, 61, 62, and 63.  The city purchased piers 59–61 in 1971 after the central waterfront had been abandoned by freight shipping for years, supplanted by [[container ship]]ping.  Historic Piers 60 and 61 were later removed for aquarium expansion.  In 1979 an OMNIMAX theatre opened (now ''Seattle IMAXDome''), at the time one of only about half a dozen in the world.<ref>McRoberts</ref>  The theater is an early tilted dome iteration of [[IMAX]].

== Notable people ==
In addition to Dan Ireland and Darryl Macdonald, who were instrumental in rescuing the Moore Theater and in establishing the SIFF, [[Victor Steinbrueck]] was the leading architect-activist in defining the Pike Market neighborhood, and artist [[Mark Tobey]] in visualizing and recording, in developing his "Northwest Mystic" style of the internationally-recognized Northwest School of art.  Internationally recognized in the 1940s, Tobey explored the neighborhood with his art in the 1950s and early 1960s,<ref>(1) Lehmann  <br>(2) Long</ref> as the area was being increasingly characterized by the Seattle Establishment as overdue for [[urban renewal]], particularly replacement with a parking garage, high-rise housing and modern, upscale retail.<ref>Crowley</ref>  People of city neighborhoods and citizen preservation activists struggled through the 1960s, culminating in 1971 with 2 to 1 passage of a citizen initiative for protection and citizen oversight of the core Pike Place Market that has since largely protected the neighborhood.<ref>(1) Lange  <br>(2) Crowley <br>(3) Wilma</ref>
