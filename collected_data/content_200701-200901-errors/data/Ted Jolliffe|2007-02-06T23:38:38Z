'''Edward (Ted) Bigelow Jolliffe''' ([[1909]]-[[1998]]) was a Canadian politician and lawyer and was the first leader of the [[Ontario New Democratic Party|Ontario Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]]. Born to [[missionary]] parents,  Jolliffe was home-schooled in China by his mother until his early teens. He subsequently attended the [[University of Toronto]] and then [[Oxford University]] as a [[Rhodes Scholar]] at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]. He became a [[socialist]] and joined the [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]] shortly after it was formed in 1932. 

He was a candidate in the [[Canadian federal election, 1935|1935 Canadian election]] in the [[Toronto]] [[riding]] of [[St. Paul's (electoral district)|St. Paul's]], placing fourth, and ran in the [[Canadian federal election, 1940|1940 election]] in [[York East]], placing third.

He became the first leader of the Ontario CCF in [[1942]] and took it to within five seats of victory with 34 seats and 32% of the vote in the [[Ontario general election, 1943|election of 1943]] that elected a Conservative [[minority government]] under [[George Drew]]. In the [[Ontario general election, 1945|1945 Ontario election]], Drew ran an [[anti-Semitic]], union bashing, [[Red-baiting]] campaign. Jolliffe replied by giving a radio speech (written by [[Lister Sinclair]]) that accused Drew of running a political [[gestapo]] in Ontario. Jolliffe alleged that a secret department of the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] was acting as a political police spying on the opposition and the media. This accusation led to a backlash, and loss of support for the CCF (from 34 seats to 8), including the loss of Jolliffe's own seat of [[York South]], in the election. In the 1970s, archival evidence was discovered proving the charge. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Jolliffe faced a leadership challenge in [[1946]], but was re-elected CCF leader. 

As a result of the [[Ontario general election, 1948|1948 Ontario election]], the CCF recovered, winning 21 seats. Jolliffe again became [[Leader of the Opposition]] in Ontario and [[Member of Provincial Parliament]] (MPP) for York South. In 1951, however, as a result of the [[Cold War]] and the "[[Second Red Scare|red scare]]",  the CCF and labour movement acted to purge individuals (including CCF MPP Bob Carlin) suspected of being under [[Communist]] influence.  Among the general public, support for socialism suffered: the CCF was reduced to only two seats in the [[Ontario general election, 1951|1951 election]]. Jolliffe lost his own seat and resigned as party leader in [[1953]]. 

He returned to his previous career as a labour lawyer, founding the firm Jolliffe, Lewis and Osler with fellow CCF activist and future York South [[Member of Parliament]] [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]]. In the 1950s and 1960s, the firm assisted the [[Steelworkers]] union in their fight with the [[Mine, Mill & Smelter Workers]] union in [[Sudbury, Ontario]].In the later years of his life he was active as an adjudicator for Canada Post.
