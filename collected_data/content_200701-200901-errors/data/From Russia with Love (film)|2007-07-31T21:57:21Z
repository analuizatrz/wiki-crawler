'''''From Russia with Love''''' is a [[1963 in film|1963]] [[spy film]]. It is the second [[film]] in the [[James Bond]] [[James Bond (films)|series]], and the second to star [[Sean Connery]] as [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]]. The film was produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], and directed by [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]]. It is based on the [[From Russia with Love|1957 novel]] by [[Ian Fleming]].  The world premiere was on [[October 10]], [[1963 in film|1963]], at the Odeon, Leicester Square, London. In the film, James Bond is sent to [[Turkey]] to assist in the defection of Corporal Tatiana Romanova, where SPECTRE plans to get revenge for the killing of [[Dr. Julius No|Dr. No]].

It is widely considered one of the best films in the James Bond film series by many critics.<ref name="RotTom">[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/from_russia_with_love/ From Russia with Love at Rotten Tomatoes] URL accessed [[July 29]], [[2007]]</ref> Although the film's low-key tone contrasts the glamour of its successors ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' and ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', it is often considered the quintessential Bond style that each film strives to aim for. [[Michael G. Wilson]], the current co-producer of the series with his half sister [[Barbara Broccoli]], has stated "We always start out trying to make another ''From Russia with Love'' and end up with another ''Thunderball''." In 2004, ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine named it the ninth-greatest British film of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3711460.stm |title=Get Carter tops British film poll |accessdate=2007-07-28 |date=[[2004-10-03]] |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>

In 2005 it was adapted into a [[video game]], ''[[James Bond 007: From Russia with Love]]''. Produced by [[Electronic Arts]], the game featured all-new voice work by Sean Connery as well as his likeness and those of several of the film's supporting cast.

==Production==

As [[John F. Kennedy|President John F. Kennedy]] had named Fleming's novel ''[[From Russia with Love]]'' among his ten favourite books of all time, producers Broccoli and Saltzman chose this as the follow-up to the cinematic debut of [[James Bond]], ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''.<ref name="documentry"/> [[Ian Fleming]]'s novel was a [[Cold War]] thriller, however the producers made the villains [[SPECTRE]] instead of the [[Soviet]] undercover agency [[SMERSH]].  This was to avoid accusations of promoting hatred against the Russians. The film introduced the standard pre-credits sequence, the use of a popular singer to sing the theme, and the line "James Bond will return" in the credits.

Although uncredited, the actor who played [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]], was [[Anthony Dawson]], who had played Professor Dent in the previous Bond film, ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''. In the end credits, Blofeld is credited with a [[question mark]]. Blofeld's voice was provided by Viennese actor [[Eric Pohlmann]]. It is rumoured that author and James Bond creator Ian Fleming plays a cameo in the Istanbul train scene, standing outside the train, wearing grey trousers and a white sweater; some sources deny Fleming's appearance.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.panos.gr/mkkbb/afjbfaq/4.shtml|title=Ian Fleming.org|accessdate=2007-07-28}} </ref>

The scene in which Bond finds Tatiana in his hotel bed later became the traditional [[screen test]] scene for prospective James Bond actors. This screen test forms part of the Ultimate Edition DVD series, showing potential candidates auditioning for the role down the years: [[James Brolin]], [[Sean Bean]] and [[Sam Neill]] along with future 007 [[Pierce Brosnan]].  The scene has also been used to audition several James Bond leading ladies, including [[Maryam D'Abo]] and [[Maud Adams]].<ref>{{cite video | year = 2006 | title = Inside Octopussy Documentary — Octopussy Ultimate Edition | medium = DVD | publisher = MGM }}</ref><ref>{{cite video | year = 2006 | title = Inside The Living Daylights Documentary — The Living Daylights Ultimate Edition | medium = DVD | publisher = MGM }}</ref>

Pedro Armendariz was suffering from cancer throughout the production, reportedly acting in the film to leave his family money behind. Armendariz's scenes were brought forward due to his health so that they could complete his scenes. Armendariz commited suicide after all his scenes were filmed and his funeral was attended by most of the cast.<ref name="documentry">{{cite video | year = 2006 | title = Inside From Russia with Love Documentary — From Russia with Love Ultimate Edition | medium = DVD | publisher = MGM }}</ref>

===Vehicles and gadgets===

{{main|List of James Bond vehicles|List of James Bond gadgets}}
The film established the use of unique gadgets that Bond would use throughout the series. The gadgets featured were the [[Briefcase|attaché case]], a briefcase issued by Q-Branch containing a [[tear gas]] bomb that detonates if it is improperly opened, and a folding [[AR-7]] [[sniper rifle]] with twenty rounds of ammunition. It also had a pop-out flat throwing knife and fifty [[gold sovereign]]s for bribery, a hard currency reserve in secret compartments. Although ''From Russia with Love'' was filmed in the [[1960s]], before the pager was invented, Bond carried one, enabling MI6 to contact him at once; also, Bond's [[Bentley]] automobile had a radio-telephone. Other gadgets were a tapped phone detector and a [[tape recorder]] disguised as a camera.

===Film locations=== 
[[Image:Istanbul - Basilica Cistern - 01.JPG|left|thumb|260px|The [[Basilica Cistern]] underneath [[Istanbul]], one of several famous landmarks featured in the film]]
Most of the film was based in [[Istanbul]] including the [[Basilica Cistern]] and [[Hagia Sophia]], with the initial Mi6 office in [[London]], [[England]]. SPECTRE Island and the interior scenes of the [[Orient Express]] were filmed at [[Pinewood Studios]] with some footage of the train. In the film, the train journey was set in Eastern Europe. The journey and the truck ride were shot in [[Argyll]], [[Scotland]], and [[Switzerland]]. The end scenes for the film were shot in [[Venice]].<ref name="documentry"/>

==Plot==
At late night in a mansion garden where James Bond is alternately stalking and being stalked by a tall, blond assassin. Bond is captured and strangled violently to death by the man named [[Red Grant]], using a garrot wire hidden in a watch. Suddenly, huge floodlights switch on and the dead person turns out to be a man wearing a Bond's disguise. This completes the crime syndicate SPECTRE's training exercise. 

[[Image:KlebbtestsGrant.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rosa Klebb]] approves of 
[[Red Grant]]]]
[[Kronsteen]], a chess [[grandmaster]] and SPECTRE's planner has devised a plot to steal a Lektor decoding device from the Russians, and embarrass the British Secret Service in revenge for the killing of their operative Dr. No. Ex-[[SMERSH]] operative [[Rosa Klebb]] is placed in charge of the mission by the megalomaniac [[Blofeld]] and has already chosen a female operative, a Russian cypher clerk at the Istanbul embassy. Klebb departs to SPECTRE Island, the organisation's secret training base, and approves [[Red Grant]], as an assassin.

In London, M tells Bond that Tatiana Romanova, the cypher clerk at the Istanbul embassy, has contacted their "Station 'T'" in [[Turkey]], asking to defect with a Lektor cryptographic device, which both [[MI6]] and the [[CIA]] have been after for years. She has stipulated that she will only defect to Bond, whose photo she has allegedly found in a Soviet intelligence file. Bond flies to [[Istanbul]] to meet station head Ali Karim Bey, and he is followed from the airport both by an unkempt man in glasses, who is in turn tailed by Red Grant.

The next day, after Bey's office is bombed, Bond and Bey spy on the Russian embassy using a periscope from an underground tunnel beneath the [[consulate]]. Seeing rival agent Krilencu (a man whom Bey says "kills for pleasure"), Bey takes Bond to  a rural gypsy settlement, where Bey plans to lay low while deciding how to deal with Krilencu. However the camp is attacked by  Krilencu's henchmen, who trigger gunfire and struggles with knives. Grant, lurking nearby, shoots a man who  nearly kills Bond. Despite being wounded in the attack, Bey kills Krilencu the next night with Bond's sniper rifle. When Bond returns to his hotel suite, he finds Romanova in bed waiting for him. Bond and Romanova make love, unaware that they are being filmed by Grant and Klebb. 

[[Image:FRWL_screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|Karim Bey gives Romanova and Bond their forged passports aboard the Orient Express]]
The next day, Romanova heads off for a pre-arranged rendezvous at the [[Hagia Sophia]]. Bond follows her and stalks the spectacled man who had followed him at the Istanbul airport. But unbeknown to Bond, the man is killed by Grant. When Bond finds the body, he  finds the floor plans for the Russian Consulate that Tatiania was smuggling out for him. Bey and Bond plan to the day to steal the Lektor and smuggle it back to England. On the appointed day, Bond enters the consulate lobby. Immediately, Bey sets off an explosive charge in the chamber beneath the building releasing tear gas. In the resulting chaos, Bond is able to find Romanova and flee with the Lektor on the Orient Express. Bey and a Soviet security officer Benz who recognises Romanova, also board the train, but Grant stealthily kills both of them.

The train continues on its journey across southern-central Europe, arriving at Belgrade where Bond arranges for an agent Nash from "Station 'Y'" to meet him at Zagreb. Grant intercepts the real Nash first, boards the train, and meets Bond impersonating the British operative. He drugs  Romanova at dinner with a knock out pill, then overcomes Bond in their cabin. Grant taunts him that SPECTRE has been pitting the Russians and the British against each other. Bond offers to buy his last cigarette for 50 gold sovereigns, luring Grant to open his attaché suitcase, which releases tear gas. In the ensuing fight, Bond stabs Grant with a knife and then uses Grant's  garrote wire to strangle him to death. At dawn, Bond and Romanova leave the train, hijack Grant's getaway truck and drive to a dock, eventually boarding a powerboat. Soon, they are chased by a fleet of SPECTRE's boats. When stray bullets puncture several barrels of fuel stored on his boat, Bond throws them overboard. Pretending to surrender,  he fires a [[Flare (pyrotechnic)|signal flare]] into the water, engulfing all the enemy boats in flames. 

Bond and Romanova reach Venice and check into a hotel, where Rosa Klebb, disguised as a maid, attempts to steal the Lektor. Klebb tries to kick Bond with her poison tipped toe-blade but is shot by Romanova. Riding in a [[gondola]], Bond throws the illicit film of him and Romanova into the canal, and they sail away.

{{Main|From Russia with Love (soundtrack)}}

From Russia with is the first Bond film in the series with [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] as the primary soundtrack composer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://restless.rimspace.net/soundtrack/fff/from_russia_with_love.htm|title="From Russia With Love" (1963) at Soundtrack Incomplete|accessdate=2007-07-28|publisher=Loki Carbis}}</ref> The theme song was composed by [[Lionel Bart]] of ''[[Oliver!]]'' fame and sung by [[Matt Monro]]<ref name="James Bond Theme">{{cite web|url=http://www.listology.com/content_show.cfm/content_id.10101|title=Listology: Rating the James Bond Theme Songs|accessdate=2007-07-28|publisher=Listology.com}}</ref>, although the title credit music is a lively instrumental version of the tune (segueing into "[[The James Bond Theme]]"). Monro's vocal version is later played during the film (as source music on a radio) and properly over the film's end titles.<ref name="James Bond Theme">{{cite web|url=http://www.listology.com/content_show.cfm/content_id.10101|title=Listology: Rating the James Bond Theme Songs|accessdate=2007-07-28}}</ref>

In this film, Barry introduced the percussive theme "[[James Bond music#007|007]]" – action music that came to be considered the 'secondary James Bond Theme'. The arrangement appears twice on the soundtrack album; the second version, entitled "007 Takes the Lektor", is the one used during the gunfight at the gypsy camp and also during Bond's theft of the Lektor decoding machine. The completed film features a holdover from the Monty Norman-supervised ''Dr. No'' music; the post-rocket-launch music from ''Dr. No'' is played in ''From Russia with Love'' during the helicopter and speedboat attacks.
