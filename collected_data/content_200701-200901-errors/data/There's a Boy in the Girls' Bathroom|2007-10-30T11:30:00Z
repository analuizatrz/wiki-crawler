'''''There's a Boy in the Girls' Bathroom''''' is a juvenile fiction book from the author [[Louis Sachar]]. The title comes from a point when the main character, Bradley, accidentally enters the girl's bathroom and is horribly embarressed by it. Later, a girl named Colleen enters the boys bathroom and is equally upset.

==Plot==

Bradley Chalkers is the [[protagonist]] of the book. In his school, his teachers and fellow classmates prefer to ignore him. He sits at the back of the class, last seat, last row, and never pays any attention, preferring to cut up pieces of paper or partake in other mindless tasks which keep his mind off the lesson. He is proud whenever he receives ''[[F]]'' on his class tests. He wants everyone to hate him, because then they will leave him alone.

But then a new classmate, Jeff Fishkin, comes in from [[Washington DC]], and the only remaining seat is beside Bradley. The classmate tries to reason with Bradley, but fails like everyone else and drifts away with other friends. Then a [[School Counselor|counselor]] is appointed called Carla, and she cannot wait to meet Bradley. Carla says she wants to be friends with Bradley, and she begins to try to open him up and reveal his kind interior which he has been trying to hide. But Bradley refuses to come quietly, and his conflicting emotions with Carla and other people induces strife [[has]] among his fellow schoolmates. As he meets with Carla, he slowly decides to become a better person. He does his homework and forms better relationships with his parents. To help him with a book report, Carla loans him a book she owns. Bradley thinks that the book is magical and responsible for his changes.

A subplot of the book involves Jeff and a girl named Colleen Verigold (described as having "red hair and a freckled face"), who seem to have crushes on each other. Bradley thinks girls are gross, and especially hates Colleen's best friend, the tomboyish Melinda Birch. At the beginning of the book, Bradley becomes irritated with Jeff for saying "Hi" to Colleen whenver she says "Hi" to him. Later, Carla tells Jeff and Colleen that Zen Buddhist monks are required to say "Hi" to each other when they meet. Later in the book, Bradley proves his friendship to Jeff by saying "Hi" to him. Towards the end of the book, as Carla helps Bradley change, he is invited to Colleen's birthday party along with Jeff (and he even wins the party games and gets a harmonica as a prize).

Unfortunately, Carla is not as popular with many parents of the students. Colleen's mother becomes angry with her for supposedly preaching religion (telling the students about the Zen Buddhist monks) and counseling Colleen without permission. As a result, Carla is fired and has to become a kindergarten teacher. When he hears this, Bradley becomes very upset and threatens to revert back to his original behavior. Although he misses saying goodbye to Carla, he does return to the school and finds a package she leaves for him. The package contains a goodbye note from her and her book. In the end, Bradley starts to come to terms with Carla's departure. He writes her a goodbye letter of his own and gives sends his most prized possession with it, a small china rabbit named Ronnie.
