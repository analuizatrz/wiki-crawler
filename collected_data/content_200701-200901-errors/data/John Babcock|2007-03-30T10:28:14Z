'''John F. Babcock''' (born [[July 23]], [[1900]]) is one of only two surviving veterans of the [[Canada|Canadian]] military to have served in the [[World War I|First World War]].

Babcock was born in [[Ontario]], and he was 15 when he joined the 146th Battalion of the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]]. A few months later, he arrived in [[England]]. John was transferred to reserve battalions, and in August [[1917]] he ended up with the Boys' Battalion (also known as the "Young Soldiers' Battalion"), waiting until he was old enough to go to the front lines. Before he could leave for the front, the war ended.

Babcock emigrated to the [[United States|US]] in the [[1920s]], and served briefly in the [[United States Army]] as well. He still lives with his wife Dorothy in [[Spokane, Washington]] at age 106.
