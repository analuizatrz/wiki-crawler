'''Electrical engineering''', sometimes referred to as '''electrical and electronic engineering''', is a field of [[engineering]] that deals with the study and application of [[electricity]], [[electronics]] and [[electromagnetism]]. The field first became an identifiable occupation in the late nineteenth century after commercialization of the electric [[telegraph]] and electrical power supply. It now covers a range of subtopics including [[power engineering|power]], [[electronics]], [[control systems]], [[signal processing]] and [[telecommunications]].

Electrical engineering may or may not include [[electronic engineering]]. Where a distinction is made, usually outside of the United States, electrical engineering is considered to deal with the problems associated with large-scale electrical systems such as [[Electric power transmission|power transmission]] and [[motor controller|motor control]], whereas electronic engineering deals with the study of small-scale electronic systems including [[computers]] and [[integrated circuits]].<ref>{{cite web | title = What is the difference between electrical and electronic engineering? | work = FAQs - Studying Electrical Engineering | url = http://www.ieee.org/organizations/eab/faqs1.htm | accessmonthday = 4 February | accessyear = 2005 }}</ref> Alternatively, electrical engineers are usually concerned with using electricity to transmit energy, while electronic engineers are concerned with using electricity to transmit information.

==History==
{{main|History of electrical engineering}}

[[Electricity]] has been a subject of scientific interest since at least the early 17th century. The first electrical engineer was probably [[William Gilbert]] who designed the [[versorium]]: a device that detected the presence of statically charged objects. He was also the first to draw a clear distinction between magnetism and static electricity and is credited with establishing the term electricity.<ref>{{cite web | title = William Gilbert (1544–1603) | work = Pioneers in Electricity | url = http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/pioneers/gilbert.html | accessmonthday = 13 May | accessyear = 2007 }}</ref> In 1775 [[Alessandro Volta]]'s scientific experimentations devised the [[electrophorus]], a device that produced a static electric charge, and by 1800  Volta developed the voltaic pile, a forerunner of the electric battery.<ref>Vaunt Design Group.

[[Image:Thomas Edison, 1878.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Thomas Edison]] built the world's first large-scale electrical supply network]]
However, it was not until the 19th century that research into the subject started to intensify. Notable developments in this century include the work of [[Georg Ohm]], who in 1827 quantified the relationship between the [[electric current]] and [[potential difference]] in a conductor, [[Michael Faraday]], the discoverer of [[electromagnetic induction]] in 1831, and [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who in 1873 published a unified [[Maxwell's equations|theory]] of electricity and [[magnetism]] in his treatise ''Electricity and Magnetism''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| ency = Encyclopedia Britannica | edition = 11 | year = 1911 | article = "Ohm, Georg Simon", "Faraday, Michael" and "Maxwell, James Clerk"}}</ref>

[[Image:N.Tesla.JPG|left|thumb|175px|[[Nikola Tesla]] made long-distance electrical transmission networks possible.]]  
During these years, the study of electricity was largely considered to be a subfield of [[physics]]. It was not until the late 19th century that [[university|universities]] started to offer [[academic degree|degrees]] in electrical engineering. The [[Darmstadt University of Technology]] founded the first chair and the first faculty of electrical engineering worldwide in 1882. In 1883 [[Darmstadt University of Technology]] and [[Cornell University]] introduced the world's first courses of study in electrical engineering, and in 1885 the [[University College London]] founded the first chair of electrical engineering in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web | title = Welcome to ECE! | work = Cornell University - School of Electrical and Computer Engineering | url = http://www.ece.cornell.edu | accessmonthday = 29 December | accessyear = 2005 }}</ref> The [[University of Missouri]] subsequently established the first department of electrical engineering in the United States in 1886.<ref>{{cite book | author = Ryder, John and Fink, Donald; | title = Engineers and Electrons | publisher = IEEE Press | year = 1984 | isbn = 0-87942-172-X }}</ref>

During this period, the work concerning electrical engineering increased dramatically. In 1882, [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] switched on the world's first large-scale electrical supply network that provided 110 volts [[direct current]] to fifty-nine customers in lower Manhattan. In 1887, [[Nikola Tesla]] filed a number of patents related to a competing form of power distribution known as [[alternating current]]. In the following years a bitter rivalry between Tesla and Edison, known as the "[[War of Currents]]", took place over the preferred method of distribution. AC eventually replaced DC for generation and power distribution, enormously extending the range and improving the safety and efficiency of power distribution.

The efforts of the two did much to further electrical engineering&mdash;Tesla's work on [[induction motor]]s and [[polyphase system]]s influenced the field for years to come, while Edison's work on telegraphy and his development of the [[stock ticker]] proved lucrative for his company, which ultimately became [[General Electric]]. However, by the end of the 19th century, other key figures in the progress of electrical engineering were beginning to emerge.<ref>{{cite web | title = History | work = National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) | url = http://www.nfpa.org/itemDetail.asp?categoryID=500&itemID=18020&URL=About%20Us/History | accessmonthday = 19 January | accessyear = 2006 }} ''(published 1996 in the NFPA Journal)''</ref>

===Modern developments===
; Emergence of radio and electronics
During the [[invention of radio|development of radio]], many scientists and [[inventor]]s contributed to [[radio|radio technology]] and electronics. In his classic [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] experiments of 1888, [[Heinrich Hertz]] transmitted (via a [[spark-gap transmitter]]) and detected [[radio waves]] using electrical equipment. In 1895, Nikola Tesla was able to detect signals from the transmissions of his New York lab at West Point (a distance of 80.4&nbsp;km / 49.95 miles).<ref>Leland Anderson, "''Nikola Tesla On His Work With Alternating Currents and Their Application to Wireless Telegraphy, Telephony, and Transmission of Power''", Sun Publishing Company, LC 92-60482, ISBN 0-9632652-0-2 (''ed''.

In 1895, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] furthered the art of hertzian wireless methods. Early on, he sent wireless signals over a distance of one and a half miles. In December 1901, he sent wireless waves that were not affected by the curvature of the Earth. Marconi later transmitted the wireless signals across the Atlantic between Poldhu, Cornwall, and St. John's, Newfoundland, a distance of {{convert|2100|mi|km}}.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1909/marconi-bio.html Marconi's biography at Nobelprize.org] retrieved 21 June 2008.</ref>
In 1920 [[Albert Hull]] developed the [[Cavity magnetron|magnetron]] which would eventually lead to the development of the [[microwave oven]] in 1946 by [[Percy Spencer]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Albert W.

In 1941 [[Konrad Zuse]] presented the [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]], the world's first fully functional and programmable computer.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Z3 | url = http://irb.cs.tu-berlin.de/~zuse/Konrad_Zuse/en/Rechner_Z3.html | accessmonthday = 18 January | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref> In 1946 the [[ENIAC]] (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) of [[John Presper Eckert]] and [[John Mauchly]] followed, beginning the computing era.

The invention of the transistor in 1947 by [[William B. Shockley]], [[John Bardeen]] and [[Walter Brattain]] opened the door for more compact devices and led to the development of the [[integrated circuit]] in 1958 by [[Jack Kilby]] and independently in 1959 by [[Robert Noyce]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Electronics Timeline | work = Greatest Engineering Achievements of the Twentieth Century | url = http://www.greatachievements.org/?id=3956 | accessmonthday = 18 January | accessyear = 2006 }}</ref>  In 1968 [[Marcian Hoff]] invented the first [[microprocessor]] at [[Intel]] and thus ignited the development of the [[personal computer]].

==Education==
{{main|Education and training of electrical and electronics engineers}}
Electrical engineers typically possess an [[academic degree]] with a major in electrical engineering. The length of study for such a degree is usually four or five years and the completed degree may be designated as a [[Bachelor of Engineering]], [[Bachelor of Science]], [[Bachelor of Technology]] or [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] depending upon the university. The degree generally includes units covering [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[project management]] and [[list of electrical engineering topics|specific topics in electrical engineering]]. Initially such topics cover most, if not all, of the sub-disciplines of electrical engineering. Students then choose to specialize in one or more sub-disciplines towards the end of the degree.

Some electrical engineers also choose to pursue a postgraduate degree such as a [[Master of Engineering]]/[[Master of Science]] (MEng/MSc), a Master of [[Engineering Management]], a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) in Engineering, an [[Engineering Doctorate]] (EngD), or an [[Engineer's degree]]. The Master and Engineer's degree may consist of either [[research]], [[coursework]] or a mixture of the two. The Doctor of Philosophy and Engineering Doctorate degrees consist of a significant research component and are often viewed as the entry point to [[academia]]. In the United Kingdom and various other European countries, the [[Master of Engineering]] is often considered an undergraduate degree of slightly longer duration than the [[Bachelor of Engineering]].<ref>Various including graduate degree requirements [http://www.eecs.mit.edu/grad/degrees.html at MIT], study guide [http://www.ecm.uwa.edu.au/study_guides/2007/be_bcompsc/ee at UWA], the curriculum [http://www.queensu.ca/calendars/appsci/pg174.html at Queen's] and unit tables [http://www.abdn.ac.uk/registry/calendar/requirements/07H50116.doc at Aberdeen]</ref>

==Practicing engineers==
In most countries, a Bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards [[professional certification]] and the degree program itself is certified by a [[professional body]]. After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements (including work experience requirements) before being certified. Once certified the engineer is designated the title of [[Professional Engineer]] (in the United States, Canada and South Africa ), [[Chartered Engineer]] (in India, the United Kingdom, Ireland and [[Zimbabwe]]), [[Chartered Professional Engineer]] (in Australia and New Zealand) or [[European Engineer]] (in much of the [[European Union]]).

The advantages of certification vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada "only a licensed engineer may seal engineering work for public and private clients".<ref>{{cite web | title = Why Should You Get Licensed? | work = National Society of Professional Engineers | url = http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp | accessmonthday = 11 July | accessyear = 2005 }}</ref> This requirement is enforced by state and provincial legislation such as [[Quebec|Quebec's]] Engineers Act.<ref>{{cite web | title = Engineers Act | work = Quebec Statutes and Regulations (CanLII) | url = http://www.canlii.org/qc/laws/sta/i-9/20050616/whole.html | accessmonthday = 24 July | accessyear = 2005 }}</ref> In other countries, such as Australia, no such legislation exists to practise engineering, however it is a mandate that if an engineer is to sign off or seal an engineering document or drawing then that person must be registered as a Certified Practising Engineer (or CPEng).<ref>{{cite web | title = Professional Engineers - Application | work = Engineers Australia | url = http://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/nerb/applying/professional-engineers.cfm | accessmonthday = 28 September | accessyear = 2008 }}</ref> Practically all certifying bodies maintain a [[code of ethics]] that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion.<ref>{{cite web | title = Codes of Ethics and Conduct | work = Online Ethics Center | url = http://onlineethics.org/CMS/profpractice/ethcodes.aspx | accessmonthday = 24 July | accessyear = 2005 }}</ref> In this way these organizations play an important role in maintaining ethical standards for the profession. Even in jurisdictions where certification has little or no legal bearing on work, engineers are subject to [[contract law]]. In cases where an engineer's work fails he or she may be subject to the [[negligence|tort of negligence]] and, in extreme cases, the charge of [[criminal negligence]]. An engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations such as [[building codes]] and legislation pertaining to [[environmental law]].

Professional bodies of note for electrical engineers include the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) and the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET) (which was formed by the merging of the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]] (IEE) and the [[Institution of Incorporated Engineers]] (IIE). The IEEE claims to produce 30% of the world's literature in electrical engineering, has over 360,000 members worldwide and holds over 3,000 conferences annually.<ref>{{cite web | title = About the IEEE | work = IEEE | url = http://www.ieee.org/about/ | accessmonthday = 11 July | accessyear = 2005 }}</ref> The IET publishes 21 journals, has a worldwide membership of over 150,000, and claims to be the largest professional engineering society in Europe.<ref>{{cite web | title = About the IET | work = The IET | url = http://www.theiet.org/about/ | accessmonthday = 11 July | accessyear = 2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Journal and Magazines | work = The IET | url = http://www.theiet.org/publishing/journals/ | accessmonthday = 11 July | accessyear = 2005 }}</ref> Obsolescence of technical skills is a serious concern for electrical engineers. Membership and participation in technical societies, regular reviews of periodicals in the field and a habit of continued learning are therefore essential to maintaining proficiency.<ref>{{cite web | title = Electrical and Electronics Engineers, except Computer | work = Occupational Outlook Handbook | url = http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm | accessmonthday = 16 July | accessyear = 2005 }} (see [[work of the United States Government|here]] regarding copyright)</ref>

In countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States electrical engineers make up around 0.25% of the labor force (see <span id="demographics_back">[[#demographics|note]]</span>). Outside of these countries, it is difficult to gauge the demographics of the profession due to less meticulous reporting on labor statistics. However, in terms of electrical engineering graduates per-capita, electrical engineering graduates would probably be most numerous in countries such as [[Taiwan]], Japan, India and South Korea.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = National Science Foundation | year = 2004 | url = http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind04/append/c2/at02-33.pdf | title = Science and Engineering Indicators 2004, Appendix 2-33 | format = PDF }}</ref>

==Tools and work==
From the [[Global Positioning System]] to [[electricity generation|electric power generation]], electrical engineers have contributed to the development of a wide range of technologies. They design, develop, test and supervise the deployment of electrical systems and electronic devices. For example, they may work on the design of [[telecommunication|telecommunication systems]], the operation of [[power station|electric power stations]], the [[lighting]] and [[electrical wiring|wiring]] of [[building]]s, the design of [[appliance|household appliances]] or the electrical [[control theory|control]] of industrial machinery.<ref>{{cite web | title = Electrical and Electronics Engineers, except Computer | work = Occupational Outlook Handbook | url = http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm | accessmonthday = 16 July | accessyear = 2005 }} (see [http://web.archive.org/web/www.bls.gov/oco/ocos031.htm Internet Archive])</ref>
[[Image:Navy-Radome.jpg|thumb|left|260px|[[Communications satellite|Satellite communications]] is one of many projects an electrical engineer might work on]]

Fundamental to the discipline are the sciences of [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] as these help to obtain both a [[qualitative]] and [[quantitative]] description of how such systems will work. Today most [[engineering]] work involves the use of [[computers]] and it is commonplace to use [[computer-aided design]] programs when designing electrical systems. Nevertheless, the ability to sketch ideas is still invaluable for quickly communicating with others.

Although most electrical engineers will understand basic [[circuit theory]] (that is the interactions of elements such as [[resistors]], [[capacitors]], [[diodes]], [[transistors]] and [[inductors]] in a circuit), the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work they do. For example, [[quantum mechanics]] and [[solid state physics]] might be relevant to an engineer working on [[VLSI]] (the design of integrated circuits), but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with macroscopic electrical systems. Even [[circuit theory]] may not be relevant to a person designing telecommunication systems that use [[commercial off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]] components. Perhaps the most important technical skills for electrical engineers are reflected in university programs, which emphasize [[numeracy|strong numerical skills]], [[computer literacy]] and the ability to understand the [[technical terminology|technical language and concepts]] that relate to electrical engineering.

For many engineers, technical work accounts for only a fraction of the work they do. A lot of time may also be spent on tasks such as discussing proposals with clients, preparing [[budget]]s and determining [[schedule (project management)|project schedules]].<ref>Trevelyan, James; (2005). ''What Do Engineers Really Do?''. University of Western Australia. (seminar with [http://www.mech.uwa.edu.au/jpt/Engineering%20Roles%20050503.pdf slides])</ref> Many senior engineers manage a team of [[technician]]s or other engineers and for this reason [[project management]] skills are important. Most engineering projects involve some form of documentation and [[technical writing|strong written communication]] skills are therefore very important.

The [[Office|workplaces]] of electrical engineers are just as varied as the types of work they do. Electrical engineers may be found in the pristine lab environment of a [[fabrication plant]], the offices of a [[consulting firm]] or on site at a [[mining|mine]]. During their working life, electrical engineers may find themselves supervising a wide range of individuals including [[scientist]]s, [[electrician]]s, [[computer programmers]] and other engineers.

==Sub-disciplines==
Electrical engineering has many sub-disciplines, the most popular of which are listed below. Although there are electrical engineers who focus exclusively on one of these sub-disciplines, many deal with a combination of them. Sometimes certain fields, such as electronic engineering and computer engineering, are considered separate disciplines in their own right.

===Power===
{{Main|Power engineering}}
[[Image:Power pole.jpg|right|150px|thumb]]
[[Power engineering]] deals with the [[electricity generation|generation]], [[electric power transmission|transmission]] and [[electricity distribution|distribution]] of [[electricity]] as well as the design of a range of related devices. These include [[transformer]]s, [[electric generator]]s, [[electric motor]]s, high voltage engineering and [[power electronics]]. In many regions of the world, governments maintain an electrical network called a [[power grid]] that connects a variety of generators together with users of their energy. Users purchase electrical energy from the grid, avoiding the costly exercise of having to generate their own. Power engineers may work on the design and maintenance of the power grid as well as the power systems that connect to it. Such systems are called ''on-grid'' power systems and may supply the grid with additional power, draw power from the grid or do both. Power engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid, called ''off-grid'' power systems, which in some cases are preferable to on-grid systems. The future includes Satellite controlled power systems, with feedback in real time to prevent power surges and prevent blackouts.

===Control===
{{Main|Control engineering}}
[[Image:Space Shuttle Columbia launching.jpg|left|170px|thumb|[[Control systems]] play a critical role in [[space flight]]]]
[[Control engineering]] focuses on the [[mathematical model|modeling]] of a diverse range of [[dynamic system]]s and the design of [[controller (control theory)|controllers]] that will cause these systems to behave in the desired manner. To implement such controllers electrical engineers may use [[Electronic circuit|electrical circuits]], [[digital signal processing|digital signal processors]], [[microcontroller]]s and [[Programmable logic controller|PLCs]] (Programmable Logic Controllers). [[Control engineering]] has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of [[Airliner|commercial airliners]] to the [[cruise control]] present in many modern [[automobile]]s. It also plays an important role in [[industrial automation]].

Control engineers often utilize [[feedback]] when designing [[control system]]s. For example, in an [[automobile]] with [[cruise control]] the vehicle's [[speed]] is continuously monitored and fed back to the system which adjusts the [[Internal combustion engine|motor's]] [[Power (physics)|power]] [[output]] accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, [[control theory]] can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback.

===Electronics===
{{Main|Electronic engineering}}
[[Image:PExdcr01CJC.jpg|right|185px|thumb|[[circuit board]]]]
[[Electronic engineering]] involves the design and testing of [[electronic circuit]]s that use the properties of [[electrical element|components]] such as [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, [[diode]]s and [[transistor]]s to achieve a particular functionality. The [[tuned circuit]], which allows the user of a [[radio]] to [[electronic filter|filter]] out all but a single station, is just one example of such a circuit. Another example (of a pneumatic signal conditioner) is shown in the adjacent photograph.

Prior to the second world war, the subject was commonly known as ''radio engineering'' and basically was restricted to aspects of communications and [[radar]], [[radio|commercial radio]] and [[television|early television]]. Later, in post war years, as consumer devices began to be developed, the field grew to include modern television, audio systems, [[computer]]s and [[microprocessors]]. In the mid to late 1950s, the term ''radio engineering'' gradually gave way to the name ''electronic engineering''.

Before the invention of the [[integrated circuit]] in 1959, electronic circuits were constructed from discrete components that could be manipulated by humans. These discrete circuits consumed much space and [[electric power|power]] and were limited in speed, although they are still common in some applications. By contrast, [[integrated circuit]]s packed a large number&mdash;often millions&mdash;of tiny electrical components, mainly [[transistor]]s, into a small chip around the size of a [[coin]]. This allowed for the powerful [[computer]]s and other electronic devices we see today.

===Microelectronics===
{{Main|Microelectronics}}

[[Image:80486dx2-large.jpg|left|185px|thumb|[[Microprocessor]]]]
[[Microelectronics]] engineering deals with the design and [[microfabrication]] of very small electronic circuit components for use in an [[integrated circuit]] or sometimes for use on their own as a general electronic component. The most common microelectronic components are [[semiconductor]] [[transistors]], although all main electronic components ([[resistors]], [[capacitors]], [[inductors]]) can be created at a microscopic level.

Microelectronic components are created by chemically fabricating wafers of semiconductors such as silicon (at higher frequencies, [[compound semiconductor]]s like gallium arsenide and indium phosphide) to obtain the desired transport of electronic charge and control of current. The field of microelectronics involves a significant amount of chemistry and material science and requires the electronic engineer working in the field to have a very good working knowledge of the effects of [[quantum mechanics]].

===Signal processing===
[[Image:Bayer pattern on sensor.svg|thumb|A [[Bayer filter]] on a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] requires signal processing to get a red, green, and blue value at each pixel]]
{{Main|Signal processing}}
[[Signal processing]] deals with the analysis and manipulations of [[signal (information theory)|signals]]. Signals can be either [[analog signal|analog]], in which case the signal varies continuously according to the information, or [[digital signal|digital]], in which case the signal varies according to a series of discrete values representing the information. For analog signals, signal processing may involve the [[amplifier|amplification]] and [[Electronic filter|filtering]] of audio signals for audio equipment or the [[modulation]] and [[demodulation]] of signals for [[telecommunication]]s. For digital signals, signal processing may involve the [[Data compression|compression]], [[error detection]] and [[error correction]] of digitally sampled signals.

Signal Processing is a very mathematically oriented and intensive area forming the core of [[Digital Signal Processing]]   ([[DSP]]) and it is rapidly expanding with new applications in every field of electrical engineering such as communications, control, radar, TV/Audio/Video engineering, power electronics and bio-medical engineering as many already existing analog systems are replaced with their digital counterparts. 

Although in the classical era, [[analog signal processing]] only provided a mathematical description of a system to be designed, which is actually implemented by the [[analog hardware]] engineers, Digital Signal Processing both provides a mathematical description of the systems to be designed and also actually implements them (either by software programming or by hardware embedding) without much dependency on hardware issues, which exponentiates the importance and success of DSP engineering.

The deep and strong relations between signals and the information they carry, makes signal processing equivalent of information processing. Which is the reason why the field finds so many diversified applications. DSP processor ICs are found in every type of modern electronic systems and products including, [[SDTV]] | [[HDTV]] sets, radios and mobile communication devices, [[Hi-Fi]] audio equipments, [[Dolby]] [[noise reduction]] algorithms, [[GSM]] mobile phones, [[mp3]] multimedia players, camcorders and digital cameras, automobile control systems, [[noise cancelling]] headphones, digital [[spectrum analyzer]]s, intelligent missile guidance, [[radar]], [[GPS]] based cruize control systems and all kinds of [[image processing]], [[video processing]], [[audio processing]] and  [[speech processing]] systems...Just to mention a few of the possibly much more.

===Telecommunications===
{{Main|Telecommunications engineering}}
[[Image:Milstar.jpg|left|200px|thumb]]
[[Telecommunications|Telecommunications engineering]] focuses on the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[information]] across a [[channel (communications)|channel]] such as a [[coax cable]], [[optical fiber]] or [[free space]]. Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a [[carrier wave]] in order to shift the information to a [[carrier frequency]] suitable for transmission, this is known as [[modulation]]. Popular analog modulation techniques include [[amplitude modulation]] and [[frequency modulation]]. The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer.

Once the transmission characteristics of a system are determined, telecommunication engineers design the [[transmitter]]s and [[receiver (radio)|receivers]] needed for such systems. These two are sometimes combined to form a two-way communication device known as a [[transceiver]]. A key consideration in the design of transmitters is their [[power consumption]] as this is closely related to their [[signal strength]]. If the signal strength of a transmitter is insufficient the signal's information will be corrupted by [[signal noise|noise]].

===Instrumentation===
{{Main|Instrumentation engineering}}
[[Image:radar gun.jpg|right|190px|thumb|[[Radar gun]]]]
[[Instrumentation engineering]] deals with the design of devices to measure physical quantities such as [[pressure]], [[flow]] and [[temperature]]. The design of such instrumentation requires a good understanding of [[physics]] that often extends beyond [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic theory]]. For example, [[radar gun]]s use the [[Doppler effect]] to measure the speed of oncoming vehicles. Similarly, [[thermocouple]]s use the [[Peltier-Seebeck effect]] to measure the temperature difference between two points.

Often instrumentation is not used by itself, but instead as the [[sensor]]s of larger electrical systems. For example, a thermocouple might be used to help ensure a furnace's temperature remains constant. For this reason, instrumentation engineering is often viewed as the counterpart of control engineering.

===Computers===
{{Main|Computer engineering}}
[[Image:PDA.jpg|left|140px|thumb|[[Personal digital assistant]]]]

[[Computer engineering]] deals with the design of [[computer]]s and [[computer system]]s. This may involve the design of new [[hardware]], the design of [[personal digital assistant|PDAs]] or the use of computers to control an [[manufacturing|industrial plant]]. Computer engineers may also work on a system's [[software]]. However, the design of complex software systems is often the domain of [[software engineering]], which is usually considered a separate discipline. [[Desktop computer]]s represent a tiny fraction of the devices a computer engineer might work on, as computer-like architectures are now found in a range of devices including [[video game console]]s and [[DVD player]]s.

==Related disciplines==
[[Mechatronics]] is an engineering discipline which deals with the convergence of electrical and [[machine|mechanical]] systems. Such combined systems are known as [[electromechanical]] systems and have widespread adoption. Examples include [[automation|automated manufacturing systems]], [[HVAC|heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems]] and various subsystems of [[aircraft]] and [[automobile]]s.

The term ''mechatronics'' is typically used to refer to [[macroscopic]] systems but [[Futures studies|futurists]] have predicted the emergence of very small electromechanical devices. Already such small devices, known as [[MEMS|micro electromechanical systems]] (MEMS), are used in automobiles to tell [[airbag]]s when to deploy, in [[digital projector]]s to create sharper images and in [[inkjet printer]]s to create nozzles for high definition printing. In the future it is hoped the devices will help build tiny implantable medical devices and improve [[optical communication]].<ref>{{cite web | title = MEMS the world! | work = IntelliSense Software Corporation | url = http://www.intellisensesoftware.com/Technology.html | accessmonthday = 17 July | accessyear = 2005 }}</ref>

[[Biomedical engineering]] is another related discipline, concerned with the design of [[medical equipment]]. This includes fixed equipment such as [[ventilator]]s, [[MRI|MRI scanners]] and [[electrocardiograph|electrocardiograph monitors]] as well as mobile equipment such as [[cochlear implant]]s, [[artificial pacemaker]]s and [[artificial heart]]s.
