The '''Battle of Greece''' (also known as '''Operation Marita''', {{lang-de|Unternehmen Marita}})<ref name="C3-4">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/CMH/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 82]</ref> was a [[World War II]] battle that occurred on the Greek mainland and in southern [[Albania]]. The battle was fought between the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] ([[Greece]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]) and [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] ([[Nazi Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Bulgaria]]) forces. With the [[Battle of Crete]] and several naval actions, the Battle of Greece is considered part of the wider [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] component of the [[Balkans Campaign]] of [[World War II]].

The Battle of Greece is generally regarded as a continuation of the [[Greco-Italian War]], which began when Italian troops invaded Greece on [[October 28]], [[1940]]. Within weeks the Italians were driven from Greece and Greek forces pushed on to occupy much of southern [[Albania]]. In March 1941, a major Italian counterattack failed, and Germany was forced to come to the aid of its ally. Operation Marita began on [[April 6]], [[1941]], with German troops invading Greece through [[Bulgaria]] in an effort to secure its southern flank. The combined Greek and British forces fought back with great tenacity, but were vastly outnumbered and outgunned, and finally collapsed. [[Athens]] fell on [[April 27]]. However, the British Commonwealth managed to evacuate  about 50,000 troops.{{Cref|a}} The Greek campaign ended in a quick and complete German victory with the fall of [[Kalamata]] in the [[Peloponnese]]; it was over within twenty-four days.  Nevertheless, both German and Allied officials have expressed their admiration for the strong resistance of the Greek soldiers.

Some historians regard the German campaign in Greece as decisive in determining the course of World War II, maintaining that it fatally delayed the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Axis invasion of the Soviet Union]]. Others hold that the campaign had no influence on the launching of [[Operation Barbarossa]], and characterize British intervention in Greece as a hopeless undertaking, a "political and sentimental decision" or even a "definite strategic blunder."

At the outbreak of World War II, [[Ioannis Metaxas]], the [[Prime Minister of Greece]], sought to maintain a position of [[Neutral country|neutrality]]. However, Greece was increasingly subject to pressures from Italy, which culminated in the Italian submarine ''Delfino'''s torpedoing of the Greek cruiser ''[[Greek cruiser Elli|Elli]]'' on [[August 15]], [[1940]].<ref name="H">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Greece, History of|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia "The Helios"}}</ref> Mussolini was irritated that [[Nazi]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]] had not consulted with him on his war policy, and wished to establish his independence,{{Cref|b}} and to match the military success of the Germans through a victorious attack on Greece, a country he regarded as an easy opponent.<ref name="BG">Buckley (1984), 18<br />* Goldstein (1992), 53</ref> On [[October 15]], [[1940]], Mussolini and his closest advisers decided to invade Greece.{{Cref|c}} In the early hours of [[October 28]], Italian Ambassador [[Emmanuel Grazzi]] presented Metaxas with a three-hour ultimatum, in which he demanded free passage for troops to occupy unspecified "strategic sites" within Greek territory.<ref name="B17">Buckley (1984), 17</ref> Metaxas rejected the ultimatum (the refusal is commemorated as [[Okhi Day]], a national holiday in Greece), but even before its expiration, Italian troops had invaded Greece through Albania.{{Cref|d}} The principal Italian thrust was directed at [[Pindus]], near the city of [[Ioannina]], and initially made progress.

After weeks of inconclusive winter warfare, the Italians launched a full-scale counterattack across the entire front on [[March 9]], [[1941]], which, despite the superiority of the Italian armed forces, failed. After one week and 12,000 casualties, Mussolini called off the counterattack, and left Albania twelve days later.<ref name="BB">Bailey (1984), 22<br />* [http://www.onwar.com/chrono/1941/mar41/f16mar41.htm More U-boat Aces Hunted down], OnWar.Com</ref> Modern analysts believe that the Italian campaign failed because Mussolini and his generals initially allocated meagre military resources to the campaign (an expeditionary force of 55,000 men),<ref>Richter(1998), 119</ref> failed to reckon with the autumn weather, and launched an attack without the advantage of surprise and without the support of the [[Bulgarians]].<ref name="R29">Creveld (1972), 41<br />* Rodogno (2006), 29–30</ref> Even elementary precautions, such as the issue of winter clothing had not been taken.<ref name="N165">Neville (2003), 165</ref> Nor had Mussolini taken into consideration the recommendations of the Italian Commission of War Production, which had warned that Italy would not be able to sustain a full year of continuous warfare until 1949.<ref name="L146">Lee (2000), 146</ref>

During the six month fight against Italy, the Greek army made local gains by eliminating enemy [[salient]]s. Nevertheless, Greece did not have a substantial armaments industry, and both its equipment and ammunition supplies relied on stocks captured by British forces from defeated Italian armies in [[North Africa]]. In order to feed the battle in Albania, the Greek command was forced to make withdrawals from [[Macedonia (Greece)|Eastern Macedonia]] and [[Western Thrace]]. Anticipation of a German attack expedited the need to reverse the position; the available forces were proving unable to sustain resistance on both fronts. The Greek command decided to support its success in Albania, regardless of how the situation might develop under the impact of a German attack from the [[Bulgaria]]n border.<ref name="C72">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 70–71]</ref>

Hitler intervened on [[November 4]], [[1940]], four days after the [[Britons|British]] took both [[Crete]] and [[Lemnos]]. The [[Führer]] ordered his Army General Staff to prepare for an invasion of Northern Greece via Romania and Bulgaria. His plans for this campaign were incorporated into a master plan aimed at depriving the British of their [[Mediterranean]] bases.<ref name="CHel">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_1.htm 5–7]<br />* {{cite encyclopedia|title=Greece, History of|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia "The Helios"}}</ref> On [[November 12]], the German [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|Armed Forces High Command]] issued Directive No. 18, in which they scheduled simultaneous operations against [[Gibraltar]] and Greece for the following January.

The Armed Forces High Command issued Directive No. 20 on [[December 13]], [[1940]].

On [[November 17]], [[1940]], Metaxas proposed to the British government the undertaking of a joint offensive in the Balkans with the Greek strongholds in South Albania as the base of the operations. The British side however was reluctant to discuss Metaxas' proposal, because the deployment of the troops the implementation of the Greek plan demanded would seriously endanger the Commonwealth military operations in North Africa.<ref name="Sv"> Svolopoulos (1997), 285, 288</ref> During a meeting of British and Greek military and political leaders in [[Athens]] on [[January 13]], [[1941]] [[strategos|General]] [[Alexandros Papagos]], [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Hellenic Army]], asked Britain for nine fully-equipped divisions and corresponding air support. The British responded that, because of their commitment to the fight in North Africa, and all they could offer was the immediate dispatch of a small token force of less than divisional strength. This offer was rejected by the Greeks who feared that the arrival of such a contingent would precipitate a German attack without giving them any sizable assistance.{{Cref|e}} British help would be requested if and when German troops crossed the Danube from Romania into Bulgaria.<ref name="BC">Beevor (1992), 38<br />* Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 71–72]</ref>

Churchill held to his ambition to recreate a Balkan Front comprising Yugoslavia, Greece and [[Turkey]],<ref name="C1992" /> and ordered [[Anthony Eden]] and Sir [[John Dill]] to resume negotiations with the Greek government. A meeting attended by Eden and the Greek leadership, including King [[George II of Greece|George II]], Prime Minister [[Alexandros Koryzis]]&mdash;the successor of Metaxas, who had died on [[January 29]], [[1941]]&mdash;and Papagos took place in [[Athens]] on [[February 22]].

==Military preparations==
===Topography===
To enter Northern Greece, the German army was compelled to cross the [[Rhodope mountains]], which possessed few river valleys or passes capable of accommodating the movement of large military units. Two invasion courses were located west of [[Kyustendil]]; another was along the Yugoslav-Bulgarian border, via the [[Strimon]] valley to the south. Greek border fortifications had been adapted for the terrain, and a formidable defense system covered the few available roads. The Strimon and [[Nestos River|Nestos]] rivers cut across the mountain range along the Greek-Bulgarian frontier, and both of their valleys were protected by strong fortifications, as part of the larger [[Metaxas Line]]. This system of concrete pillboxes and field fortifications  was constructed along the Bulgarian border in the late 1930s, and was based on principles similar to those applied to the [[Maginot Line]]. Its strength resided mainly in the inaccessibility of the intermediate terrain leading up to the defense positions.<ref name="CB75">Bailey (1979), 37<br />* Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 75]</ref>

===Strategic factors===
The mountainous terrain of Greece favored a defensive strategy, and the high ranges of the Rhodope, [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], [[Pindus]], and [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] mountains offered many opportunities to stop an invader. However, sufficient air power was required to prevent defending ground forces from becoming trapped in the many [[defile (geography)|defile]]s. Although an invading force from Albania can be stopped by a relatively small number of troops positioned in the high Pindus mountains, the northeastern part of the country was difficult to defend against an attack from the north.<ref name="CB77">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 77]</ref>

Following a conference in Athens that March, the British command believed that they would combine with Greek forces to occupy the [[Haliacmon Line]]&mdash;a short front facing northeastward along the [[Vermion Mountains]], and the lower [[Haliacmon]] river. Papagos awaited clarification from the Yugoslav government, and later proposed to hold the Metaxas Line&mdash;by then a symbol of national security to the Greek populace&mdash;and not withdraw any of his divisions from Albania.<ref name="PMc">McClymont (1959), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c6-11.html 106–107]<br />* Papagos (1949), 115<br />* Ziemke, [http://www.grolier.com/wwii/wwii_7.html Balkan Campaigns]</ref> He argued that to do so would be seen as a concession of victory to the Italians. The strategically important port of [[Thessaloniki]] lay practically indefensible, and transportation of British troops to the city remained dangerous.<ref name="Mc106-107">McClymont (1959), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c6-11.html 106–107]</ref> Papagos proposed to take advantage of the area's difficult terrain and prepare fortifications, while at the same time protecting Thessaloniki.
[[Image:Churchill-in-quebec-1944-23-0201a.gif|thumb|Winston Churchill believed it was vital for the UK to take every measure possible to support Greece. On [[January 8]], [[1941]], he stated that "there was no other course open to us but to make certain that we had spared no effort to help the Greeks who had shown themselves so worthy."<ref name="L191-192">Lawlor (1994), 191–192</ref>]]
General Dill described Papagos' attitude as "unaccommodating and defeatist",<ref name="L168">Lawlor (1994), 168</ref> and argued that his plan disregarded the fact that Greek troops and artillery were capable of only token resistance. The British believed that the Greek rivalry with Bulgaria&mdash;the Metaxas line was designed specifically for use in the event of war with Bulgaria&mdash;as well as their traditionally good terms with the Yugoslavs, left their north-western border largely undefended.<ref name="B37">Bailey (1979), 37</ref> Despite their concerns over the vulnerability of the border system, and their awareness that it was likely to collapse in the event of a German thrust from the Strimon and [[Axios River|Axios]] rivers, the British eventually conceded to the Greek command. On [[March 4]], Dill accepted the plans for the Metaxas line, and on [[March 7]], agreement was ratified by the [[British Cabinet]].<ref name="LM">Lawlor (1994), 168<br />* McClymont (1959), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c6-11.html 107–108]</ref> The overall command was to be retained by Papagos, and the Greek and British commands resigned themselves to fighting a delaying action in the northeastern part of the country.<ref name="CB77" /> Nevertheless, the British did not move their troops, because General Wilson regarded them as too weak to maintain such a broad front line. Instead, he took a position some forty miles west of the Axios, across the Haliacmon Line.<ref name="Zi">Svolopoulos (1997), 290<br />* Ziemke, [http://www.grolier.com/wwii/wwii_7.html Balkan Campaigns]</ref> The two main objectives in establishing this position were to maintain contact with the Greek First Army in Albania, and to deny German access to Central Greece. This had the advantage of requiring a smaller force than other options, while still allowing more time for preparation. However, it meant abandoning nearly the whole of Northern Greece, and was thus unacceptable to the Greeks for both political and psychological reasons. Moreover, the left flank of the line was susceptible to flanking from Germans operating through the [[Monastir]] gap in Yugoslavia.<ref>Buckley (1979), p. 40–45</ref> However, the possibility of a rapid disintegration of the Yugoslav Army, and a German thrust into the rear of the [[Vermio]]n position, was not taken into consideration.<ref name="CB77" />

The German strategy was based on utilization of the [[blitzkrieg]] tactics which had proved successful during the invasions of Western Europe, and confirmed their effectiveness during the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]]. The German command planned to couple an attack of ground troops and tanks with support from the air, and make a rapid thrust into the territory. Once Thessaloniki was captured, Athens and the port of [[Piraeus]] would be the next principal targets. With Piraeus and the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] in German hands, the withdrawal and evacuation of British and Greek forces would be fatally compromised.<ref name="CB77" />

===Defense and attack forces===

The Fifth Yugoslav Army was given responsibility for the defense of the southeastern border between [[Kriva Palanka]] and the Greek border. At the time of the German attack, the Yugoslav troops were not yet fully mobilized, and lacked a sufficient amount of modern equipment or weapons to be fully effective. Following the entry of German forces into Bulgaria, the majority of Greek troops were evacuated from [[Western Thrace]]. By this time, the total strength of the Greek forces defending the Bulgarian border totaled roughly 70,000 men, under the command of the Greek Second Army. The remainder of the Greek forces&mdash;the [[First Army (Greece)|First Army]], composed of fourteen divisions&mdash;was committed in Albania.<ref name="CB79">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 79]</ref> 

On [[March 28]], the Greek forces in Central Macedonia&mdash;the 12th and 20th Infantry Divisions&mdash;were put under the command of General Wilson, who established his headquarters northwest of [[Larissa]]. The New Zealand division took a position north of Mount Olympus, while the Australian division blocked the Haliacmon valley up to the Vermion range. The Royal Air Force continued to operate from airfields in Central and Southern Greece; however, few planes could be diverted to the theater. The British forces were near to fully motorized, but their equipment was more suited to desert warfare than to the steep mountain roads of Greece. There was a shortage of tanks and anti-aircraft guns, and the lines of communication across the Mediterranean were vulnerable, because each convoy had to pass close to enemy-held islands in the Aegean; despite the fact that the British Navy dominated the [[Aegean Sea]]. These [[Logistics|logistical]] problems were aggravated by the limited availability of shipping and capacity of the Greek ports.<ref name="CB79-80">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 79–80]</ref> 

The [[German Twelfth Army]], under the command of [[Field Marshal]] [[Wilhelm List]], was charged with the execution of Operation Marita. His army was composed of six units:
#First Panzer Group, under the command of General Ewald van Kleist.
#[[XL Panzer Corps]], under Lieutenant General [[Georg Stumme]].
#XVIII Mountain Corps, under Lieutenant General [[Franz Böhme]].
#XXX Infantry Corps, under Lieutenant General Otto Hartmann.
#L Infantry Corps, under Lieutenant General [[Georg Lindemann]].
#16th Panzer Division, deployed behind the Turkish-Bulgarian border to support the Bulgarian forces in case of a Turkish attack.<ref name="CB81">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 81]</ref>

===German plan of attack and assembly===
The German plan of attack was informed by their army's experiences during the [[Battle of France]]. Their strategy was to create a diversion through the campaign in Albania, thus stripping the Greek Army of sufficient manpower for the defense of their Yugoslavian and Bulgarian borders. By driving armored wedges through the weakest links of the defense chain, the ability to penetrate into enemy territory would be more easily achieved, and would not necessitate the maneuver of their armor behind an infantry advance. Once the weak defense system of Southern Yugoslavia were overrun by German armor, the Metaxas Line could be outflanked by highly mobile forces thrusting southward from Yugoslavia. Thus possession of Monastir and the Axios valley leading to Thessaloniki became essential for such an outflanking maneuver.<ref name="CB82-83">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 82&ndash;83]</ref>

The Yugoslav coup d'etat led to a sudden change in the plan of attack, and confronted the Twelfth Army with a number of difficult problems. According to the March 28 Directive No. 25, the Twelfth Army was to regroup its forces in such a manner that a mobile task force would be available to attack via [[Niš]] toward [[Belgrade]]. With only nine days left before [[D-Day]], every hour became valuable, and each fresh assembly of troops would need time to mobilize. By the evening of [[April 5]], each attack force intended to enter either Southern Yugoslavia or Greece had been assembled.<ref name="CB83-84">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 83–84]</ref>

==German invasion==
===Thrust across Southern Yugoslavia and drive to Thessaloniki===
[[Image:Battle of Greece - 9 April 1941.png|thumb|German advance until [[April 9]], [[1941]], when the 2nd Panzer Division seized Thessaloniki.]]
On the dawn of [[April 6]], the German armies invaded Greece, while the [[Luftwaffe]] began an intensive bombardment of [[Belgrade]]. The XL Panzer Corps&mdash;which had been intended for use in an attack across southern Yugoslavia&mdash;began their assault at 05:30 a.m., and made thrusts across the Bulgarian frontier at two separate points. By the evening of [[April 8]], the [[1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler|1st SS Division Adolf Hitler]] captured [[Prilep]], thus severing an important rail line between Belgrade and Thessaloniki, and isolating Yugoslavia from its allies. The Germans were now in possession of terrain which was favorable to the continuation of the offensive. On the evening of [[April 9]], General Stumme deployed his forces north of Monastir, in preparation for the extension of the attack across the Greek border toward [[Florina]]. This position threatened to encircle the Greeks in Albania and W Force in the area of Florina, [[Edessa, Greece|Edessa]], and [[Katerini]].<ref name="Mc160">McClymont (1959), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c8-2.html 160]</ref> While weak security detachments covered the rear of his corps against a surprise attack from central Yugoslavia, elements of the [[9th Panzer Division]] drove westward to link up with the Italians at the Albanian border.<ref name="CB86">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 86]</ref> 

The [[German 2nd Panzer Division|2nd Panzer Division]] (XVIII Mountain troops) entered Yugoslavia from the east on the morning of April 6, and advanced westward through the Strimon Valley. It encountered little enemy resistance, but was delayed by road clearance demolitions, [[land mine]]s, and muddy roads. Nevertheless, the division was able to reach the objective of the day, the town of [[Strumica]]. On [[April 7]], a Yugoslav counter attack against the northern flank of the division was repelled, and the following day the division forced its way across the mountains and overran the Greek 19th Motorized Infantry Division Units stationed south of [[Dojran Lake|Doiran]] lake. Despite many delays along the narrow mountain roads, an armored advance guard dispatched in the direction of Thessaloniki succeeded in entering the city by the morning of April 9. The seizure of Thessaloniki took place without struggle, following the collapse of the Greek Second Army.<ref name="CB87">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 87]</ref>

===Metaxas Line===
[[Image:Greek surrender 1941.jpg|thumb|Greek soldiers leaving their positions after the surrender of the Greek Army in Macedonia. In the front, a Greek and a Bulgarian soldier support a wounded Greek.]]
The Metaxas Line was defended by the [[Hellenic Army IV Army Corps|Eastern Macedonia Army Section]], which comprised the 7th, 14th and 17th Infantry Divisions under the command of Lieutenant General Konstantinos Bakopoulos. The line ran for c.170 km along the river Nestos to the east, and then to the east following the Bulgarian border as far as [[Belasica|Mount Beles]] near the Yugoslav border. The fortifications were designed to garrison an army of over 200,000 troops, but due to a lack of available manpower, the actual number was roughly 70,000. As a result of the low numbers, the line's defenses were thinly spread.<ref>Buckley, p. 30–33</ref>

The initial German attacks against the line were undertaken by a single German infantry unit reinforced by two mountain divisions of the XVIII Mountain Corps. These first forces encountered strong resistance, and had limited success.<ref name="BCB">Buckley (1984), 50<br />* Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 88]</ref> A German report at the end of the first day described how the [[German 5th Mountain Division]] "was repulsed in the Rupel Pass despite strongest air support and sustained considerable casualties".<ref>Beevor (1991), 33</ref> Of the twenty-four forts which made up the Metaxas Line, only two had fallen, and then only after they had been destroyed.<ref name="B50">Buckley (1984), 50</ref> 

The line was penetrated following a three-day struggle during which the Germans pummeled the forts with [[artillery]] and [[dive bomber]]s. The main credit for this achievement must be given to the [[German 6th Mountain Division|6th Mountain Division]], which crossed a {{convert|7000|ft|m|sing=on}} snow-covered mountain range and broke through at a point that had been considered inaccessible by the Greeks. The force reached the rail line to Thessaloniki on the evening of April 7. The other XVIII Mountain Corps units advanced step by step under great hardship. The 5th Division, together with the reinforced 125th Infantry Regiment, penetrated the Strimon defenses on April 7, and attacked along both banks of the river,  clearing one bunker after another as they passed. Nevertheless the unit suffered heavy casualties, to the extent that it was withdrawn from further action after it had reached its objective location. The 72d Infantry Division advanced from [[Gotse Delchev (town)|Nevrokop]] across the mountains, and, although it was handicapped by a shortage of pack animals, medium artillery, and mountain equipment, it managed to break through the Metaxas Line on the evening of April 9, when it reached the area northeast of [[Serres, Greece|Serres]].<ref name="CB88">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 88]</ref> Even after General Bakopoulos surrendered the Metaxas Line, isolated fortresses held out for days, and were not taken until heavy artillery was utilised against them. Some field troops and soldiers manning the frontier continued to fight on, and as a result a number were able to evacuate by sea.<ref>Buckley (1984), 61<br />* Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 89]</ref>

===Capitulation of the Greek Second Army===
The XXX Infantry Corps on the left wing reached its designated objective on the evening of [[April 8]], when the 164th Infantry Division captured [[Xanthi]]. The 50th Infantry Division advanced far beyond [[Komotini]] towards the Nestos river, which both divisions reached on the next day. On April 9, the Greek Second Army capitulated unconditionally following the collapse of Greek resistance east of the Axios river. In an April 9 estimate of the situation, Field Marshal List expressed the opinion that as a result of the swift advance of the mobile units, his 12th Army was now in a favorable position to gain access to Central Greece by breaking the enemy buildup behind the Axios river. On the basis of this estimate List requested the transfer of the 5th Panzer Division from First Panzer Group to the XL Panzer Corps. He reasoned that its presence would give additional punch to the German thrust through the Monastir gap. For the continuation of the campaign he formed two attack groups, an eastern one under the command of XVIII Mountain Corps, and a western group led by [[XL Panzer Corps]].<ref name="CB89-91">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 89–91]</ref>

===Breakthrough to Kozani===
{{seealso|Battle of Vevi (1941)}}
[[Image:Allied dispositions, Florina Valley.jpg|thumb|The dispositions of forces in the Florina Valley, [[April 10]], [[1941]].

By the morning of [[April 10]], the XL Panzer Corps had finished its preparations for the continuation of the offensive, and continued the advance in the direction of [[Kozani]]. Against all expectations, the Monastir gap had been left open, and the Germans exploited their chance. First contact with Allied troops was made north of [[Vevi]] at 11:00 a.m. on April 10. SS troops seized [[Vevi]] on [[April 11]], but were stopped at the [[Klidi Pass]] just south of the town, where a mixed Commonwealth-Greek formation, known as [[Iven Giffard Mackay|Mackay]] Force, was assembled to, as Wilson put it, "....stop a blitzkrieg down the Florina valley."<ref>[http://www.ww2australia.gov.au/greatrisk/greatrisk05.html The Roof is Leaking], Australian Department of Veterans' Affairs</ref> During the next day the SS regiment reconnoitered the enemy positions, and at dusk launched a frontal attack against the pass. Following heavy fighting, the Germans overcame the enemy resistance, and broke through the defense.<ref name="CB91">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 91]</ref> By the morning of [[April 14]], the spearheads of the [[9th Panzer Division]] reached Kozani.

===Olympus and Servia passes===
[[Image:Battle of Greece - 15 April 1941.png|thumb|left|[[Front line]] on [[April 15]], [[1941]]]]

Wilson faced the prospect of being pinned by Germans operating from Thessaloniki, while being flanked by the German XL Panzer Corps descending through the Monastir Gap. On [[April 13]], he decided to withdraw all British forces to the Haliacmon river, and then to the narrow pass at [[Thermopylae]].<ref>Hondros (1983), 52</ref> On April 14 the 9th Panzer Division established a bridgehead across the Haliacmon river, but an attempt to advance beyond this point was stopped by intense enemy fire. This defense had three main components: the [[Platamon]] tunnel area between Olympus and the sea, the Olympus pass itself, and the [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] pass to the southeast. By channelling the attack through these three defiles, the new line offered far greater defensive strength for the limited forces available. The defenses of the Olympus and Servia passes consisted of the 4th New Zealand Brigade, 5th New Zealand Brigade, and the 16th Australian Brigade. For the next three days the advance of the 9th Panzer Division was stalled in front of these resolutely held positions.<ref>Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 94]<br />* Long (1953), [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/18/chapters/05.pdf 96]</ref> 

A ruined castle dominated the ridge across which the coastal pass led to Platamon. During the night of [[April 15]] a German motorcycle battalion supported by a tank battalion attacked the ridge, but the Germans were repulsed by the [[New Zealand 2nd Division|21st New Zealand Battalion]] under Colonel Macky, which suffered heavy losses in the process. Later that day a German armored regiment arrived and struck the coastal and inland flanks of the battalion, but the New Zealanders held their ground. After being reinforced during the night of the 15th-16th, the Germans managed to assemble a tank battalion, infantry battalion, and motor cycle battalion. The German infantry attacked the New Zealanders' left company at dawn, while the tanks attacked along the coast several hours later.<ref name="CB98">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 98]</ref> 
[[Image:AWM 007647 vevi.jpg|thumb|Australian anti-tank gunners resting, soon after their withdrawal from the Vevi area.]] 
The New Zealand battalion withdrew, crossed the [[Pineios River (Thessaly)|Pineios]] river, and by dusk reached the western exit of the Pineios Gorge, suffering only light casualties.<ref name="CB98" /> Macky was informed that it was "essential to deny the gorge to the enemy till [[April 19]] even if it meant extinction".<ref> Long (1953), [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/18/chapters/05.pdf 96]</ref> He sank the crossing barge at the western end of the gorge once all his men were across and began to set up defenses. The 21st battalion was reinforced  by the [[2/2nd Australian Infantry Battalion|Australian 2/2nd Battalion]] and later by the [[2/3rd Australian Infantry Battalion|2/3rd]], this force became known as ''Allen force'' after Brigadier [[Arthur Samuel Allen|"Tubby" Allen]]. The [[2/5th Australian Infantry Battalion|2/5th]] and [[2/11th Australian Infantry Battalion|2/11th battalions]] moved to the [[Elatia]] area south-west of the gorge and were ordered to hold the western exit possibly for three or four days.<ref> Long (1953), [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/18/chapters/05.pdf 96–97]</ref>
 
On [[April 16]] General Wilson met General Papagos at Lamia and informed him of his decision to withdraw to Thermopylae. General Blamey divided responsibility between generals Mackay and [[Bernard Freyberg, 1st Baron Freyberg|Freyberg]] during the leapfrogging move back to Thermopylae. Mackay would protect the flanks of the New Zealand Division as far south as an east-west line through Larissa and would control the withdrawal through [[Domokos]] to Thermopylae of the [[Stanley Savige|Savige]] and Zarkos Forces, and finally of Lee Force; the [[British 1st Armoured Brigade|1st Armored Brigade]] would cover the withdrawal of Savige Force to Larissa and thereafter the withdrawal of the 6th Division under whose command it would come; Freyberg would control the withdrawal of Allen Force which was to move along the same route as the New Zealand Division. The British Commonwealth forces remained under constant attack throughout the entire withdrawal.<ref> Long (1953), [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/18/chapters/05.pdf 98–99]</ref>

On the morning of [[April 18]] the struggle for the Pineios gorge was over, when German armored infantry crossed the river on floats and the 6th Mountain Division troops worked their way around the New Zealand battalion, which was subsequently annihilated. On [[April 19]] the first XVIII Mountain Corps troops entered Larissa and took possession of the airfield, where the British had left their supply dumps intact. The seizure of ten truckloads of rations and fuel enabled the spearhead units to continue their drive without ceasing. The port of [[Volos]], at which the British had re-embarked numerous units during the last few days, fell on [[April 21]]; there, the Germans captured large quantities of valuable diesel and crude oil.<ref name="CB100">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 100]</ref>

===Withdrawal and surrender of the Greek First Army===
[[Image:Tsolakoglou-jodl-ferrero-1941-04-23.jpeg|thumb|Tsolakoglou discusses in Thessaloniki ([[April 23]], [[1941]]) the third and final protocol of surrender of the Greek Army of Epirus with German General [[Alfred Jodl]] and Italian General Ferrero.]]
As the invading Germans advanced deep into Greek territory, the Greek First Army operating in Albania was reluctant to retreat. General Wilson described this unwillingness as "the fetishistic doctrine that not a yard of ground should be yielded to the Italians."<ref>Beevor (1994), 39</ref> It was not until [[April 13]] that the first Greek elements began to withdraw toward the Pindus mountains. The Allies' retreat to Thermopylae uncovered a route across the Pindus mountains by which the Germans might flank the Greek army in a rearguard action. An SS regiment was given the mission of cutting off the Greek First Army's line of retreat from Albania by driving westward to the [[Metsovon]] pass, and from there to Ioannina.<ref>Bailey (1979), 32</ref> On [[April 14]], heavy fighting took place at Kastoria pass, where the Germans blocked the Greek withdrawal. The withdrawal extended across the entire Albanian front, with the Italians in hesitant pursuit.<ref name="CB94">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 94]</ref> 

General Papagos rushed Greek units to the Metsovon pass where the Germans were expected to attack. On [[April 18]], a pitched battle between several Greek units and the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler brigade&mdash;which had by then reached [[Grevena]]&mdash; erupted.<ref name="CB94" /> The Greek units lacked the equipment necessary to fight against a motorised unit and were soon encircled and overwhelmed. The Germans advanced further and on [[April 19]] captured Ioannina, the final supply route of the Greek First Army.<ref>Long (1953), [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/18/chapters/05.pdf 95]</ref> Allied newspapers dubbed the Greek army's fate as a modern day [[Greek tragedy]]. Historian and former war-correspondent, Christopher Buckley, when describing the fate of the Greek army, states that "one experience[d] a genuine Aristotelian [[catharsis]], an awe-inspiring sense of the futility of all human effort and all human courage."<ref>Buckley (1984), 113</ref>

On [[April 20]], the commander of the Greek forces in Albania, General [[Georgios Tsolakoglou]],  realized the hopelessness of the situation and offered to surrender his army, which then consisted of fourteen divisions.<ref name="CB94" /> World War II historian [[John Keegan]] writes that Tsolakoglou "was so determined [...] to deny the Italians the satisfaction of a victory they had not earned that [...] he opened quite unauthorized parley with the commander of the German SS division opposite him, [[Sepp Dietrich]], to arrange a surrender to the Germans alone."<ref>Keegan (2005), 157</ref> On strict orders from Hitler negotiations were kept secret from the Italians, and the surrender was accepted.<ref name="CB94" /> Outraged by this decision Mussolini ordered counterattacks against the Greek forces, which were repulsed. It took personal representation from Mussolini to Hitler to bring together an armistice in which Italy was included on [[April 23]].<ref>Keegan (2005), 158</ref> Greek soldiers were not treated as [[prisoners of war]], and were allowed instead to go home after the demobilization of their units, while their officers were permitted to retain their side arms.<ref>Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 94–96]<br />* Hondros (1983), 90</ref>

===Thermopylae position===
{{details|Battle of Thermopylae (1941)}}
As early as [[April 16]], the German command realized that the British were evacuating troops on ships at Volos and Piraeus. The whole campaign had taken on the character of a pursuit. For the Germans it was now primarily a question of maintaining contact with the retreating British forces, and foiling their evacuation plans. German infantry divisions were withdrawn from action due to a lack of mobility. The 2d and 5th Panzer Divisions, the 1st SS Motorized Infantry Regiment, and both mountain divisions launched a pursuit on enemy forces.<ref name="CB103">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 103]</ref>  

To allow an evacuation of the main body of British forces, Wilson ordered the rear guard to make a last stand at the historic Thermopylae pass, the gateway to Athens. General Freyberg was given the task of defending the coastal pass, while Mackay was to hold the village of [[Brallos]]. After the battle Mackay was quoted as saying "I did not dream of evacuation; I thought that we'd hang on for about a fortnight and be beaten by weight of numbers."<ref name="L143">Long (1953),[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/18/chapters/06.pdf 143]</ref> When the order to retreat was received on the morning of [[April 23]] it was decided that each of the two positions was to be held by one brigade each. These brigades, the Australian 19th and 6th New Zealand were to hold the passes as long as possible, allowing the other units to withdraw. The Germans attacked on [[April 24]] at 11:30 a.m., met fierce resistance, lost fifteen tanks and sustained considerable casualties.<ref>Bailey (1979), 33<br />* {{cite encyclopedia|title=Brallos Pass|encyclopedia=The Encyclopaedia of Australia's Battles}}</ref> The Allies held out the entire day; with the delaying action accomplished, they retreated in the direction of the evacuation beaches and set up another rearguard at Thebes.<ref>Bailey (1979), 33</ref> The Panzer units launching a pursuit along the road leading across the pass made slow progress because of the steep gradient and a large number of difficult hairpin bends.<ref name="CB104">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 104]</ref>

After abandoning the Thermopylae area, the British rear guards withdrew to an improvised switch position south of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], where they erected a last obstacle in front of Athens. The motorcycle battalion of the 2nd Panzer Division, which had crossed to the island of [[Euboea]] to seize the port of [[Chalcis]], and had subsequently returned to the mainland, was given the mission of outflanking the British rear guard. The motorcycle troops encountered only slight resistance, and on the morning of  [[April 27]], [[1941]], the first Germans entered Athens, followed by [[Armored car (military)|armored cars]], [[tank]]s, and [[infantry]]. They captured intact large quantities of POL ([[petroleum]], [[oil]] and [[lubricants]]) several thousand tons of ammunition, ten trucks loaded with sugar and ten truckloads of other rations in addition to various other equipment, weapons, and medical supplies.<ref name="CB111">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 111]</ref>  The people of Athens had been expecting the Germans to enter the city for several days and kept themselves confined to their homes with their windows shut. The previous night Athens Radio had made the following announcement:
<blockquote>
You are listening to the voice of Greece. Greeks, stand firm, proud, and dignified. You must prove yourselves worthy of your history. The valor and victory of our army has already been recognized. The righteousness of our cause will also be recognized. We did our duty honestly. Friends! Have Greece in your hearts, live inspired with the fire of her latest triumph and the glory of our army. Greece will live again and will be great, because she fought honestly for a just cause and for freedom. Brothers! Have courage and patience. Be stouthearted. We will overcome these hardships. Greeks! With Greece in your minds you must be proud and dignified. We have been an honest nation and brave soldiers.<ref>Fafalios-Hadjipateras (1995), 248–249</ref>

The Germans drove straight to the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] and raised the [[Flag of Nazi Germany|Nazi flag]]. According to the most popular account of the events, the [[Evzones|Evzone]] soldier on guard duty, [[Konstantinos Koukidis]], took down the [[Greek flag]], refusing to hand it to the invaders wrapped himself in it, and jumped off the Acropolis.<ref>[http://www.hri.org/news/greek/eraen/2000/00-10-12.eraen.html Events Marking the Anniversary of the Liberation of the City of Athens], The Hellenic Radio</ref> Whether the story was true or not, many Greeks believed it and viewed the soldier as a [[martyr]].<ref>Bailey (1979), 33</ref>

General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the commander of British Army forces in the Middle East, when in Greece on April 11–13, had warned Wilson that he must expect no reinforcements, and had authorised Major General [[Freddie de Guingand]] to discuss evacuation plans with certain responsible officers. Nevertheless, the British could not at this stage adopt or even mention this course of action; the suggestion had to come from the Greek Government. The following day Papagos made the first move when he suggested to Wilson that W Force should be withdrawn. Wilson informed Middle East Headquarters and on 17 April [[Rear admiral]] H. T. Baillie-Grohman was sent to Greece to prepare for the evacuation.<ref name="M362">McClymont (1959), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c16-1.html 362]</ref> That day Wilson hastened to Athens where he attended a conference with the King, Papagos, d'Albiac and Rear admiral Turle.

On April 25, the Germans staged an airborne operation to seize the bridges over the [[Corinth Canal|Corinth canal]], with the double aim of both cutting off the British line of retreat and securing their own way across the [[Isthmus of Corinth|isthmus]]. The attack met with initial success, until a stray British shell destroyed the bridge.<ref name="CB108">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 108]</ref> The 1st SS Motorized Infantry Regiment, assembled at Ioannina, thrust along the western foothills of the Pindus Mountains via [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] to [[Messolonghi]], and crossed over to the Peloponnese at [[Patras]] in an effort to gain access to the isthmus from the west. Upon their arrival at 5:30 p.m. on [[April 27]] the SS forces learned that the paratroops had already been relieved by Army units advancing from Athens.<ref name="CB111" />

The erection of a temporary span across the Corinth canal permitted 5th Panzer Division units to pursue the enemy forces across the Peloponnese.

===Triple occupation===
{{details|Axis occupation of Greece during World War II}}

On [[April 13]], [[1941]], Hitler issued his Directive No. 27, which illustrated his future occupying policy in Greece.<ref name="R602">Richter (1998), 602</ref> He finalized jurisdiction in the Balkans with his Directive No. 31 issued on [[June 9]].<ref name="R615">Richter (1998), 615</ref> Mainland Greece was divided between Germany, Italy, and Bulgaria. German forces occupied the strategically more important areas, namely [[Athens]], [[Thessaloniki]] with [[Central Macedonia]], and several Aegean islands, including most of Crete. They also occupied Florina, which was claimed by both Italy and Bulgaria.<ref name="R616">Richter (1998), 616</ref> On the same day that Tsolakoglou offered his surrender, the Bulgarian Army invaded [[Thrace]]. The goal was to gain an Aegean Sea outlet in Western Thrace and Eastern Macedonia. The Bulgarians occupied territory between the [[Struma River|Strimon river]] and a line of demarcation running through [[Alexandroupoli]] and [[Svilengrad]] west of [[Maritsa|Evros]] river.<ref name="R616-617">Richter (1998), 616–617</ref> The remainder of Greece was left to Italy. Italian troops started occupying the Ionian and Aegean islands on [[April 28]]. On [[June 2]] they occupied the Peloponnese, on [[June 8]] [[Thessaly]], and on [[June 12]] most of [[Attica]].<ref name="R615">Richter (1998), 615</ref>

The occupation of Greece, during which civilians suffered terrible hardships, and died from privation and hunger, proved to be a difficult and costly task. It led to the creation of several [[Greek Resistance|resistance groups]], which launched guerilla attacks against the occupying forces and set up espionage networks.<ref>Carlton (1992), 136</ref>

{{details|Battle of Crete}}
On [[April 25]], [[1941]], King George II and his government left the Greek mainland for Crete, which was attacked by Nazi forces on [[May 20]], [[1941]].<ref name="HKG">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Crete, Battle of|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia "The Helios"}}<br />* {{cite encyclopedia|title=George II|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia "The Helios"}}</ref> The Germans employed parachute forces in a massive airborne invasion, and launched their offensive against three main airfields of the island in [[Maleme]], [[Rethymno]], and [[Heraklion]]. After seven days of fighting and tough resistance, Allied commanders decided that the cause was hopeless, and ordered a withdrawal from [[Sfakia]]. By [[June 1]], [[1941]], the evacuation of Crete by the Allies was complete and the island was under German occupation. In light of the heavy casualties suffered by the élite [[German 7th Flieger Division|7th Flieger Division]], Hitler forbade further airborne operations.<ref name="B231">Beevor (1992), 231</ref> General Kurt Student would dub Crete "the graveyard of the German paratroopers" and a "disastrous victory."<ref name="B231" /> During the night of [[May 24]], George II and his government were evacuated from Crete to Egypt.<ref name="HG" />

==Assessments==
{{Battle of Greece timeline infobox}}
The Greek campaign ended in a complete German victory. The British did not have the necessary military resources in the [[Middle East]] to permit them to carry out simultaneous Iarge-scale operations in North Africa and the Balkans. Moreover, even if they had been able to block the German advance into Greece, they would have been unable to exploit the situation by a counterthrust across the Balkans. In enumerating the reasons for the complete German victory in Greece, the following factors seem to have been of the greatest significance:
#Germany's superiority in ground forces and equipment;<ref name="McC">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 116–118]<br />* McClymont (1959), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c23-1.html 471–472]</ref>
#German supremacy in the air combined with the inability of the Greeks to provide to the RAF more airfields;<ref name="CB116-118">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 116–118]</ref>
#Inadequacy of the British expeditionary force, since the Imperial force available was small;<ref name="McC" />
#Poor condition of the Greek Army and its shortage of modern equipment;<ref name="CB116-118" />
#Inadequate port, road and railway facilities;<ref name="Mc471-472">McClymont (1959), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c23-1.html 471–472]</ref>
#Absence of a unified command and lack of cooperation between the British, Greek, and Yugoslav forces;<ref name="CB116-118" />
#Turkey's strict neutrality;<ref name="CB116-118" /> and
#The early collapse of Yugoslav resistance.<ref name="CB116-118" /> 

After the defeat of the Allies, the decision to send British forces into Greece was met with fierce criticism in the UK. Field Marshal [[Alan Brooke]], [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] during World War II, considered intervention in Greece to be "a definite strategic blunder", as it denied Wavell the necessary reserves to complete the conquest of [[History of Libya as Italian Colony|Italian-held Libya]], or to successfully withstand [[Erwin Rommel]]'s [[Afrika Korps]] March offensive. It thus prolonged the [[North African Campaign]], which otherwise might have been successfully concluded within 1941.<ref name="B113">Broad (1958), 113</ref> In 1947 de Guingand asked the British government to recognize the mistakes it made when it laid out its strategy in Greece.<ref name="R624">Richter (1998), 624</ref> Buckley, on the other hand, argued that, if the UK had not answered its commitment of 1939 to defend Greece's independence, it would have severely damaged the ethical rationalizations of its struggle against Nazi Germany.<ref name="B138">Buckley (1984), 138</ref> According to Professor of History, Heinz Richter, Churchill tried through the campaign in Greece to influence the political atmosphere in the United States, and he insisted on this strategy even after the defeat.<ref name="R424">Richter (1998), 633</ref> According to [[John Keegan]], "the Greek campaign had been an old-fashioned gentlemen's war, with honor given and accepted by brave adversaries on each side", and the Greek and Allied forces, being vastly outnumbered, "had, rightly, the sensation of having fought the good fight."<ref name="K158">Keegan (2005), 158</ref>  

Freyberg and Blamey had also serious doubts about the feasibility of the operation, but failed to advise their governments of their reservations and apprehensions.<ref name="Mc475-476">McClymont (1959), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c23-2.html 475–476]</ref> The campaign caused a furor in Australia, when it became known that, when he received his first warning of the move to Greece on [[February 18]], [[1941]], General Blamey was worried but had not informed the [[Australian Government]], having been told by General Wavell that [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Menzies|Menzies]] had already given his approval of the plan.<ref name="Mc476">McClymont (1959), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c23-2.html 476]</ref> Indeed, the proposal had been accepted by a meeting of the War Cabinet in London at which Mr Menzies was present, but the Australian Prime Minister had been told by Churchill that both Freyberg and Blamey approved of the expedition.<ref name="R338">Richter (1998), 338</ref> On [[March 5]], in a letter to Menzies, Blamey said that "the plan is, of course, what I feared: piecemeal dispatch to Europe", and the next day he called the operation "most hazardous". However, thinking that he was agreeable, the Australian Government had already committed the Australian Imperial Force to the Greek Campaign.<ref name="Mc115-476">McClymont (1959), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c6-13.html 115] and [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c23-2.html 476]</ref>

In 1942 members of the [[British Parliament]] characterized the campaign in Greece as a "political and sentimental decision". Eden rejected the critics, argued that the UK's decision was unanimous, and asserted that the Battle of Greece delayed the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union.<ref name="R638-639">Richter (1998), 638–639</ref> This is an argument that some historians, such as Keegan have also used, in order to prove that Greek resistance may have been a turning point in World War II.<ref name="K144">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Greece (World War II)|encyclopedia=An Encyclopedia of Battles}}<br />* Keegan (2005), 144</ref> According to [[Leni Riefenstahl]], Hitler said that "if the Italians hadn't attacked Greece and needed our help, the war would have taken a different course. We could have anticipated the Russian cold by weeks and conquered Leningrad and Moscow. There would have been no [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]]".<ref>Riefenstahl (1987), 295</ref> Despite his reservations, Brooke seems also to have conceded that the start of the offensive against the Soviet Union was in fact delayed because of the Balkan Campaign.<ref name="B113" /> John N. Bradley and Thomas B. Buell conclude that "although no single segment of the Balkan campaign forced the Germans to delay Barbarossa, obviously the entire campaign did prompt them to wait."<ref name="BB101">Bradley-Buell (2002), 101</ref> On the other hand, Richter calls Eden's arguments a "falsification of history".<ref name="R639-640">Richter (1998), 639–640</ref> [[Basil Liddell Hart]] and de Guingand asserted that, even if Operation Marita delayed the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, this is not enough to vindicate the decision of the British government, because this was not its initial strategic goal.<ref name="R640">Richter (1998), 640</ref> In 1952 a scientific research of the Historical Branch of the UK Cabinet Office concluded that the Balkan Campaign had no influence on the launching of Operation Barbarossa.<ref name="R640">Richter (1998), 640</ref> According to Robert Kirchubel, "the main causes for deferring Barbarossa's start from [[May 15]] to [[June 22]] were incomplete logistical arrangements, and an unusually wet winter that kept rivers at full flood until late spring."<ref name="K16">Kirchubel (2005), 16</ref>

In a speech made at the Reichstag in 1941, Hitler expressed his admiration for the Greek resistance,{{Cref|h}} saying of the campaign: "Historical justice obliges me to state that of the enemies who took up positions against us, the Greek soldier particularly fought with the highest courage. He capitulated only when further resistance had become impossible and useless." The Führer also ordered the release, and repatriation of all Greek prisoners of war, as soon as they had been disarmed, "because of their gallant bearing."<ref>Hitler, [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/4_May%2C_1941 Speech to the Reichstag on May 4, 1941]<br />* Keitel (1965), 165–166</ref> According to Hitler's Chief of Staff, Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel]], the Führer "wanted to give the Greeks an honorable settlement in recognition of their brave struggle, and of their blamelessness for this war: after all the Italians had started it."{{Cref|i}} Inspired by the Greek resistance during the Italian and German invasions, Churchill said, "Hence we will not say that Greeks fight like heroes, but that heroes fight like Greeks".<ref>[http://greekembassy.org/Embassy/Content/en/Article.aspx?office=1&folder=361&article=19051 Celebration of Greek Armed Forces in Washington], Press Office of the Embassy of Greece<br />* {{cite encyclopedia|title=Greece, History of|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia "The Helios"}}</ref> In response to a letter from George II dated [[December 3]], [[1940]], American President [[Franklin D.

==Notes==
<div class="references-small">
{{Cnote|a|Sources do not agree on the number of the soldiers the British Commonwealth managed to evacuate. According to British sources, 50,732 soldiers were evacuated.<ref name="MMT">Murray-Millett (2000), 105<br />* Titterton (2002), 84</ref> But of these, according to G.A.

Gavin Long (part of Australia's official history of World War II) gives a figure around 46,500, while, according to W.G. McClymont (part of New Zealand's official history of World War II), 50,172 soldiers were evacuated.<ref>Long (1953), [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/18/chapters/07.pdf 182–183]<br />* McClymont (1959), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-b1.html 486]</ref> McClymont points out that "the differences are understandable if it is remembered that the embarkations took place at night and in great haste and that among those evacuated there were Greeks and refugees."<ref name="Mc486">McClymont (1959), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-b1.html 486]</ref>}}
{{Cnote|b|On two preceding occasions Hitler had agreed that the Mediterranean and [[Adriatic]] were exclusively Italian [[spheres of interest]].

{{Cnote|c|According to the [[U.S. Army Center of Military History]], "the almost immediate setbacks of the Italians only served to heighten Hitler's displeasure.

{{Cnote|e|According to the U.S. Army Center of Military History, the Greeks informed the Yugoslavs of this decision, and they in turn made it known to the German Government.<ref name="C72">Blau (1953), [http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 72]</ref> Papagos writes on this subject:
<blockquote>This, incidentally, disposes of the German assertion that they were forced to attack us only in order to expel the British from Greece, for they knew that, if they had not marched into Bulgaria, no British troops would have landed in Greece. Their assertion was merely an excuse on their part to enable them to plead extenuating circumstances in justification of their aggression against a small nation, already entangled in a war against a Great Power. But, irrespective of the presence or absence of British troops in the Balkans, German intervention would have taken place firstly because the Germans had to secure the right flank of the German Army which was to operate against Russia according to the plans already prepared in autumn 1940, and secondly because the possession of the southern part of the [[Balkan Peninsula]] commanding the eastern end of the Mediterranean was of great strategic importance for Germany's plan of attacking Great Britain and the line of Imperial communications with the East.<ref name="P317">Papagos (1949), 317</ref></blockquote>}}
{{Cnote|f|During the night of [[April 6]], [[1941]], and while the German invasion had already began, the Yugoslavs informed the Greeks that they would implement the plan: they would attack the Italian troops in the morning of the next day at 6:00 a.m. At 3:00 a.m. of [[April 7]] the thirteenth division of the Greek First Army attacked the Italian troops, occupied two heights, and captured 565 Italians (15 officers and 50 soldiers).
