'''Kubrat''' or '''Kurt''' ({{lang-bg|Кубрат}}; {{lang-el|Χουβρατις}}) was a Bulgar ruler credited with creating the confederation of [[Old Great Bulgaria]] in [[632]] by defeating the [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] and uniting under a single rule all the [[Bulgars|Bulgar tribes]].

== Historical data ==
The name Kubrat is first mentioned by [[Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople]], in his ''Historia syntomos, breviarium'' in the [[9th century]].
In the [[Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans]] Kubrat is mentioned as Kurt of the [[Dulo clan]]. A later legend would describe him as a descendant of [[Attila the Hun]]. Some historians conclude that his maternal line was of the [[Ermy]] clan, because his maternal uncle [[Organa]] was possibly of that clan.<ref> [[Vasil Zlatarski]], ''History of Bulgaria'' </ref>

Kubrat spent time at the [[Byzantine]] court, either as a hostage or for protection from the dynastic war within the [[Gok Turks|Turkic Khaganate]]. As the [[7th century]] Byzantine historian [[John of Nikiu]] narrates:

:''Quetrades (i.e. Kubrat), the prince of the Moutanes (i.e.[[Huns]]), and a nephew of Kuemaka (i.e.Organa), was baptized as a child and was educated in [[Constantinople]] and received into the Christian community in his childhood and had grown up in the imperial palace.' He was a close friend of emperor [[Heraclius]].'' <ref>[[John of Nikiû]], [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/nikiu2_chronicle.htm ''Chronicle'']</ref>

Whether he was a child or an adult during his time in Constantinople is unclear, as the year of his birth is unknown. The exact time of this event is also unknown but probably coincided with the reign of Emperor [[Heraclius]] ([[610]]-[[641]]). If the above text really applies to Kubrat then it becomes clear that during his stay in [[Constantinople]] he was educated and [[baptism|baptized]]. Probably at the same time he was given the title [[Patrician#Patrician position|Patrician]] which was inscribed on his ring.

[[Image:DeBoor.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Quote from the Patriarch Nikephoros' ''Short History''<ref>[http://www.amazon.ca/dp/0405071930 Nicephori Archiepiscopi Constantinopolitani Opuscula Historica], editor [[Carl G. de Boor]], 24, 9-12.</ref> mentioning Kubrat as ruler of the Unogundurs and the expelling of the Avars]]

Upon return Kubrat took power over his tribe, the [[Utigurs|Utigur Bulgars]], from Organa who had acted as [[regent]] until then. At some point, as Patriarch Nikephoros tells us, Kubrat expelled the Avar troops from his lands and ruled singlehandedly over the united Bulgars thus creating the Great Bulgaria, as it was known to its contemporaries. Under his rule the Old Great Bulgaria grew to stretch from the [[Danube]] delta to the [[Volga]] river, and was recognized by an international treaty signed with [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]] in [[635]]. Kubrat ruled in peace with the [[Byzantine Empire]], a result of his close friendship with the Byzantine emperor and, conceivably, of his appreciation of Byzantine culture.

== Gravesite == <!--it was not a kurgan, please stop adding this term.-->
{{main|Pereshchepina hoard}}

In [[1912]] Ukrainian peasants in the vicinity of [[Poltava]] literally stumbled over a gravesite replete with magnificent gold and silver objects of total weight of 75 kg, including a ring which eventually allowed identification of the grave as that belonging to Khan Kubrat.
The ring was inscribed "Chouvr(a)Tou patr(i)k(iou)", indicating the status he had achieved in the Byzantine world.

== Modern uses ==
[[Kubrat Knoll]] on [[Livingston Island]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Antarctica]] is named after Kubrat of Great Bulgaria.
