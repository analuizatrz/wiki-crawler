{{Politics of the Philippines}}
A '''city''' ('''''lungsod''''', or sometimes '''''siyudad''''', in [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]) is a tier of local government in the [[Philippines]]. All Philippine cities are '''chartered cities''', whose existence as corporate and administrative entities is governed by their own specific [[municipal charter|charters]] in addition to the Local Government Code of 1991, which specifies the administrative structure and political powers of subnational government entities. Cities are given the power to have one [[Legislative districts of the Philippines|congressional district]] and representative per every 250,000 population count, a police force, a common seal, and the power to take, purchase, receive, hold, lease, convey, and disposes of real and personal property for the general interests of the City, condemn private property for public use (eminent domain), contract and be contracted with, sue and exercise all the powers conferred to it by [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]]. Only an [[Republic Act|Act of Congress]] can create or amend a city charter, and with this city charter Congress confers to a city certain powers that regular [[Municipalities of the Philippines|municipalities]] or even other cities may not have. Despite the differences in the powers accorded to each city, all cities regardless of status are given special treatment in terms of being given a bigger share of the internal revenue allotment (IRA) compared to regular municipalities.

A city's local government is composed of a Mayor as its Chief Executive, a Vice-Mayor which heads the city council, and a city council (''[[Sangguniang Panlungsod]]'') that serves as the city's legislative body. Cities, like municipalities, are composed of [[barangay]]s which may be grouped into officially-defined administrative districts. Examples of such are the cities of [[Davao City|Davao]] ([[Districts of Davao City|11 districts]]), [[Iloilo City|Iloilo]] ([[Iloilo City#Subdivisions|6 districts]]), and [[Samal City|Samal]] (3 districts: Babak, Kaputian and Samal). Some cities such as [[Caloocan]] and [[Manila]] even have an intermediate level between the district and barangay levels, called a zone. However, city districts and zones mostly serve to make city planning and other administrative tasks easier and more convenient; there are no elected city government officials in these city-specific administrative levels. 

There are two [[metropolitan areas]] in the Philippines. [[Metro Manila]] is the largest [[conurbation]] or urban [[agglomeration]] in the country. It is composed of the city of [[Manila]] plus 15 neighboring cities and a municipality. The second is [[Metro Cebu]] in [[Cebu Province]]. It is centered on [[Cebu City]], the provincial capital plus 12 surrounding cities and municipalities. 

==Classification==
=== City classification ===
The Local Government Code of 1991 (Republic Act 7160) classifies all cities into one of three categories:

'''Highly Urbanized Cities''' - Cities with a minimum population of two hundred thousand (200,000) inhabitants, as certified by the National Statistics Office, and with the latest annual income of at least Fifty Million Pesos (P50,000,000.00) based on 1991 constant prices, as certified by the city treasurer. There are currently 32 highly urbanized cities in the Philippines, half of them located in Metro Manila.

'''Independent Component Cities''' -  Cities whose charters prohibit their voters from voting for provincial elective officials. Independent component cities are independent of the province. There are five such cities: [[Dagupan]], [[Cotabato City|Cotabato]], [[Naga City, Camarines Sur|Naga (in Bicol)]], [[Ormoc]] and [[Santiago City|Santiago]].

'''Component Cities''' - Cities which do not meet the above requirements are considered component cities of the province in which they are geographically located. If a component city is located within the boundaries of two (2) or more provinces, such city shall be considered a component of the province of which it used to be a municipality.

Definitions taken from [http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/articles/con_cityclass.asp National Statistical Coordination Board].

===Income classification===

Cities are classified according to average annual income based on the previous 3 calendar years. [http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/articles/con_income.asp]

*1st class - P300 million or more
*2nd class - P240 million or more but less than P 300 million
*3rd class - P180 million or more but less than P240 million
*4th class - P120 million or more but less than P180 million
*5th class - P60 million or more but less than P120 million
*6th class - Below P 60 million

==Independent cities==
There are 37 independent cities in the Philippines, all of which are classified as either "highly-urbanized" or "independent component" cities.  From a legal and fiscal standpoint, once a city is classified as such:
* its [[Sangguniang Panlungsod]] legislation becomes no longer subject to review by any province's [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan]]
* it stops sharing its tax revenue with any province
Consequently, the governor and the provincial government does not exercise power over any independent city, as stated in Section 29 of the Local Government Code<ref name="LGC">[http://119.111.101.4/statutes/repacts/ra1991/ra_7160_1991.html Local Government Code of 1991 (Republic Act 7160)]</ref>, although they and the government of the independent city can always cooperatively work together.

While all independent cities enjoy legal and fiscal autonomy from [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]], some have specific charter provisions that enable the city's residents to vote for and/or run for elective positions (governor, vice-governor, provincial board members) in the provincial government.
* Independent cities whose charters expressly allow residents to both vote and run for provincial offices: [[Lucena City|Lucena]], [[Mandaue]]
* Independent cities whose charters only expressly allow residents to vote for provincial officials: [[Lapu-Lapu City|Lapu-Lapu]], [[Puerto Princesa]]
* Independent cities whose charters only expressly allow residents to only run for provincial offices: Dagupan, Naga (in Bicol)
Registered voters of the cities of Bacolod, [[Baguio]], [[Butuan]], Cebu, Cotabato, Iloilo, Davao, [[General Santos City|General Santos]], [[Olongapo]], Ormoc, Santiago, [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]], and all cities within Metro Manila are not qualified to vote for provincial officials. In addition, those who are solely residents of these cities can not run for, and be elected, to any position in the governments of the provinces to which their cities formerly belonged. 

Prior to 1980, the eligibility of cities to vote for provincial officials was determined by their respective charters. With the enactment of [[Batas Pambansa]] Bilang 51 on December 22, 1979, all cities that were classified as belonging to the newly-introduced "highly urbanized city" distinction lost their eligibility to participate in provincial elections regardless of what their charters indicated. As a result, the cities of [[Bacolod City|Bacolod]], Butuan, Cebu, Iloilo and Olongapo became ineligible to vote for provincial officials. Exceptions to this rule are the cities which were incorporated before 1980 but declared as highly urbanized after 1987 (Lapu-Lapu, Lucena, Mandaue and Puerto Princesa), as Section 452 (c) of the Local Government Code guarantees this.<ref name="LGC" />

In addition to the eligibility of some independent cities to vote in provincial elections, a few other factors become sources of confusion regarding their autonomy from provinces. Some independent cities still serve as the seat of government of the respective provinces in which they are geographically located: Bacolod ([[Negros Occidental]]), Butuan ([[Agusan del Norte]]), [[Cagayan de Oro]] ([[Misamis Oriental]]), Cebu City (Cebu), Iloilo City ([[Iloilo]]), Lucena ([[Quezon]]), [[Pasig City|Pasig]] ([[Rizal (province)|Rizal]]) and [[Puerto Princesa]] ([[Palawan]]). In such cases, the provincial government takes care of the expenses of maintaining its properties such as provincial government buildings and offices outside its jurisdiction by paying for the actual cost of running these facilities as well as providing the host city government with an annual amount (which the province determines at its discretion) to aid in relieving incidental costs incurred to the city. 

The representation of a city in the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] (or lack thereof) is not a criterion for its independence from a province, as Congress is for national legislation and is part of national (central) government. Despite [[Antipolo City|Antipolo]] and [[San Jose del Monte City|San Jose del Monte]] having their own representatives in Congress, they are still component cities of [[Rizal province|Rizal]] and [[Bulacan]] respectively, as their respective charters specifically converted them into component cities and do not contain any provision that severs their relations with their respective provincial governments.

And while 21 independent cities have their own representative(s) in Congress - 22 when [[Navotas]] gets its own seat in 2010 - some still remain as part of the partial representation of the province to which they previously belonged. In this case, independent cities that do not vote for provincial officials are excluded in Sangguniang Panlalawigan districts, and the allotment of SP members is adjusted accordingly by [[COMELEC]] with proper consideration of population. For example, [[Agusan del Norte]], being a third-class province in terms of income, is entitled to have eight members in its Sangguniang Panlalawigan and [[Legislative districts of Agusan del Norte|2 congressional districts]]. The seats of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan are not evenly distributed (4-4) between the province's first and second congressional districts because its first ''congressional'' district contains [[Butuan]], an independent city which does not vote for provincial officials. The seats are distributed 1-7 to account for the small population of the province's ''1st Sangguniang Panlalawigan district'' (comprised only of [[Las Nieves, Agusan del Norte|Las Nieves]]) and the bulk of the province's population being in the second district. Conversely, the cities of [[Lapu-Lapu City|Lapu-Lapu]] and [[Mandaue]], which are eligible to vote for provincial officials, still form part of the province of Cebu's ''6th Sangguniang Panlalawigan district'', which is coterminous with the [[Legislative districts of Cebu#6th District|6th congressional district of Cebu]]. 

Being part of an administrative region different from the province's own does not make a city independent. The city of [[Isabela City|Isabela]] functions as a component city of [[Basilan]]: its tax revenues are shared with the provincial government, its residents are eligible to vote and run for provincial offices, and it is served by the provincial government and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan with regard to provincially-devolved services. However, by opting to remain within [[Zamboanga Peninsula|Region IX]], Isabela City's residents are not eligible to elect and be elected to ''regional'' offices of the expanded [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM) which now includes the rest of Basilan. Services that are administered regionally are provided to Isabela City through the offices of Region IX based in Zamboanga City; the rest of Basilan is served by the ARMM and the regional government based in Cotabato City. Isabela City is not independent from its province, rather it is simply outside the jurisdiction of the ARMM, the region to which the other component units of Basilan belongs.

Many government agencies, as well as Philippine society in general, still continue to classify many independent cities outside Metro Manila as part of provinces due to historical and cultural ties, especially if these cities were, and are still, important economic, cultural and social activity centers within the geographic bounds of the provinces to which they previously belonged. Furthermore, most maps of the Philippines showing provincial boundaries almost always never separate independent cities from the provinces in which they are geographically located for [[cartography|cartographic]] convenience. Despite being first-level administrative divisions (on the same level as provinces), independent cities are still treated by many to be on the same level as municipalities and component cities (second-level administrative divisions) for educational convenience and reduced complexity.

==Creation of cities==
Congress is the lone legislative entity that can incorporate cities. However, [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan|provincial]] and [[Sangguniang Bayan|municipal councils]] can pass resolutions indicating a desire to have a certain area (usually an already-existing municipality or a cluster of barangays) declared a city after the requirements for becoming a city are met. As per [http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno9009.html Republic Act 9009], these requirements include: 
* locally generated income of at least [[Philippine peso|PHP]] 100 million (based on constant prices in the year 2000) for the last two consecutive years, as certified by the Department of Finance, '''AND'''
* a population of 150,000 or more, as certified by the [[National Statistics Office]] (NSO); '''OR''' a contiguous territory of 100 square kilometers, as certified by the [[Bureau of Lands Management (Philippines)|Land Management Bureau]], with contiguity not being a requisite for areas that are on two or more [[island]]s.
Members of Congress (usually the representatives of the district to which the proposed city belongs) then draft the legislation that will convert or create the city. After the bill passes through both the House of Representatives and the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] and becomes an Act of Congress, the [[President of the Philippines|President]] signs the Act into law. If the Act goes unsigned after 30 days it still becomes law despite the absence of the President's signature. 

Most post-1946 cities were created in the manner described above. Before 1987 many cities were created without any plebiscite conducted for the residents to ratify the charter, most notable of which were cities created during the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth Era (1935-1946)]] such as [[Tagaytay]], Dansalan (now [[Marawi]]), Zamboanga and Iloilo. But since 1987 it has been constitutionally mandated that any change to the legal status of any local government unit require the ratification by the residents that would be affected by such changes, thus all cities created after 1986 acquired their corporate status only after the majority of its voting residents approved the charter.

==Motivations for cityhood==
Although some earlier cities were given charters because of their advantageous or strategic locations ([[Angeles City|Angeles]], Baguio, Cotabato, Olongapo, Tagaytay, Zamboanga) or incorporated to especially establish new government centers in otherwise sparsely populated areas ([[Palayan City|Palayan]], [[Trece Martires City|Trece Martires]], Quezon City), most Philippine cities were originally incorporated to provide a form of localized civil government to an area that is primarily urban, which, due to its compact nature and different demography and local economy, cannot be necessarily handled more efficiently by more rural-oriented provincial and municipal governments. However, not all cities are purely areas of dense urban settlement. To date there are still cities with huge expanses of rural or wilderness areas and considerable non-urban populations, such as Puerto Princesa, Zamboanga and Davao, as they were deliberately incorporated with increased future resource needs and urban expansion, as well as strategic considerations in mind.

With the enactment of the 1991 Local Government Code, municipalities and cities have both become more empowered to deal with local issues. Regular municipalities now share many of the same powers of chartered cities, but its citizens and/or leaders may feel that it might be to their best interest to get a larger share of internal revenue allotment (IRA) and acquire more powers by becoming a city, especially if the population and local economy has grown enough. On the other hand, due to the higher property taxes that would be imposed after cityhood, many citizens have become wary of their town's conversion into a city, even if the municipality had already achieved a high degree of urbanization and has an annual income that already exceeds that of many lower-income cities. This has been among the cases made against the cityhood bids of many high-income and populous municipalities surrounding Metro Manila, most notably [[Bacoor]] and [[Dasmariñas]], which for many years have been more qualified to become cities than others.

In response to the rapid increase in the number of municipalities being converted into cities, Senator [[Aquilino Pimentel]] authored what became Republic Act 9009 in June 2001 which sought to establish a more appropriate benchmark by which municipalities that wished to become cities were to be measured.<ref name="LCP">[http://www.lcp-policy.blogspot.com/ LCP Policy Blog]</ref> The income requirement was increased sharply from PHP 20 million to PHP 100 million in a bid to curb the spate of conversions into cities of municipalities that were perceived to have not become urbanized or economically developed enough to be able to properly function as a city.

Despite the passage of RA 9009, recently there have been many municipalities not meeting the required locally-generated income that had been converted into cities by seeking exemption from the income requirement. This has led to vocal opposition from the [[League of Cities of the Philippines]] against the cityhood of 12 such municipalities, with the League arguing that by letting these municipalities become cities, Congress will set "a dangerous precedent" that would not prevent others from seeking the same "special treatment." <ref name="LCP" /> More importantly, the LCP has indicated that with the recent surge in the conversion of towns that did not meet the requirements set by RA 9009 for becoming cities, the allocation received by existing cities would only drastically decrease because more cities will have to share the amount allotted by the national government, which is equal to 23% of the IRA, which in turn is 40% of all the revenues collected by the [[Bureau of Internal Revenue (Philippines)|Bureau of Internal Revenue]].<ref name="trenas">[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/feb/09/yehey/prov/20070209pro1.html League of Cities wants veto on cityhood of 12 towns]</ref>

==Changing city status==
Most cities in the Philippines have essentially remained in their status since their charters were first given to them. However, a city's classification can be upgraded or downgraded depending on the wishes of the residents and/or leaders of the city.

===Upgrading===
* Component city to independent component city: All that is needed is a congressional amendment to the city charter prohibiting city residents to vote for provincial officials. So far no city has been upgraded this way.
* Component/independent component city to highly-urbanized city: 
** Once a city has a population of 200,000 persons as certified by the NSO and an income of PHP 50 million (based on 1991 constant prices) as certified by the city treasurer, the city government can submit a request to the [[President of the Philippines|President]] to have their city declared as highly urbanized within 30 days. Upon the President's declaration, a plebiscite will be held within a specific timeframe to ratify this conversion. Lapu-Lapu, Lucena, Mandaue and Puerto Princesa became HUCs in this manner. However, the cities of [[Tarlac City|Tarlac]] and [[Cabanatuan]] failed to become HUCs after majority of their voters voted against the conversion.
** When Batas Pambansa Blg. 51 was enacted in 1979, all cities whose incomes at the time were PHP 40 million or higher became highly urbanized cities, whose political relations with their respective provinces were severed. Chartered cities that lost their eligibility to vote for provincial officials now became independent of any province. Angeles, Bacolod, Butuan, Cebu, Iloilo and Olongapo became HUCs by 1980, and have been independent cities since then.

===Downgrading===
* Highly urbanized city to component city: Reclassifying an HUC as a component city likely involves not only amending the concerned city's charter, but also the Local Government Code<ref name="Cuenco">[http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/ceb/2005/05/27/news/cuenco.ready.to.work.for.it.del.mar.wants.to.be.sure.html Cuenco ready to work for it; del Mar wants to be sure]</ref>, as currently there is no provision in the LGC that allows this, nor are there any precedents. Some Cebu City politicians have indicated that they wish to bring back the city under the province's control, in order to bring in more votes against the proposed division of the province of Cebu.<ref name="Cuenco" />
* Independent component city to component city: All that is needed is a congressional amendment to the city charter enabling city residents to vote for provincial officials, followed by a plebiscite. [[Santiago City]]'s status as an independent component city was briefly altered after the enactment of [http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno8528.html Republic Act 8528] on February 14, 1998 which made it a regular component city. The Supreme Court on September 16, 1999 however ruled in favor of the city's mayor who contended that such a change in the status of the city required a plebiscite just like any other merger, division, abolition or alteration in boundaries of any political unit. And due to the lack of a plebiscite to affirm such a change, RA 8528 was therefore unconstitutional.<ref name="santiago">[http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/1999/sept99/133064.htm Supreme Court - Jurisprudence - Miranda vs Aguirre]</ref> 
* Non-voting component city to voting component city: From 1980 to 1991, cities that were not considered as highly urbanized were considered component cities of their provinces, regardless of whether their city charters allowed them to vote for provincial officials or not. The cities of [[Oroquieta City|Oroquieta]] ([[Misamis Occidental]]) and [[San Carlos City, Pangasinan|San Carlos]] ([[Pangasinan]]) are special cases, in that because the Local Government Code was not yet in force at the time when Republic Acts [http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno6726.html 6726] and [http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno6843.html 6843] respectively enabled both cities to once again become eligible to vote for officials of their respective provinces, their conversion into voting component cities were not considered technically as a downgrading <ref name="santiago" />, but rather a simple change that did not require a plebiscite, since under BP 51 they were not considered highly urbanized cities, but component cities, as the independent component city classification was only introduced through the LGC in 1991. 
* Non-voting chartered city to voting chartered city: Prior to 1980, all cities were just considered chartered cities, without any official category differentiating them aside from income levels. In 1964, when Cebu City's old charter ([http://www.chanrobles.com/commonwealthacts/commonwealthactno58.html Commonwealth Act 58]) was repealed and replaced with [http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno3857.html Republic Act 3857], its residents once more became eligible to vote for provincial officials. The city was among the first few to be classified as highly urbanized in 1980.

==League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP)==

The League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP) is a non-profit organization and is not a government agency. It has a membership of 118 cities and was founded in 1988. The organization was formed to help coordinate efforts to improve governance and local autonomy and to tackle issues such as preserving the environment and improving public works.

===City facts===
* By land area:
** ''Smallest:'' [[San Juan City|San Juan]], with an area of 5.94 square kilometers
** ''Largest:'' Both [[Davao City]] and [[Puerto Princesa]] claim to having an area ranging from 2,300 to more than 2,500 square kilometers. Contrary to popular belief within the Philippines, Davao City does not hold the record of being the [[List of cities by surface area|world's largest city in terms of land area]].
* By elevation:
** ''Lowest:'' Most Philippine cities are located on sea level. However, some parts of [[Navotas]], [[Caloocan]] and [[Malabon]] are below sea level, and continue to experience subsidence.<ref name="bsl">[http://www.congress.gov.ph/committees/commnews/commnews_det.php?newsid=218 Discussion on CAMANAVA control project continues]</ref>
** ''Highest:'' much of [[Baguio]] is situated more than 1,300 meters above sea level. However, part of [[Mount Apo]], the highest Philippine peak, is under Davao City's jurisdiction; the cities of [[Kidapawan]] and [[Digos]] both have claims on the territorial jurisdiction of the mountain too.
* By population (2007 census figures):
** ''Smallest:'' [[Palayan City]] (33,506)
** ''Largest:'' [[Quezon City]] (2,679,450)
* By population density (calculated using 2007 census figures):
** ''Most densely populated:'' [[Manila]], with 43,079 people per square kilometer
** ''Most sparsely populated:'' [[Puerto Princesa]], with around 70 to 81 people per square kilometer (calculated number depends on the land area figure used)

* Most extreme points:
** ''Northernmost:'' [[Laoag]]

** ''Westernmost:'' [[Puerto Princesa]]
** ''Easternmost:'' [[Bislig]], with [[Mati City|Mati]] at a close second

===Defunct/dissolved cities===
*Dagu-cala City (1947) - President Roxas issued [http://www.dagupan.com/city/history5.htm Executive Order No. 96] fixing the city limits of Dagupan to include the towns of [[San Fabian]] and [[Calasiao]] but the residents of Calasiao rejected inclusion into the new city, causing controversy over the election that was held on Nov. 10, 1947. The Dagu-cala dispute was brought before the Supreme Court of the Philippines which subsequently validated the election and ruled that Dagupan became a city on June 20, 1947, when Roxas signed the charter into law.
*Legazpi City (1948-1954) - Legazpi's cityhood was approved on June 18, 1948. Under [http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno306.html Republic Act 306], Legazpi was to become a city after the President of the Philippines proclaimed its cityhood. Comprising the present-day territories of [[Legazpi City]] and [[Daraga, Albay|Daraga]], the city was [http://www.angelfire.com/ar/Arimado/page2.html dissolved on June 8, 1954] when Legazpi and Daraga were made into separate municipalities. Legazpi eventually became a city on its own on June 12, 1959.
*Basilan City (1948-1973) - formerly part of the city of [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]] until it was made a city on its own in 1948. Converted to the province of [[Basilan]] in 1973 by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. 
*Rajah Buayan City (1966) - under [http://lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1965/ra_4413_1965.html Republic Act 4413], the then-municipality of General Santos in what was then the unified province of Cotabato was to be formally converted into a city named after Rajah Buayan (a former ruler in Mindanao) on January 1, 1966, provided that majority of qualified voters in the municipality vote in favor of cityhood in a plebiscite. In December 1965 the [[Commission on Elections]] (COMELEC) proclaimed the cityhood of Rajah Buayan, with 4,422 people voting for and 3,066 voting against. However, two residents of the new city challenged this by arguing in the courts that the number of people who voted in favor of cityhood did not form a majority in light of the fact that there were 15,727 voters in the city. The court issued an injunction on January 4, 1966 restraining city officers from performing any acts authorized by or pursuant to provisions in RA 4413. The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] [http://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1966/oct1966/gr_l-25469_1966.html unanimously upheld this decision on October 29, 1966] and declared that the city charter was not accepted by majority of voters, thus rendering RA4413 null and void. The municipality of General Santos would later be converted into a [[General Santos City|city under the same name]] in 1968.

====2008 Court annulment of 16 cities====
*The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]], by a highly divided vote of 6-5, on November 18, 2008, declared unconstitutional Cityhood Laws or Republic Acts (RAs) converting 16 municipalities into cities. The 24-page judgment of Justice Antonio T. Carpio, adjudged that "''the following Cityhood Laws violate secs. 6 and 10, Article X of the Constitution of the Philippines: RA Nos. 9389 (Baybay City in Leyte), 9390 (Bogo City in Cebu), 9391 (Catbalogan City in Samar), 9392 (Tandag City in Surigao del Sur), 9393 (Lamitan City in Basilan), 9394 (Borongan City in Samar), 9398 (Tayabas City in Quezon), 9404 (Tabuk City in Kalinga), 9405 (Bayugan City in Agusan del Sur), 9407 (Batac City in Ilocos Norte), 9408 (Mati City in Davao Oriental), 9409 (Guihulngan City in Negros Oriental), 9434 (Cabadbaran City in Agusan del Norte), 9435 (El Salvador City in Misamis Oriental), 9436 (Carcar City in Cebu), and 9491 (Naga City in Cebu)''." The Court held that the foregoing Cityhood Laws, all enacted after RA 9009's effectivity, "''explicitly exempt respondent municipalities from the increased income requirement from PhP20 million to PhP 100 million in sec. 450 of the Local Government Code (LGC), as amended by RA 9009''."<ref>[http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/news/courtnews%20flash/2008/11/11180803.php SC Voids 16 Cityhood Laws]</ref><ref>[http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=417028  From city back to town: Officials to appeal reversal of status]</ref>
