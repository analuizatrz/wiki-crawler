|}}Australian Hospital Ship '''AHS ''Centaur''''' was a former freighter and ocean liner converted to a [[hospital ship]] and attached to [[Australian]] naval forces during [[World War II]].

''Centaur'' was built at a cost of £146,750 [[Pound sterling|pounds sterling]] by [[Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Scott's Shipbuilding & Engineering Company]] in [[Greenock]], [[Scotland]], for service as a passenger vessel and cargo vessel for the Ocean Steamship Company (better known as Alfred Holt's [[Blue Funnel Line]]). ''Centaur's'' keel was laid on [[16 November]] [[1923]], and she entered operation on [[29 August]] [[1924]]. Beginning on the Blue Line's trade route from [[Fremantle, Western Australia]] to [[Singapore]], she continued in this role until 1943, when she was drafted as a hospital ship by Australian forces. On [[14 May]] [[1943]], ''Centaur'' was sunk off the coast of [[Queensland]] by a Japanese submarine.

==Design==
As ''Centaur'' was built specifically for the Fremantle to Singapore trade route, the first ship operated by Blue Funnel Line to be designed so, the capacity to carry cargo, passengers, and livestock was incorporated into the design. <ref name="Smith 9">Smith (1992). Pg. 9</ref> ''Centaur's'' hull was a [[Turret Deck Ship|'turret deck']] design; the reinforced flat bottom allowing the ship to rest on the ground without damage when low tides caused a port to run dry, a common occurrence in northern [[Western Australia]]. <ref name="Smith 9"/> A 35 ft (10.5 m) smokestack was included on the ship; as she was powered by a [[diesel engine]]; this overly large smokestack was more a concession to tradition than of any practical nature. <ref name="Smith 9"/> ''Centaur'' had four main holds, with two additional areas used interchangeably for livestock and cargo. <ref name="Smith 9"/>

Following her selection as a hospital ship for Australian forces in [[New Guinea]], ''Centaur'' was converted in [[Melbourne, Australia]]. Originally slated to cost £20,000 [[Australian pound]]s, the cost blew out to £55,000, after modifications to the conversion plans were made by multiple agencies, including the Army, Navy, and the [[trade union]]s of the ''Centaur's'' crew. <ref name="Smith 21">Smith (1992). Pg 21</ref> The cattle decks were converted to wards and bunkrooms, an operating theatre, dispensary, and dental office were installed, the weapons added at the beginning of the war were stripped, and 900 tons of [[iron stone]] were added as [[ballast]]. <ref name="Smith 21"/>

==Operational History==
===1924-1938===
''Centaur'' was the second ship of the name to serve the Blue Funnel Line. <ref name="Smith 9"/> She replaced ''Charon'' on the Fremantle-Singapore trade route, and continued on the run alone when ''Charon's'' sister ship, ''Gorgon'' was withdrawn from service in 1928. <ref name="Smith 13">Smith (1992). Pg. 13</ref> ''Centaur'' filled the profiles of both a [[tramp steamer]] and a [[freight liner (ship)|freight liner]], as while she was on a set route between Australia and Singapore, the ship would not call in at the same points on every journey. <ref name="Smith 13"/>

The highlight of ''Centaur's'' pre-war career was in November 1938, when she responded to a distress call from Japanese whale-chaser ''Kyo Maru''. <ref name="Smith 13"/> ''Centaur'' took ''Kyo Maru'' under tow, taking her to [[Geraldton, Western Australia]]. <ref name="Smith 13"/>

===1939-1942===
[[Image:Kormoran survivors (AWM 305987).jpg|thumb|left|170px|Survivors from [[German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran|HSK ''Kormoran'']] under tow in ''Centaur's'' lifeboats]]
Following the declaration of [[European Theatre of World War II|war in Europe]] on [[September 1]], 1939, all ships of the British [[Merchant Navy]] fell under the command of the British [[Admiralty]] on [[September 3]] [[1939]]. <ref name="Smith 15">Smith (1992). Pg. 15</ref> Initially, this did not affect ''Centaur'', and she was allowed to continue on her normal route of trade. <ref name="Smith 15"/>

On [[26 November]] [[1941]], ''Centaur'' encountered a lifeboat of survivors from the [[German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran|German auxiliary cruiser ''Kormoran'']], following its [[Battle between HMAS Sydney and HSK Kormoran|engagement with HMAS ''Sydney'']]. <ref name="Smith 16">Smith (1992). Pg 16</ref> Among the 62 survivors was ''Kormoran's'' captain, [[Theodore Detmers]]. <ref name="Smith 16"/> Unwilling to let a group of trained enemy soldiers aboard his vessel, the ship's [[Master Mariner|Master]], W.F. Dark, instructed his crew to lower food to the Germans, take on their nine wounded personnel, and then tow the rest in the lifeboat. <ref name="Smith 16"/> The damaged lifeboat was swamped, so two of ''Centaur's'' lifeboats were lowered for the Germans to ride in. <ref name="Smith 16"/> Upon arrival in [[Carnarvon, Western Australia]], the Germans were transferred to ''Centaur's'' number 1 hold, before they were placed under military custody and moved to a [[prisoner-of-war]] camp. <ref name="Smith 16"/>

Following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on [[2 December]] [[1941]], ''Centaur'' was taken off her route by the Admiralty and ordered to Sydney, where she began transfer runs from the east coast of Australia to [[New Guinea]]. <ref name="Smith 16"/> On these runs, she carried soldiers and war [[materiel]] for the beginning [[Pacific War]]. <ref name="Smith 16"/>

===1943===
Following the outbreak of hostilities in the Pacific, the Australian Government realised the need for a new hospital ship to be added to their forces, one smaller than the three ships used at the time to bring wounded back from the Middle East; [[AHS Manunda|AHS ''Manunda'']], [[AHS Wanganella|AHS ''Wanganella'']], and ''[[Angelina Lauro|Oranje]]''. <ref name="Smith 19">Smith (1992). Pg. 19</ref> No ship of the [[Australian Merchant Navy]] was suitable to operate in the confines of the [[Islands of Indonesia|Indonesian islands]]. <ref name="Smith 19"/> A request by the Australian Department of Defence to the British Admiralty resulted in the transfer of ''Centaur'' to Australian control on [[4 January]] 1943. <ref name="Smith 19"/> She was sent to Melbourne, and underwent a conversion to a [[Hospital Ship]], as defined by the [[Geneva Conventions]]. <Ref name="Smith 21"/>

Following the two-month conversion, which was completed at almost triple the original cost, AHS ''Centaur'' was capable of mercy voyages of up to 18 days without resupply, and could carry up to 280 cot-bound wounded in tropical conditions. <Ref name="Smith 21"/> ''Centaur'' was repainted red, white, and green, with [[Red Cross]] livery, and registered with the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] during the first week of February 1943, receiving the designation number 47 in Red Cross records. <ref>Smith (1992). Pg. 39, 66</ref>

''Centaur'' entered operation as a hospital ship on [[12 March]] 1943. <ref name="Smith 23">Smith (1992). Pg. 23</ref> The early stages of ''Centaur's'' first voyage as a hospital ship were test and transport runs; a mechanical shakedown run between [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]] and [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]] and a test run transporting wounded from [[Townsville, Australia|Townsville]] to [[Brisbane, Australia|Brisbane]] ensuring that the ship functioned as she had been modified to do, and was capable of fulfilling the role of a medical vessel. <ref name="Smith 23"/> Once this had been ascertained, ''Centaur'' was tasked with the delivery of medical personnel to [[Port Moresby]], New Guinea, returning to Brisbane with Australian and American wounded, along with a small number of prisoners of war. <ref name="Smith 24">Smith (1992). Pg. 24</ref>

Arriving in Sydney on [[8 May]] 1943, ''Centaur'' was re-provisioned at [[Darling Harbour]], before departing for Cairns, Queensland on [[12 May]] 1943. <ref name="Smith 25">Smith (1992). Pg. 25</ref> From there, her destination was again New Guinea. <ref name="Smith 25"/> On board at the time were 75 crew, 8 army officers, 12 army nurses, 45 other army personnel, 192 soldiers from 2/12 Army Field Ambulance, and 1 [[harbour pilot|ship pilot]]. <ref name="Smith 27">Smith (1992). Pg. 27</ref>

==Sinking==
At approximately 4.10 am on [[14 May]], [[1943]], while on her second run from [[Sydney]] to [[Port Moresby]], [[New Guinea]], ''Centaur'' was torpedoed by an unknown and unsighted submarine. <ref name="Smith 28">Smith (1992) Pg. 28</ref> The torpedo struck ''Centaur'' on the port side, igniting Centaur's fuel supply and sinking the ship in almost two kilometres of water. <ref name="Smith 29">Smith (1992). Pg. 29</ref> ''Centaur'' is recorded to have sunk at a point 24 nautical miles east-northeast of [[Point Lookout, Queensland|Point Lookout]], [[North Stradbroke Island]], [[Queensland]]. <ref>{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=A Critical Vulnerability - The Impact of the Submarine Threat on Australia’s Maritime Defence (1915-1954)|origdate= |origyear=2005 |origmonth=June |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/spc/maritimepapers/piama15/piama15_full.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |date= |year= |month= |publisher=Sea Power Centre – Australia |location= |language= |isbn=0-642-29625-1 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=p. 358 |chapter=Appendix V|chapterurl=http://www.navy.gov.au/spc/maritimepapers/piama15/piama15_appendices.pdf |quote= }}</ref> ''Centaur'' was submerged in less than three minutes, preventing the deployment of life rafts. <ref name="Smith 28"/> Several who escaped the ship were killed by shrapnel or burning fuel-oil. <ref name="HeraldTimeline">{{cite news |first=Tony |last=Stephens |title=Birthday beers spared George |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|url=http://www.smh.com.au/text/articles/2007/01/17/1168709825856.html |publisher=John Fairfax Holdings |page=20 |date=2007-01-18 |accessdate= |language= |quote= }}</ref>

Of the 332 persons onboard at the time of the sinking, only 64 survived. <ref name="Smith 34">Smith (1992). Pg 34</ref> These survivors remained adrift for thirty-six hours, drifting approximately 19.6 nautical miles north east of ''Centaur's'' calculated point of sinking. <ref>Smith (1992) Pg. 26</ref> During this time, several survivors claimed after the event to have heard the attacking submarine moving on the surface. <ref name="Smith 29"/> The submarine was visually sighted by the ship's cook, Francis Martin, who was floating alone and seperate from the main groups on a hatch cover. <ref name="Smith 29"/> Martin described the submarine to Naval Intelligence following the survivors' return to land; his description matching the profile of a [[Kaidai class submarine|''Kaidai'' class submarine]] (KD7 type) of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. <ref name="Smith 29"/> Identification of the submarine responsible was not possible until 1979, when the Japanese Government revealed in an official war history that the ''Kaidai'' class [[Japanese submarine I-177|I-177]], commanded by Lieutenant Commander Hajime Nakagawa, was the responsible vessel. <ref name="Smith 29"/> <ref name="HeraldTimeline"/>

The survivors were spotted by an [[Avro Anson]] aircraft, who directed [[United States Navy]] ship [[USS Mugford (DD-389)|USS ''Mugford'']] to the location of the sinking. <ref>Smith (1992). Pg. 33</ref> ''Mugford'' reported the rescue effort underway at 2.14 pm on [[15 May]], and returned to Brisbane around midnight of the same day. <ref name="Smith 34"> Amongst those recovered were 1 Army nurse (the only female survivor), 1 Army doctor, and the ship pilot. <ref name="Smith 34"> There was only one survivor amongst those quartered on the port side of the ship. <ref name="HeraldTimeline"/>

Later searches were conducted for more survivors. The first was performed on the evening of the [[15 May]] by ''Mugford's'' sister ship, [[USS Helm (DD-388)|USS ''Helm'']]. <ref name="Smith 34"> The second began on the morning of [[16 May]], with the waters off [[North Stradbroke Island]] searched for five days by [[HMAS Lithgow (J206)|HMAS ''Lithgow'']] and four [[motor torpedo boat]]s. <ref>Smith (1992) Pg. 35</ref> Neither search resulted in the discovery of additional survivors.

===Reaction===
[[Image:Centaur_(ARTV09088).jpg|200px|thumb|left|A wartime poster calling for Australians to avenge the sinking of ''Centaur'']]
The sinking of ''Centaur'' drew strong reactions from General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and Australian Prime Minister [[John Curtin]], <ref name="HeraldTimeline"/> as the ship had been illuminated and marked as a hospital ship as per the [[Geneva Conventions]], and the act of sinking a ship so marked was considered to be a [[war crime]].

''Centaur'' became a symbol of Australia's determination to win a war against what appeared to be a brutal and uncompromising enemy. Posters depicting the sinking began to appear in mid-1943, calling for Australians to "Avenge the Nurses" by working to produce materiel, purchasing [[war bond]]s, or enlisting in the armed forces. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dva.gov.au/media/publicat/2003/centaur/comm.htm |title=Sinking of the Centaur - Commemoration |accessdate=2007-02-20 |work=DVA.gov.au - Commemorative Publications |publisher=Australian Government - Department of Veteran's Affairs}}</ref>

Initially, Japan stated that the attack was in retaliation for American aerial attacks on two of their own hospital ships, <ref name="Smith 39">Smith (1992) Pg. 39</ref> although they did not make clear at the time which submarine had been responsible for the attack on ''Centaur''. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/encyclopedia/centaur/index.htm |title=Sinking of the Centaur |accessdate=2007-02-07 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Australian War Memorial |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> Very little information was forthcoming on the events until the publication of Japan's war history in 1979.

==Memorial==
[[Image:AU AHS Centaur mem.jpg|thumb|right|'''''Centaur''''' memorial, Point Danger, [[Coolangatta, Queensland]].]]
A memorial to ''Centaur'' was unveiled on the 50th anniversary of the sinking, [[14 May]] [[1993]], at Point Danger, [[Coolangatta, Queensland]]. It consists of a monumental stone topped with a cairn, surrounded by a tiled moat with memorial plaques explaining the commemoration. The memorial is in turn surrounded by a park with a boardwalk, overlooking the sea, that has plaques for other ships lost during World War II, including both Merchant and [[Royal Australian Navy]] ships. A total of 34 ships were attacked off the east coast of Australia by ships, submarines, and naval mines; of these 13 were torpedoed but did not sink; of the 4 struck by mines, 1 sank.

The unveiling of the memorial was performed by Minister for Veteran's Affairs, [[Australian Senate|Senator]] the Honourable [[John Faulkner]]. Apart from Australian survivors and local dignitaries, a contingent from USS ''Mugford'' travelled from the [[United States]] for the event.

Although the memorial at Point Danger is considered to be the primary commemoration of the incident, several other tributes were made prior to 1993, all of which still exist. These include: a [[cairn]] at [[Caloundra, Queensland]], erected by the local [[Rotary International|Rotary International Club]], a [[stained glass]] memorial window and plaque listing the names of those lost in the attack at [[Concord Repatriation General Hospital]], and the naming of the "Centaur Ward" at [[Heidelberg Repatriation General Hosiptal]]. <ref name="Smith 39"/>
