==History==
[[Image:Woodburn hall wvu.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Woodburn hall is the oldest building at West Virginia University and has long since been a symbol of the university.]]
 
Under the terms of the 1862 [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]], the West Virginia Legislature created the Agricultural College of West Virginia on February 7, 1867.<ref>Doherty, William T. Jr. and Festus P. Summers. (1982) West Virginia University: Symbol of Unity in a Sectionalized State. Morgantown, West Virginia: West Virginia University Press, page 8.</ref> On December 4, 1868, lawmakers re-named it West Virginia University.<ref>Doherty, William T. Jr. and Festus P. Summers. (1982) West Virginia University: Symbol of Unity in a Sectionalized State. Morgantown, West Virginia: West Virginia University Press, page 11.</ref>

In the 1990s, WVU developed several recreational activities for the students, such as FallFest, a concert that welcomes students back to classes. In 1998, WVUp All Night launched to offer free weekend entertainment to students. The Student Recreation Center was completed in July 2001. A popular Student Recreation Center opened in 2001.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

WVU is designated as a Research University (High Research Activity) by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.<ref> [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=63&search_flag=true&ref=783&start=783&BASIC2005=16 Carnegie Classifications]</ref> Funding from external sources for total sponsored programs is $138 million.<ref> [http://about.wvu.edu/facts WVU Facts]</ref> WVU is affiliated with the Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute, dedicated to the study of Alzheimer's and other diseases that affect the brain.<ref>[http://www.brni.org/ Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute - Welcome<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> WVU is also a leader in biometric technology research and recently became the Federal Bureau of Investigation's lead academic partner in biometrics research.<ref>[http://about.wvu.edu/recognition About WVU | Recognition | West Virginia University<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On April 13, 2007, the Board of Governors voted 16-1 to elect Morgantown attorney [[Michael Garrison]] to succeed David Hardesty as the University's president.<ref>[http://www.da.wvu.edu/show_article.php?&story_id=27530 ''Daily Athenaeum'' (April 16, 2007): "Garrison selected to be next WVU president", by Huong Le and Ry Rivard]</ref>  The Faculty Senate voted to work with Garrison, but approved a vote of no confidence in the search.<ref>[http://www.da.wvu.edu/show_article.php?&story_id=28841 ''Daily Athenaeum'' (May 23, 2007): "Faculty Senate votes 'no confidence'", by Tricia Fulks]</ref> Garrison began work in July; his appointment officially began September 1, 2007.<ref>[http://sundaygazettemail.com/section/News/2007071718 ''The Charleston Gazette'' (July 18, 2007): "WVU governors speed up takeover date for president"]</ref> 

Garrison's early initiatives, including move forward to build a campus child care center after three decades of discussion on the subject and working with the Board of Governors to approve the largest salary increase since 1993 won him praise from many faculty and staff members.<ref> [http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/feb/21/w-va-school-leader-quickly-made-grade/ "W.

In June 2008 Garrison announced plans to resign in September 2008. According to the ''Washington Post'', Garrison sought to "end a scandal stemming from the university's awarding of an unearned degree to the governor's daughter."<ref>{{cite news |first=Robin |last=Shulman |authorlink=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/staff/email/robin+shulman/ |title=Scandal Prompts WVU President to Resign |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/06/AR2008060603829.html?nav=emailpage  |publisher=Washington Post |date=7 June 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-10 }}</ref>  C.

===Forensics program===
In addition to its 15 colleges and schools, WVU also has a nationally recognized [[forensic science]] program. Originally created through a partnership with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the program is accredited by the [[American Academy of Forensic Sciences]] and is the official library holdings repository for the [[International Association for Identification]].

The program focuses on these aspects of forensics:
*[[Forensic accounting]] and [[fraud]]
*[[Forensic entomology]]
*[[Bloodstain pattern analysis]] and Biological Evidence aging
*[[Criminology]] and Investigative Science
*[[Dactylography]] and Fractal Analysis of Fingerprints
*[[Forensic toxicology]]
*[[Forensic odontology]]
*[[Computer forensics]] and Database Research
*Forensic Textile Research

Forensic facilities include "crime-scene" houses and vehicles that can be altered and adapted to give students hands-on experience, as well as traditional laboratories and classrooms which are now housed in the recently renovated Ming Hsieh Hall adjacent to Oglebay Hall. A separate Criminology & Investigative Sciences major was later added.

===Biometrics===
West Virginia University was the first in the world to establish a [[bachelor of science]] degree in Biometric Systems. In 2003 the university also founded the initial chapter of the Student Society for the Advancement of Biometrics(SSAB).<ref>[http://www.csee.wvu.edu/ssab/about.html SSAB WVU Chapter]</ref> The program, located in the Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (LCSEE), provides a firm understanding of the underlying [[electrical engineering]] and [[computer engineering]] disciplines that support [[biometric]] applications. 

On February 6, 2008, WVU became the national academic leader for the [[FBI]]'s biometric research.<ref>[http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel08/wvu_fbi_020608.htm FBI Press]</ref>
WVU is also the founding site for the Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR), focusing on biometrics and [[Digital identity| identification technology]]. The university maintains and develops collaborative relationships with other academic institutions to meet research needs.<ref>[http://www.citer.wvu.edu/ CITeR]</ref>

===Health Sciences===
[[Image:rubyHSC.jpg|thumb|200px|Health Sciences Campus]]
West Virginia University’s [[Robert C. Byrd]] Health Sciences Center is located on the Evansdale Campus and houses the Schools of Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, and Pharmacy.  These schools grant doctoral and professional degrees in 16 different fields, as well as a variety of other [[Master's degree|Master's]] and [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]] degrees.<ref name="Majors">{{cite web|url=http://www.wvu.edu/majors/index.html|title=Majors Listed by College & School|publisher=[[West Virginia University]]|accessdate=2008-11-24}}</ref> For 2009, [[U.S. News and World Report]] ranked WVU’s Medical School ninth overall in the nation for rural medicine.<ref>[http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/grad/med/rural usnews.com: Medical Specialty Rankings: Rural medicine]</ref>

Also located on the Health Sciences Campus is WVUs teaching hospital; Ruby Memorial Hospital which is one of only two designated Truma I hospitals in the state and has also been designated a magnet hospital for it's ability to attract and retain high quality nursing staff.

==Libraries==

[[Image:Downtown library.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Wise Library on the downtown campus is West Virginia University's main library.]]
The University maintains seven libraries on its campuses (six of which are in Morgantown and the other in Charleston). These include the Downtown Campus Library, Evansdale Library, Health Sciences Library, Law Library, Math Library, Media Services, and the WVU Charleston Health Sciences Library. Collections include the Appalachian Collection, Book Depository, Digital Collections, Government Documents, West Virginia Historical Art Collection, Map Room, Myers Collection, Patent and Trademarks, Rare Books Collections, and Theses and Dissertations. West Virginia University libraries contain nearly 1.5 million printed volumes, 2.3 million microforms, more than 10,000 electronic journals, and computers with high speed Internet access.<ref>[http://www.libraries.wvu.edu/friends/ West Virginia Collection Welcome Page]</ref>

In addition, the [[West Virginia and Regional History Collection]], the world's largest collection of West Virginia related research material, is in the Wise Library on the Downtown Campus. According to the university<ref>[http://www.libraries.wvu.edu/collections/wv.htm West Virginia Collection General Information]</ref>, the collection includes over 4,500,000 [[manuscript]] documents, 30,000 books, 15,000 pamphlets, 1,200 [[newspapers]], 100,000 [[photographs]] and prints, 5,000 maps, and 25,000 [[microfilm]]s, [[oral histories]], films and [[folk music]] recordings. It is often called simply the "West Virginia Collection." 

In 2007, the Princeton Review ranked West Virginia University libraries 5th best of 366 college libraries surveyed.

The university co-publishes, with the [[United Association for Labor Education]], ''[[Labor Studies Journal]]''.

==Campus==
[[Image:MountainlairWVU2008.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Mountainlair]] Student Union is a popular place for students on campus.]]
The Morgantown campus comprises three sub-campuses. The original main campus, typically called the Downtown Campus, is in the Monongahela River valley on the fringes of Morgantown. This part of campus includes eight academic buildings on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The Downtown Campus comprises several architectural styles predominantly featuring red brick including Victorian Second Empire, Federal, Neoclassical, and Collegiate Gothic among others. The Evansdale Campus, a mile and a half north-northwest, on a rise above the flood plain of the [[Monongahela River]], was developed in the 1950s and 1960s to accommodate a growing student population, since space for expansion was limited at the Downtown Campus. The Health Sciences Campus, in the same outlying area (but on the other side of a ridge), includes the WVU Health Sciences Center, Ruby Memorial Hospital, Chestnut Ridge Hospital, Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center, UHA Physicians Office Center, Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute and, WVU Eye Institute, WVU Center on Aging, and WVU Children's Hospital.

The Health Sciences Campus is located near [[Mountaineer Field]] on the Evansdale Campus of WVU.

==Campus transportation==
===Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit===
{{main|Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit}}
[[Image:Morgantown PRT - Beechurst Station.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The PRT shuttles students to and from WVU's Health Sciences, Evansdale, and Downtown Campuses.]]
Because of WVU's distributed campuses (Downtown, Evansdale, and Health Sciences), the [[Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit|Personal Rapid Transit]] system, which has become a local showpiece, was built to link them. [[Boeing]] began construction on the Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) system in [[Morgantown, West Virginia]] in 1972. The unique aspect that makes the system "personal" is that a rider can tell the system which station is the destination and then he/she will be directed to a car that is bound only for that station.

WVU students, faculty and staff ride by paying a per-semester fee; they swipe their magnetically-encoded ID cards through the turnstiles when entering the stations. Others pay a cash fare of $0.50. The PRT began operation in 1973, with U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]]'s daughter, Tricia, aboard one of five prototype cars for a demonstration ride.<ref name="prt">[http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/news/page/4104/ WVU News and Information Services (July 13, 2004 press release): "WVU PRT Station to Bear Name of People-Mover's Creator"]</ref>. The PRT handles 16,000 riders per day (as of 2005) and uses approximately 70 cars.

The system has {{convert|8.7|mi}} of guideway track and five stations: Walnut, Beechurst, Engineering, Towers, and Medical/Health Sciences. The vehicles are rubber-tired, but the cars have constant contact with a separate electrified rail. [[Steam]] heating keeps the elevated guideway free of snow and ice. Although most students use the PRT, this technology has not been replicated at other sites for various reasons, including the high cost of maintaining the heated track system in winter.{{Fact|date=September 2008}}

The PRT cars are painted in the school colors (blue with gold trim) and feature the University name and logo on the front. Inside, the seats are light beige [[fiberglass]] and the carpeting is blue. Each car has eight seats with an overall capacity of 20 people, including standing room. 

The [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] named the WVU PRT one of the top 10 engineering achievements of 1972,<ref name="prt" /> and in 1998 ''The New Electric Railway Journal'' picked the WVU PRT as the best [[people mover]].<ref name="prt" />

In 2006, the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] and [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] dubbed WVU one of the best workplaces for commuters.<ref>[http://www.nis.wvu.edu/2006/workplace_award.htm "WVU Named One of 'Best Workplaces' for Commuters by EPA, DOT]</ref>

Each autumn, during Mountaineer Week celebrations, a special PRT car is placed in front of the [[Mountainlair]] [[student activity center|student union]] where groups of students participate in the "PRT Cram" with the objective of squeezing in as many people as possible. A record of 97 was set in 2000.<ref name='wolfe2005'>{{cite news | first=Billy | last=Wolfe | coauthors= | title=PRT Cram | date=[[2005-11-01]] | publisher= | url =http://www.da.wvu.edu/show_article.php?&story_id=19842 | work =The Daily Athenaeum | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-06 | language = }}</ref>

===Buses and shuttles===
In addition to the PRT system, students can utilize University-operated buses (during limited hours) or take advantage of the community's Mountain Line, which operates every day into the early morning hours. Students can use their Mountaineer Card to ride the Mountain Line bus for free. 

The Health Science Center also operates a shuttle service to help students, visitors and patients to get to and from the Health Science Center campus. Many non-University, private student housing communities in the area also operate a shuttle to campus/town and back to the housing community. 

==Fraternity and sorority life==
[[Image:greek-games.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Greek Games on [[Mountainlair]] Plaza during WVU's annual Greek Week]]
About 10-15 percent of West Virginia's students are involved in Greek life. Many of the fraternity houses are on High Street or North Spruce Street, while sorority houses are mainly on Spruce Street and Prospect Street. 

According to the University, there are 17 fraternities and 8 sororities at WVU. Following is a list of those that belong to the Inter-Fraternity Council and the [[National Panhellenic Conference]] (sororities).  <ref>[http://www.arc.wvu.edu/NSS/AdmissionsFAQ/studentactivities.html WVU :: Undergraduate Student Recruitment - Admissions FAQ: Student Activities<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In recent years, many of the houses, as noted on the list, have been closed or condemned for various reasons.

Recently West Virginia University has begun purchasing some of the fraternity houses located near campus. This is a small step in a several year plan, which when complete, will leave the University in control of many of the Greek organizations. The plan has both pros and cons. The Greek organizations who are finding it more and more difficult to maintain their houses according to Morgantown City Code are getting the repairs and financial support they need. In return the University is able to govern their behavior.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

===The Daily Athenaeum===
''The Daily Athenaeum'', nicknamed the ''DA'', is the 9th-largest newspaper in West Virginia. <ref>[http://www.da.wvu.edu/new/print_edition/rate_card/rate_card_07_08.pdf Daily Athenaeum 2007-2008 Rate Card]</ref> Offered free around campus, it generates income through advertisements. The paper began in 1887 as a weekly [[literary magazine]], with writing, editing and production taken over by the newly formed School of Journalism in the 1920s. In 1970, the paper split from the School of Journalism and became an independent campus entity governed by the Student Publications Board. The ''DA'' was voted as the ''[[Princeton Review]]'s'' 10th-best college newspaper in the United States in 2005, 15th in 2006, and 8th in 2007.<ref>[http://www.princetonreview.com Princeton Review Homepage (Login Required)]</ref>

===Sports traditions===
====Flying WV====
[[Image:WestVirginiaMountaineers.png|thumb|right|The "Flying WV"]]
West Virginia University's logo is known as the "Flying WV."  It originally debuted in 1980 as a part of a football uniform redesign by Coach [[Don Nehlen]].  It was adopted as the official logo for the University in 1983.<ref name="FlyingWV">{{cite news|url=http://www.wtrf.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&storyid=4362|title=A Mark to Remember: Flying WV|last=Forinash|first=Danny|date=2005-08-04|publisher=[[WTRF-TV]]|accessdate=2008-11-21}}</ref>

====Mountaineer mascot====
The Mountaineer was adopted in 1890 as the official school mascot and unofficially began appearing at sporting events in 1927. The new Mountaineer is selected each year by the Mountain Honorary during the final two men's home basketball games. Candidates must have at least a 2.5 GPA, write an essay about why they want to be the Mountaineer, attend an extensive interview process and garner the most cheers during the home basketball game. The successful candidate is awarded the formal title of "The Mountaineer of West Virginia University." Although men typically are chosen, there has been one woman selected (Natalie Tennant). The new Mountaineer receives a scholarship, a tailor-made buckskin suit with coonskin hat, and a period rifle and powder horn for discharging when appropriate and safe. The mascot travels with most sports teams throughout the academic year. There is always a backup Mountaineer, to step in when needed.

===="Take Me Home, Country Roads"====
The [[John Denver]] song "[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]" is commonly played at most home sporting events as well as other occasions on campus. In 1980, Denver helped dedicate the new Mountaineer Field, and performed the song as a sing-along with the crowd. It then became a tradition, after a victory, for fans to stay in the stands and sing it along with the football team.<ref>''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' (month n.a., 2006): "102 More Things You Gotta Do Before You Graduate"</ref>

====Carpet roll====
[[Image:carpet-roll.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Carpet roll at a men's basketball game]]
In 1955, Fred Schaus and Alex Mumford devised the idea of rolling out an elaborate gold and blue carpet for Mountaineer basketball players to use when taking the court for pre-game warm-ups. In addition, Mountaineer players warmed up with a special gold and blue basketball. The University continued this tradition until the late 1960s when it died out, but former Mountaineer player [[Gale Catlett]] reintroduced the carpet when he returned to West Virginia University in 1978 as head coach of the men's basketball team.

===Mountaineer Marching Band===

On April 24, 2008, the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' reported that the university had improperly granted an [[MBA]] degree to [[Heather Bresch]], the daughter of the state's governor [[Joe Manchin]] and an employee of [[Mylan]], Inc., the university's largest donor. Bresch was awarded a degree by having six grades changed from incomplete to "A", on the basis of her "work experience"; until that change, she had completed only 22 of the required 48 credits. Following release of a report written by a panel led by faculty members from WVU, the university announced in April 2008 that it would rescind Bresch's degree.<ref name=postgazette>Len Boselovic and Patricia Sabatini, "[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08115/876164-298.stm University revokes degree after scathing report on M.B.A. awarded to Bresch]", ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', 24 April 2008, accessed [[2008-04-26]]</ref>
