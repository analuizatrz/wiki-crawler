'''Boden Fortress''', or ''Bodens fästning'', is a recently [[decommission]]ed [[fortress]] surrounding the city of [[Boden Municipality|Boden]], in northern [[Sweden]]. During the [[20th century]] the fortress was a top secret installation and neither the exact size nor the capabilities of the fortress was public knowledge.

Five of the mountains surrounding Boden were at the turn of the [[19th century]] chosen to house the large fortress constellation. The fortress consists of a number of self-supporting [[fort]]s excavated out of the [[bedrock]]; the building cost for these underground installations was astronomical. The intended use for the fortress was as a barrier against an invasion from [[Russia]] and later [[Soviet Union]] through [[Finland]]. Until the [[1960s]] part of the [[Swedish gold reserve]] was stored there. The last shots from the [[artillery]] cannons were fired in [[1997]] and in [[1998]] the entire fortress was decommissioned. Some of the forts are today open to the public as [[tourist attraction]]s.
