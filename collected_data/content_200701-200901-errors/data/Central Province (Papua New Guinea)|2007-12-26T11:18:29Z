'''Central Province''' is a province in [[Papua New Guinea]] located on the southern coast of the country. It has a population of 183,983 ([[2000]] census) people and is 29,500 km square in size. The provincial capital of Central Province is [[Port Moresby]], which is also the national capital and is technically located in the [[National Capital District, Papua New Guinea|National Capital District]] rather than Central Province itself.  On 9 October 2007, the Central Province government announced plans to build a new provincial capital city at [[Bautama]], which lies within Central Province near Port Moresby.<ref> {{cite news|publisher=[http://www.thenational.com.pg/ The National] |date=[[2007-10-09]] |url=http://www.thenational.com.pg/100907/Nation%202.htm |title=K300m Central capital to emerge at Bautama|accessdate=2007-10-09 }}</ref>

Whereas [[Tok Pisin]] is the main [[lingua franca]] in all Papua New Guinean towns, in part of the southern mainland coastal area centred on Central Province, [[Hiri Motu]] is a stronger lingua franca (but not in Port Moresby).
