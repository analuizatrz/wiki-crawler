'''Munster''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: ''An Mhumhain'', {{IPA2|ənˈvuːnʲ}}, ''Cúige Mumhan'' or ''Mumha'') is the southernmost of the four [[provinces of Ireland]]. The largest city in Munster is [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. 


== History ==

The name is derived from the Celtic goddess, [[Muma]]. The province was once divided into six regions: Tuadh Mhuman (North Munster), Deas Mhuman (South Munster), Urh Mumhan (East Munster), Iar mumhan (West Munster), Ernaibh Muman (the Ernai tribe's portion of Munster), and Deisi Muman (the Deisi tribe's portion of Munster). Ultimately, these were all subsumed into the kingdoms of [[Thomond]] (North Munster), [[County Desmond|Desmond]] (South Munster), and [[Ormond (ancient Irish kingdom)|Ormond]] (East Munster), all of which were eventually subsumed by surrender and regrant as Earldoms in the [[Peerage of Ireland]]. 
The names exist only indirectly today, particularly in the case of [[Thomond]]. The three [[crown (headgear)|crowns]] represent these three kingdoms.  This flag can easily be confused with the flag of [[Dublin]] which has three [[castle]]s in a similar pattern on a blue background; it also resembles the lesser [[coat-of-arms]] of [[Sweden]], the [[Three Crowns]].

[[Maurice FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Desmond]] (d. 1356), was described as the "ruler of Munster" in his lifetime.

In 1841 before the Great Famine, there were just under three million people living in the province of Munster, but the population dropped devastatingly low due to mass emigration in the 1840s and continued emigration up until the 1980s.

For 30 days during the [[Irish Civil War]], the province of Munster broke away from the Irish Free State and established the [[Munster Republic]] in opposition to the acceptance of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The Munster Republic was short lived and subsequently crushed by heavily-armed [[Irish Free State]] forces.

==Economy==

The province of Munster contributes 40 billion euro (US$52.57bn) to Irish GDP (25% of total Irish GDP) (2004) (greater than the [[Economy of Northern Ireland]] 37.3bn euro) (See "GDP stats" below). Munster also is wealthier than [[Slovenia]] (pop. 2m), [[Lithuania]] (pop. 3.5m), [[Latvia]] (pop. 2.5m) and [[Kenya]] (pop. 35m). Munster is the home to many modern capital intensive, highly productive private sector enterprises.   

The [[Economy of Cork]] and [[Economy of Limerick]] are the main engines of the province's economy. The Cork harbour area was the centre of Ireland's heavy industry manufacturing sector. Cork had a steel mill, a shipyard, a car assembly plant, a tyre plant, a deep harbour, and a thriving textile sector in the mid twentieth century. (Cork people are proud to point out that this was greater than any other Irish city including Belfast, which did not figure in the automotive industry). However heavy taxes, excessive regulation, competition from larger centres of economic activity, and the sudden removal of protective tarifs upon membership of the European Economic Community caused a decline in the 1970s. Cork was Ireland's [[rust belt]] city in the 1980s, as heavy industry moved out, and newer sectors tried to get established in as unemployment peaked. 
 
Munster was the home of 'The Munster and Leinster Bank', which is parent of Ireland's richest and largest bank [[Allied Irish Bank]]. Cork, in Munster, is also home of the two largest Irish owned retailing organizations, [[Dunnes Stores]], and the [[Musgrave Group]]. Cork is also home to two of the three Irish stout brands; Murphy's Irish stout, and Beamish, as well as the 'Paddy' brand of Irish whiskey. 

Shannon airport, a rich music tradition, the best food from land and sea, and landscapes of international renown, have all been influential in the development of the tourist sector in Munster. 

===Power generation===

The majority of the Republic's power stations are located in Munster.

Ireland's only oil refinery and oil storage facility is still located at [[Whitegate]]. 

The majority of Ireland's gas production comes from [[Kinsale Head]] in County Cork, from where it is transported by pipeline across the country.

===I.T & Pharmaceutical Industry===

Munster is one of Ireland's most important [[I.T.]] hubs with such multinationals as Apple, Intel, Amazon and Dell locating in the province. The [[Atlantic Quarter]] in Cork is a new plan to create a smaller version of Dublin's [[IFSC]] in Cork docklands. In Kerry, [[FEXCO]] Financial Services in [[Killorglin]] is a foreign exchange and global payments group.<ref name="itimes-20080307">{{cite news

Munster has developed into the centre of Ireland's Pharmaceutical industry. The province plays an ever greater role in the bio-pharmaceutical industry and is successful in fighting off stiff competition from Switzerland and Singapore for inward investments in the bio-pharmaceutical area in companies such as Amgen and Pfizer and Roche(located in Clarecastle Co.Clare).<ref>[http://www.roche.ie/ Roche Ireland pharmaceuticals & healthcare Clarecastle Co Clare Ireland<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
