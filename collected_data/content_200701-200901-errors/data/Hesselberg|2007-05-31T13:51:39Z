{{Wikipedia:Translation/Hesselberg}}

The '''Hesselberg''' (689 m above sea level) is the highest elevation of [[Middle Franconia]] and the [[Franconian Jura]] and is situated 60 km south western of [[Nuremberg]]. The mountain stands isolated and far away from the center of the Franconian Jura, in its southwestern border region, 4 km to the north west of [[Wassertrüdingen]]. The first traditional name was ''Öselberg'', which derived probably from ''öder Berg'' (bleak mountain). This name later changed to ''Eselsberg'' and finally to the actual name ''Hesselberg''. As an old ''[[Zeugenberg]]'' the mountain provides an informative insight into [[Jurassic]] geology. It is also witness of an eventful history. Many incidents were handed down from generation to generation and — mixed with facts — have become legends. Nowadays many people visit the Hesselberg in order to enjoy nature and the wonderful vista, which — during clear air — enables looking onto the [[alps]] that are 150 km away.

==Shape, location, and dimension==
The mountain has a length of approximately 6 km and an average width of 1 to 2 km. All slopes — excepting the southern side — are covered with [[coniferous forest|coniferous]] or [[mixed forest]]. In the upper part, and especially at the eastern slope of the ''Röckinger mountain'', there are large areas of [[deciduous forest]]. The upper part of the prominent southern side is free of forest. In the southern and in the north eastern slope there are large areas of neglected grassland with their typical [[Juniper]] bushes. The Hesselberg can be divided into 5 sections by its center-line (see panorama image).

*In the western slope there is mainly coniferous forest. Here is the starting point for the geological [[nature trail]].
*The western [[plateau]], also called ''Gerolfinger mountain'', with its [[sinkhole]]-like depressions, [[hedge (barrier)|hedges]] and [[shrub]]s, and a few vistas, has an especially natural appearance. But the depressions are not natural, they are the result of former [[excavation]]. The material was used for road construction and lime burning.
*since 1994 the middle part, the so-called ''Ehinger mountain'', with the main peak and the transmitter tower is accessible again; before there was a restricted military area of the [[United States Army]].
*The touristically most important part is the woodless eastern plateau, which is called ''Osterwiese'' or ''Röckinger mountain''. This section serves as starting place for [[model plane]]s and [[hang-glider]]s, it is also an observation platform, ideal for strolling. On days with especially clear air one can see the alps with the [[Zugspitze]].
*The eastern foothills, that are shrouded in legends, are highly aforested; this section has the name ''Schlössleinsbuck''. This small hill top is also called ''Small Hesselberg''. The ''Röckinger mountain'' and the ''Schlössleinsbuck'' are separated by the ''[[Druid]]'s valley''.

==Origin and geological structure== 
The Hesselberg is among the most important [[geotopes]] in [[Bavaria]]. On September 24<sup>th</sup> 2005 it was awarded the cachet ''Bayerns schönste Geotope'' (Bavarian's most beautiful geotopes) by Georg Schlapp (director of the Bavarian Environmental Protection Office) in the course of a ceremony.

===Jurassic origin===
200 million years ago the [[Jurassic]] sea extended from the [[North Sea]] basin far to the South and covered the [[late Triassic]] land. At that time the Hesselberg region was on the border of that sea. Many [[afflux]]es brought huge masses of [[rubble]] from the eastern mainland and formed a multilayer seafloor, which had a rich [[flora]] and [[fauna]]. During more than 40 million years the different layers of Jurassic rock consecutively deposited: the Black Jurassic ([[early Jurassic|Lias]]) at the bottom, the Brown Jurassic ([[middle Jurassic|Dogger]]) above, and the White Jura ([[late Jurassic|Malm]]) at the top. Each of these layers is characterised by the typical rock and the embedded [[fossil]]s, which are specific for each era. Due to the fact that certain fossils are solely found in certain layers, they are referred to as [[index fossil]]s. In Jurassic rock [[ammonite]]s are the index fossils. In the course of time the Jurassic sea silted up completely. Due to the fact that the Hesselberg is located in the sheltering basin of the Early Jurassic, it was not that much corroded by wind and water as the plain between the mountain and the [[Hahnenkamm (Altmühltal)|Hahnenkamm]]. The hard rock resisted and left the Hesselberg as a distinctive [[Zeugenberg]] rising above the landscape like an island. This kind of mountain-formation is called [[relief inversion]] in [[geology]].

===The rock layers of the mountain===
The information signs of the geological nature trail are descriptivly explaining the origin of the mountain. Each of the three main parts of the Jurassic era is divided into six sub-divisions, which are numbered with [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]] [[alpha]] to [[zeta]] ([[Friedrich August Quenstedt|Quenstedt]]'s classification). The rocks that are found in the different layers are assigned to this classification.

====The layers of the Early Jurassic (Lias)====
The dark colors of [[clay]] and [[marl]] give name to the Black Jurassic. This layer is approximately 50 m thick and forms the fertile hilly vicinity of the mountain. Its lowest sub-layers (Lias alpha to gamma) are beneath the surface. The [[Amaltheenton]] (Lias delta) with its 35 m is the thickest sub-layer of the Lias. A special feature is the Posidonia [[schist]] (Lias epsilon), which is 10 m thick. In this sub-layer there are fossils from bigger animals too; for example [[ichthyosaur]]s were found. The cavity of the Posidonia schist, which is at the starting point of the nature trail, is unique and a geological natural monument. Therefore it is prohibited to search for and to collect fossils. On these well visible schist layers lies the Jurassic marl (Lias zeta), which is 2.7 m thick.

====The layers of the Middle Jurassic (Dogger)====
The dark brown colors of the [[weathering|weathered]] upper layers give name to the Brown (or Middle) Jurassic. The colors are a result of high concentrated [[iron]]. The layer of the Dogger with its 135 m forms the main part of Hesselberg's slopes. The lowest sub-layer (Dogger alpha) is the Opalinus-clay, which is 75 m thick. The unevenness of the meadows is the result of landslides; the soil of these part is very susceptible to slides. On top of Opalinus-clay lies a layer of iron [[sandstone]] (Dogger beta), which is 40 m thick. This layer is very distinctive due to its steep climb. Due to the fact that the Opalinus-clay is impervious to water, a [[spring horizon]] has formed at the transition to the iron sandstone. The layers of Dogger gamma ([[Sowerby]] layers) (1 m), Dogger delta ([[Ostreen]]-lime) (4 m), and Dogger epsilon ([[Oolith]]-lime) (2 m) are summarized under the term "ooliths". These layers contain a lot of fossils. On the very top of the Middle Jurassic layers is the Ornate's clay (Dogger zeta), which is only 2 m thick. This small layer forms a terrace around the Hesselberg. On its southern side the buildings of the [[folk high school]] were constructed.

====The layers of the Late Jurassic (Malm)====
The topmost Jurassic layer is named after its light color (White Jurassic). These layers can gain an thickness of 400 m in the Franconian Jura, but at the Hesselberg they are ablated for the most part; only 85 m are conserved. The rocks of the Malm partly are [[sediments]] of the sea, partly they are [[coral reef|reefs]] of ancient [[sea sponge]]s. This rock is widely distributed on the main peak. The light-colored [[lime]] of the White Jurassic was a popular building material for houses ([[Calcium oxide|burnt lime]]) and for road construction ([[rubble]]). The depressions on the western plateau are caused by these excavations. The lowest layers form the [[Impressa]]-layers (low Malm alpha), which are approximately 25 m thick, and the [[Bimammatum]]-lime (high Malm alpha). The old name of the [[Planula]]-lime (Malm beta) is factory lime, which indicates the use as building material. This layer, which is 15 m thick and interspersed with sponge reefs, sets up the plateau of the ''Osterwiese''. The small [[quarry]] below of the main peak consists of Planula-lime in its lower part, and its upper part is showing the [[Ataxiocerate]]'s layer (Malm gamma), which builds up the main peak and is 20 m thick. The top layer of Malm gamma and the layers of Malm delta to Malm zeta are already ablated on the Hesselberg.

==History of colonization and important incidents in the Hesselberg region==
On some parking lots of the touristic region the responsible municipalities mounted illustrated charts, which provide an insight into the history of colonization.

===Pre- and early history===
The first settlers frequented the Hesselberg and used it as shelter and dwelling already in prehistorical ages. Archeological artefacts from the [[Stone Age]] (approx. 10,000 to 2000 [[B.C.]]) were found mainly on the ''Osterwiese''. In the [[Bronze Age]] (approx. 2000 to 1300 B.C.) constant settlement took place. In the [[Urnfield culture|Urnfield time]] (approx. 1200 to 750 B.C.) the colony at the plateaus was surrounded with [[curtain wall]]s, [[moat]]s, and walls. Even today the remains of the border walls, which were 5 km long, around the ''Osterwiese'', the ''Ehinger mountain'', and the ''Gerolfinger mountain'' provide an idea of the importance of these fortifications. Behind of the sheltering brickwork an important political, economic, and religious center evolved. For a long time these constructions were thought to be of [[Celt|celtic]] origin, but only one artefact (the weapons of a warrior) from the [[La Tène culture|La Tène period]] (500 to 15 B.C.) indicates a short visit of the Celts. In the restless [[Migration Period]] and during the [[Middle Ages]] people used the walls of Hesselberg as a shelter and for defensive purposes. In the city museum of [[Oettingen in Bayern|Oettingen]] and in the museum for pre- and early history in [[Gunzenhausen]] there are a lot of exhibits like tools and weapons.

===The Romans===
Under the rules of emperors [[Domitian]] (81 - 96 [[A.D.]]) and [[Hadrian]] (117 - 138 A.D.) the Romans pushed the border of their province [[Raetia]] farther to the North. They expanded the wall of [[Limes Germanicus|Limes]] in order to protect against the [[Germanic peoples]] and equipped it with a lot of watchtowers. In direct vicinity of the Hesselberg big [[Castellum|Castella]] were built. Under the rule of emperor [[Caracalla]] (around 213 A.D.) the last and widest extension of the Limes took place. To the west of the mountain the wall crossed the rivers [[Wörnitz]] and [[Sulzach]] in north-south direction. A few [[kilometer]]s to the north of [[Wittelshofen]] it turned eastward. Due to this sharp bend the strategically important Hesselberg was included in the [[Roman empire]]. There were Castella at [[Aufkirchen]], [[Ruffenhofen]], [[Dambach (Ehingen)|Dambach]], and [[Unterschwaningen]]. The [[Castellum Ruffenhofen]] was the biggest one in the Hesselberg area. [[Archeologist]]s could not prove Roman buildings on the mountain itself. Remains of the Limes can be found as stone ridges hidden in the woods. Nowadays most of the civil and military wall remains are hidden in the ground of meadows and fields. On top of the Castellum Ruffenhofen a Roman park is built. In the local museum of [[Weitlingen]] there are a few Roman exhibits.

===The Alamanni and Franks===
Around 260 A.D. [[Alamanni]]c and Germanic groups entered the region and destroyed the fortifications of the Limes, Castelli, and settlements. The Romans had to shift the border back to the [[Danube]]. The Alamanni founded their first [[grange]]s and farmed the land as farmers and ranchers. Besides town names ending with "''-ingen''" the '''Langstreifengewannflur''' indicates Alamannic foundation. The villages Röck''ingen'', Eh''ingen'', Gerolf''ingen'', Weilt''ingen'', and Irs''ingen'' have their seeds in that period. At the end of the 5<sup>th</sup> century the [[Franks]] emerged from the lower [[Main]] valley and initiated the second wave of colonization. In the years 496 to 506 and under the rule of [[Merovingian]] king [[Clovis I]]. they defeated the [[Swabia]]n Alamanni, which lost their northern territories that formerly reached into the Neuwieder basin, and which were pushed back behind the line [[Oos]]-[[Hornisgrinde]]-[[Asperg]]-Hesselberg; to date this line almost corresponds to the boundary of the Franconian and the Swabian/Alamannic dialect. In spite of the fact that the Franks overrode the Alamanni in a partly violent fashion, mixed settlements (e.g. Ehingen and Röckingen) — with almost always a Franconian mayor — developed in the Hesselberg region. Amongst others the Franks founded the villages Lenters''heim'', Obermögers''heim'', Geils''heim'', Franken''hofen'', and Königs''hofen''. The Franconian peasants established the '''Dreifelderwirtschaft''' with its '''Flurzwang''', which was practiced until the modern consolidation of farming. In the 7<sup>th</sup> century — under the rule of Merovingian king [[Dagobert I]]. — [[christianization]] started in [[Augsburg]]. In the 8<sup>th</sup> century [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[missionary|missionaries]] founded the monastery of [[Heidenheim (middle Franconia)|Heidenheim]] under Franconian [[Carolingian]] rule.

===Middle Ages===
In early [[Middle Ages]] the Hesselberg region was part of the king's forests. Sparse remains of castles are found on Ehinger mountain and on Schlössleinsbuck. The construction on Ehinger mountain has its seeds in the [[Carolingian]]-[[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] period (8<sup>th</sup>-9<sup>th</sup> century). Discovered tombs are pointing towards a violent end caused by Hungarian soldiers at the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century. The [[Hungary|Hungarians]] burnt down the whole castle. The building on Schlössleinsbuck was intended for use as a refuge. In the 11<sup>th</sup> or 12<sup>th</sup> century it was expanded by the [[lord]]s of Lentersheim and adapted as a well-fortified [[knight]]'s castle. One can read about the castle's destruction in the [[family tree]] of the lords of Lentersheim: ''When Conrad of Lentersheim returned from the northern Italian campaigns of king Frederick II. in 1246, his castle was completely destroyed. Thereupon he began building a new castle in Neuenmuhr.'' In fact, soldiers from the Hesselberg region accompanied the mentioned [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] king [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]. to Italy in 1239 in order to fight against [[pope Gregory IX]]. Until they died off at the beginning 19<sup>th</sup> century, the lords of Lentersheim lived at their castles in Alten- and Neuenmuhr, today's [[Muhr am See]].

Afterwards direct colonization of the Hesselberg ended. [[Aufkirchen]], which was fortified during medieval times, has a [[city wall]] and four [city gate]]s. At that time Aufkirchen had [[town privileges]].
