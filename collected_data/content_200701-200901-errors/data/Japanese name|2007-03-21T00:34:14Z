[[Image:Yamada-vertical.svg|thumbnail|100px|right|[[Yamada]] [[Taro (disambiguation)|Tarō]] ({{lang|ja|山田太郎}}), a typical Japanese name (male), equivalent to ''John Smith'' in English. ''Jane Smith'' would be Yamada Hanako ({{lang|ja|山田花子}}).]]
{{nihongo|'''Japanese names'''|人名|jinmei}} in modern times usually consist of a [[family name]] (surname), followed by a [[given name]]. This is common to [[East Asia]], including among the [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Korean people|Korean]], [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], and sometimes [[Thai people|Thai]] cultures. [[Middle name]]s are not recognized in [[Japan]] in the [[Western world|Western]] sense, in which there is a clear differentiation from the given name. Japanese names are usually written in [[kanji]] (Han characters). The ''kanji'' for a name may have a variety of possible pronunciations.

Common family names in [[Japan]] include [[Sato|Satō]] ({{lang|ja|佐藤}}) (most common), [[Suzuki (disambiguation)|Suzuki]] ({{lang|ja|鈴木}}) (second most common), [[Takahashi]] ({{lang|ja|高橋}}) (third most common), and [[Kato|Katō]] ({{lang|ja|加藤}}) (tenth most common).<ref>[http://www.japanese-name-translation.com/site/top500_Japanese_family_names.xls] ([[.XLS file]]).
</ref> According to estimates, there are as many as 100,000 different surnames in use today in Japan. Surnames occur with varying frequency in different regions; for example, the names Chinen ({{lang|ja|知念}}), Higa ({{lang|ja|比嘉}}), and Shimabukuro ({{lang|ja|島袋}}) are common in [[Okinawa]] but not in other parts of Japan. Many Japanese family names derive from features of the rural landscape; for example, [[Ishikawa]] ({{lang|ja|石川}}) means "stone river," [[Yamamoto]] (山本) means "the base of the mountain," and [[Inoue]] ({{lang|ja|井上}}) means "above the well."

Given names are much more diverse in [[pronunciation]] and character usage. Male names often end in ''-rō'' ({{lang|ja|郎}} "son", but also {{lang|ja|朗}} "clear, bright") or ''-ta'' ({{lang|ja|太}} "great, thick"), or contain ''ichi'' ({{lang|ja|一}} "first [son]"), ''kazu'' (also written with 一 "first [son]", along with several other possible characters), ''ji'' ({{lang|ja|二}} "second [son]" or {{lang|ja|次}} "next"), or ''dai'' ({{lang|ja|大}} "great, large") while female names often end in ''-ko'' ({{lang|ja|子}} "child") or ''-mi'' ({{lang|ja|美}} "beauty"). (Since 1980, the popularity of female names ending in ''-ko'' has dramatically fallen for new baby names and some women drop the ''-ko'' upon adulthood.) Other popular endings for female names include ''-ka'' ({{lang|ja|香}} "scent, perfume" or {{lang|ja|花}} / {{lang|ja|華}} "flower") and ''-na'' ({{lang|ja|奈}}, or {{lang|ja|菜}}, meaning greens).

==Structure==
All [[Japanese people]] have one surname and one given name with no middle name, except for the [[Imperial House of Japan|Japanese imperial family]], whose members bear no surname. The given name in Japanese is called the "name" ({{lang|ja|名前}} ''namae'') or "lower name" ({{lang|ja|下の名前}} ''shita no namae''). The surname is called ''myōji'' ({{lang|ja|苗字}} or {{lang|ja|名字}}), "uji" ({{lang|ja|氏}}) or ''sei'' ({{lang|ja|姓}}).  In Japanese, the family name precedes the given name.

Historically, ''myōji'', ''uji'' and ''sei'' had different meanings. ''Sei'' was originally the [[matrilineal]] surname.  Later it became granted only by the emperor.  There were relatively few ''sei'', and most of the medieval noble clans trace their lineage either directly to these ''sei'' or to the courtiers of these ''sei''.  ''Uji'' was first used to designate [[patrilineal]] descent, but later merged with ''myōji'' around the same time ''sei'' lost its matrilineal significance.  ''Myōji'' was, simply, what a family chooses to call itself, as opposed to the ''sei'' granted by the emperor.  While it was passed on patrilineally, one had a certain degree of freedom in changing one's ''myōji''.

There are a few names that can be used as either surnames or given names. (For example Kaneko {{lang|ja|金子}}, or Masuko {{lang|ja|益子}}). In addition, to those familiar with Japanese names, which name is the surname and which is the given name is usually apparent, no matter which order the names are presented in. This thus makes it unlikely that the two names will be confused, for example when writing in English using the order family name, given name.

==Characters==
Japanese names are usually written in [[kanji]] (Chinese characters), although some names use [[hiragana]] or even [[katakana]], or a mixture of kanji and [[kana]]. While most "traditional" names use [[kunyomi|kun'yomi]] (native Japanese) kanji readings, a large number of given names and surnames use [[onyomi|on'yomi]] (Chinese-based) kanji readings as well.  Many others use readings which are only used in names ([[nanori]]), such as the female name Nozomi ({{lang|ja|希}}). The majority of surnames comprise one, two or three kanji characters. There are also a small number of four-kanji surnames, such as Mukainakano ({{lang|ja|向井中野}}) (Meaning 'approaching the centre of community life'), but these are extremely rare.

As mentioned above, female given names often end in the syllable ''ko'', written with the kanji meaning "child" ({{lang|ja|子}}). This was much more common up to about the 1980s, but the practice does continue today.  Male names occasionally end with the syllable ''ko'', but very rarely using the kanji {{lang|ja|子}} (most often, if a male name ends in ''ko'', it ends in ''hiko'', using the kanji {{lang|ja|彦}}).  Common male name endings are -''shi'' and -''o''; names ending with -''shi'' are often verbs, e.g., ''Atsushi'' which might mean, for example, "to be faithful." In the past (before [[World War II]]), names written with katakana were common for women, but this trend seems to have lost favour. Hiragana names for women are not unusual. Kana names for boys, particularly those written in hiragana, have historically been very rare.  This may be in part because the hiragana script is seen as feminine; in medieval Japan, women generally were not taught kanji and wrote exclusively in hiragana.

Names, like other Japanese words, cannot begin with the syllable ''n'' ({{lang|ja|ん}}, {{lang|ja|ン}}). Some names end in ''n'': the male names Ken, Kon, Shin, Jun, and Den are examples.  The syllable ''n'' should not be confused with the sound "n," which names ''can'' begin with (provided the "n" sound is paired with a vowel); for example, the female name Naoko ({{lang|ja|尚子}}) or the male Naoya ({{lang|ja|直哉}}). 

One large category of family names can be categorized as "''-tō''" names. The kanji {{lang|ja|藤}}, meaning ''[[wisteria]]'', has the on'yomi ''tō'' (or, with [[rendaku]], ''dō''). Many Japanese people have surnames that include this kanji as the second character. This is because the [[Fujiwara clan]]（{{lang|ja|藤原家}}）gave their [[samurai]] surnames ending with the first character of their name, to denote their status in an era when commoners were not allowed surnames.  Examples include [[Ato|Atō]], [[Ando|Andō]], [[Itō]] (although a different final kanji is also common), [[Udo|Udō]], [[Eto|Etō]], [[Endo|Endō]], [[Goto|Gotō]], [[Jitō]], [[Kato|Katō]], [[Kito|Kitō]], [[Kudo|Kudō]], [[Kondo|Kondō]], [[Saito|Saitō]], [[Sato|Satō]], [[Shindo|Shindō]], [[Sudo|Sudō]], [[Naito|Naitō]], [[Bito|Bitō]], and [[Muto|Mutō]]. As already noted, some of the most common family names are in this list.

===Difficulty of reading names===
A name written in kanji may have more than one common pronunciation, only one of which is correct for a given individual. For example, the surname written in kanji as {{lang|ja|梅田}} may be read either ''Umeda'' or ''Umeta''. Conversely, any one name may have several possible written forms, and again, only one will be correct for a given individual. The character 一 when used as a male given name may be used as the written form for "Hajime," "Ichi," "Kazu," "Hitoshi," and many others. The name "Hajime"  may be written with any of the following: {{lang|ja|始}}, {{lang|ja|治}}, {{lang|ja|初}}, {{lang|ja|一}}, {{lang|ja|元}}, {{lang|ja|肇}}, {{lang|ja|創}}, {{lang|ja|甫}}, {{lang|ja|基}}, {{lang|ja|哉}}, {{lang|ja|啓}}, {{lang|ja|春}}, {{lang|ja|本}}, {{lang|ja|源}}, {{lang|ja|東}}, {{lang|ja|大}}, {{lang|ja|孟}}, or {{lang|ja|祝}}. This many-to-many correspondence between names and the ways they are written is much more common with male given names than with surnames or female given names, but can be observed in all these categories. This can make the [[collation]], [[pronunciation]], and [[romanization]] of a Japanese name a very difficult problem. For this reason, business cards often include the pronunciation of the name as [[furigana]], and forms and documents always have spaces to write the reading of the name in kana (usually katakana). At restaurants in Japan it is common to wait to be seated by writing one's name on a list and waiting to be called, and at the top of the list there is usually a request to write one's name in katakana, rather than kanji.

A few Japanese names, particularly family names, include old-fashioned versions of characters. For example the very common character ''shima'', island, may be written as {{lang|ja|嶋}} or {{lang|ja|嶌}} instead of the usual {{lang|ja|島}}. Some names also feature very uncommon [[kanji]], or even kanji which no longer exist in modern Japanese.  Japanese people who have such names are likely to compromise by substituting similar or simplified  characters.

An example of such a name is [[Saito|Saitō]].  While there are over 100 kanji that can be read as ''sai'' and over 200 kanji for ''tō'', in this case, there are two common kanji for ''sai''.  The two ''sai'' characters have different meanings: {{lang|ja|斉}} means "together" or "parallel", but {{lang|ja|斎}} means "to purify". Confusing the two characters would be an embarrassing mistake.

Family names are sometimes written with idiosyncratic characters, called [[ateji]], that relate indirectly to the name as spoken. For example, {{lang|ja|四月一日}} would normally be read as ''shigatsu tsuitachi'' ("April 1st"), but as a family name it is read ''watanuki'' ("unpadded clothes"), because April 1st is the traditional date to switch from winter to summer clothes.

Most Japanese people and agencies have adopted customs to deal with these issues.  [[Address book]]s, for instance, often contain [[furigana]] or [[ruby characters]] to clarify the pronunciation of the name.  Japanese nationals are also required to give a [[romanized name]] for their [[passport]]. The recent use of Japanese media using katakana when referring to Japanese celebrities who have gained international fame has started a fad among young [[socialite]]s attempting to invoke a cosmopolitan flair who use katakana names as a badge of honor. All of these complications are also found in [[Japanese place name]]s.

Not all names are complicated. Some common names are summarized by the phrase ''tanakamura'' ("the village in the midst of the fields"): the three kanjis: {{lang|ja|田}} (''ta'', rice field), {{lang|ja|中}} (''naka'', middle) and {{lang|ja|村}} (''mura'', village), together in any pair, form a simple, reasonably common surname: [[Tanaka]], [[Nakamura]], [[Murata]], [[Nakata]], [[Muranaka]], [[Tamura]].

Despite these difficulties, there are enough patterns and recurring names that most native Japanese will be able to read virtually all family names they encounter and the majority of personal names.

=== Regulations ===
Kanji names in Japan are governed by the government's rules on kanji use.  There are currently ([[As of 2004|as of Oct 2004]]) 2,232 "name kanji" (the [[jinmeiyo kanji|jinmeiyō kanji]]) used in personal names, and the government plans to increase this list by 578 kanji in the near future. This would be the largest increase since [[World War II]].  Only kanji which appear on the official list may be used in given names.  This is to ensure that names can be written and read by those literate in Japanese.  Rules also govern names considered to be inappropriate; for example, in [[1993]] two parents who tried to name their child Akuma, which literally means the devil, were prohibited from doing so. <ref>[http://www.nistep.go.jp/achiev/ftx/eng/pol001e/html/pol001ee.html]</ref>

Though there are regulations on the naming of children many old characters can still be found in adults' names.  Because these restrictions have been confusing to say the least, many recent changes have been made to increase rather than to decrease the number of kanji allowed for use in names.  Moreover, the Sapporo High Court held that it was unlawful for the government to deny registration of a child's name because it contained a kanji character that was relatively common but not included in the official list of name characters compiled by the Ministry of Justice.  Subsequently, the Japanese government promulgated plans to increase the number of "permitted" kanji.  

The use of a space in given names (to separate first and middle names) is not allowed, because technically, a space is not an allowed character.

The plan to increase the number of name kanji has been controversial, largely because Chinese characters meaning "cancer", "hemorrhoids", "corpse", and "excrement", as well as those used in [[jukugo]] (words which are compounds of two or more kanji) meaning "curse", "prostitute", and "rape", are among the proposed additions to the list. This is because no measures were taken to determine the appropriateness of the kanji proposed. The government will seek input from the public before approving the list.

== Customs ==
In ancient times, people in Japan were considered the property of the Emperor and their surname reflected the role in the government they served. An example is [[Ōtomo clan|Ōtomo]] (おおとも 'great attendant, companion'). Names would also be given in the recognition of a great achievement and contribution. Some surnames originated from [[Chinese name|Chinese]] and [[Korean name]]s. Examples are Kaneshiro ({{lang|ja|金城}}) (Chinese) and [[O (name)|Ō]] ({{lang|ja|王}}) (Chinese).

Until the [[Meiji restoration]], Japanese common people (people other than [[kuge]] and [[samurai]]) had no surnames, and when necessary, used a substitute such as the name of their birthplace. For example, Ichirō born in Asahi mura (Asahi village) in the province of [[Musashi Province|Musashi]] would say "Ichirō from Asahi-mura of Musashi".  Merchants were named after their brands (for example, Denbei, the owner of Sagamiya, would be Sagamiya Denbei), and farmers were named after their fathers (for example, Fujida, whose father was Doiji, would be "Fujida son of Doiji").  After the Meiji restoration, the government ordered all commoners to assume surnames in addition to their given names: many people adopted historical names, while others simply made names up or had a local sage make up a surname.  This explains, in part, the large number of surnames in Japan, as well as their great diversity of spellings and pronunciations.

During the period when typical parents had several children, it was a common practice to name sons by numbers suffixed with ''rō'' ({{lang|ja|郎}}, "son").  The first son would be known as "Ichirō", the second as "Jirō", and so on. Girls were often named with ''ko'' ({{lang|ja|子}}, "child") at the end of the given name; this should not be confused with the less common male suffix ''hiko'' ({{lang|ja|彦}}). Both practices have become less common, although many children still have names along these lines. 

===Speaking to and of others===
{{main|Japanese titles}}

The way in which a name is used in conversation depends on the circumstances and the speaker's relationships with the listener and the bearer of the name.  Typically the family name is used, with given names largely restricted to informal situations and cases where the speaker is older than, superior to, or very familiar with the named individual.  When addressing someone, or referring to a member of one's [[Uchi-soto|out-group]], a title such as {{lang|ja|さん}} ''-san'' is typically added.

Japanese people avoid often referring to their seniors or superiors by name at all, using just a title: within a family this might be a kinship relation such as ''okāsan'' ("mother"), in a school it could be {{lang|ja|先生}} ''sensei'' ("teacher"), while a company president would be addressed as {{lang|ja|社長}} ''shachō''.

===Nicknames===
{{main|Japanese abbreviated and contracted words}}
The common Japanese practice of forming abbreviations by concatenating the first two [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]] of two words  is sometimes applied to names (usually those of celebrities). For example, {{nihongo|[[Takuya Kimura]]|木村 拓哉|Kimura Takuya}}, a famous Japanese actor and singer, becomes {{nihongo|''Kimutaku''|キムタク|}}. This is sometimes applied even to non-Japanese celebrities: [[Brad Pitt]], whose full name in Japanese is {{nihongo|Buraddo Pitto|ブラッド ピット|}} is commonly known as {{nihongo|''Burapi''|ブラピ|}}, [[Jimi Hendrix]], who abbreviated as {{nihongo|''Jimihen''|ジミヘン|}}. Some [[tarento|Japanese celebrities]] have also taken names combining kanji and katakana, such as [[Takeshi Kitano|Beat Takeshi]] (Takeshi Kitano), [[Masashi Tashiro|Marcy]] (Masashi Tashiro), [[Masayuki Suzuki (singer)|Martin]] (Masayuki Suzuki).

Corresponding to any given name there are one or more [[hypocoristic]]s, affectionate nicknames. These are formed by adding the suffix -chan ちゃん to a stem. There are two types of stem. One consists of the full given name. Examples of this type are ''Tarō-chan'' from ''Tarō'', ''Kimikochan'' from ''Kimiko'', and ''Yasunarichan'' from ''Yasunari''. The other type of stem is a modified stem derived from the full given name. Examples of such names are: ''Taro-chan'' from ''Tarō'', ''Kiichan'' from ''Kimiko'', and ''Yā-chan'' from ''Yasunari''. Hypochoristics with modified stems are more intimate than those based on the full given name.

Hypochoristics with modified stems are derived by adding -chan to a stem consisting of an integral number, usually one but occasionally two, of [[Foot (prosody)|feet]], where a foot consists of two [[mora]]s. A mora {{lang|ja|音節}} is the unit of which a light syllable contains one and a heavy syllable two. For example, the stems that may be derived from ''Tarō'' are /taro/, consisting of two light syllables, and /taa/, consisting of a single syllable with a long vowel, resulting in ''Taro-chan'' and ''Tā-chan''. The stems that may be derived from ''Hanako'' are /hana/, with two light syllables, /han/, with one syllable closed by a consonant, and /haa/, with one syllable with a long vowel, resulting in ''Hanachan'', ''Hanchan'', and ''Hāchan''. The segmental content is usually a left substring of that of the given name. However, in some cases it is obtained by other means, including the use of another reading of the Chinese characters used to write the name. For example, a girl named ''Keiko'' may be called ''Meguchan'' because the character used to write the /kei/ of ''Keiko'', {{lang|ja|恵}}, can also be read /megu/.

In general, one may use a hypochoristic only if he or she has known the person since he or she was a child. Thus, they may be used for children or for adults whom one has known since they were children.

== Names from other ethnic groups in Japan ==
Many ethnic minorities, mostly Korean and Chinese, living in Japan adopt Japanese names. The roots of this custom go back to the colonial-era policy of [[sōshi-kaimei]], which in theory permitted and in practise compelled many Koreans to change their names to Japanese names. Nowadays, ethnic minorities take on Japanese names, sometimes called ''pass names'', to ease communication and, more importantly, to avoid [[discrimination]]. A few of them still keep their native names. One Korean who keeps his original name is [[Chang Woo Han]], a founder and chairman of [[Maruhan]] Corp., a large chain of [[pachinko]] parlors in Japan.

Japanese citizenship requires adopting a Japanese name. In recent decades, the government has allowed individuals to simply adopt katakana versions of their native names when applying for citizenship: Parliament member "[[Marutei Tsurunen|Tsurunen Marutei]]" ({{lang|ja|ツルネン マルテイ}}), originally Martti Turunen, is a famous example.  Others transliterate their names into phonetically similar kanji compounds, such as immigrant's-rights activist [[Arudou Debito|David Aldwinckle]], who became "Arudou Debito" ({{lang|ja|有道出人}}). Still others have abandoned their native names entirely in favor of traditional Japanese names, such as [[Lafcadio Hearn]], who used the name "Koizumi Yakumo" ({{lang|ja|小泉 八雲}}). At the time, to gain Japanese citizenship, it was necessary to be adopted by a Japanese family (in Hearn's case, it was his wife's family) and take their name.

Ethnic Chinese and Koreans in Japan sometimes have to change the characters in their names to apply for citizenship, because of the restrictions on which kanji can be used.

Individuals born overseas with Western given names and Japanese surnames are usually given a katakana name in Western order when referred to in Japanese.  [[Eric Shinseki]], for instance, is referred to as {{lang|ja|エリック シンセキ}} (Erikku Shinseki).

There is a restriction ([[as of 2001]]) on the use of the "v" character in a name unless at least one of the parent is of foreign origin. The closest corresponding katakana is {{lang|ja|ヴ}}, which can be romanized as v or b. This affects issuing of Japanese [[passport]]s or other documentation where a romaji representation of the name is given; the letter v is replaced with b.  This affects names such as Kevin ({{lang|ja|ケヴィン}}), which would be written as Kebin.

== Imperial names ==

[[Image:Akishinodera1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Akishino-dera in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], from which [[Prince Akishino]] took his name]]
{{seealso|Imperial Household of Japan}}
The [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese emperor]] and his families have no surname for historical reasons, only a given name such as [[Hirohito]] ({{lang|ja|裕仁}}), which is rarely used in Japan: Japanese prefer to say "the Emperor" or "the Crown Prince", out of respect and as a measure of politeness.

When children are born into the Imperial family, they are given a standard given name, as well as a special title. Akihito, for instance, was born as Tsugu-no-miya Akihito, and was referred to as "Prince Tsugu" during his childhood. This title is generally used until the individual becomes heir to the throne or inherits one of the historical princely family names ({{lang|ja|常陸宮}} ''Hitachi-no-miya'', {{lang|ja|三笠宮}} ''Mikasa-no-miya'', {{lang|ja|秋篠宮}} ''Akishino-no-miya'', etc.).

Many members of the extended Imperial family became commoners after [[World War II]], and adopted their Imperial surnames as regular surnames.  An example is [[Asaka Yasuhiko]].

== Historical names ==

The current structure (''family name'' + ''given name'') did not materialize until the [[1870s]] when the government made the new family registration system.

In feudal Japan, names reflected a person's social status. They also reflect a person's affiliation to Buddhist, Shintō, feudatory-military, Confucian-scholarly, mercantile, peasant, slave and imperial orders.

Before feudal times, [[Japanese clan]] names figured prominently in history: names with ''no'' fall into this category. (''No'' means ''of'', although the association is in the opposite order in Japanese, and is not generally explicitly written in this style of name.) Thus, [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] ({{lang|ja|源 頼朝}}) was Yoritomo ({{lang|ja|頼朝}}) of the [[Minamoto]] ({{lang|ja|源}}) clan. [[Fujiwara no Kamatari]], [[Ki no Tsurayuki]] ({{lang|ja|紀 貫之}}), and [[Taira no Kiyomori]] ({{lang|ja|平 清盛}}) are additional examples.

Historically, a Japanese person could maintain several names to use in different occasions. Among those that were common are ''Azana'', ''Imina'' or ''Okurina'' (either translate to [[posthumous name]]) and ''Gō'' (号) or ''Kagō'' (加号) (a pen name). It was not uncommon for one to have more than 10 names. [http://www21.big.or.jp/~kirin/otya2.html] Imina is the same as one's [[real name]] and the real name would be called ''Imina'' posthumously. It is called so because after one's death, he would be referred by his ''Okurina'' while the pronunciation of ''Imina'' is being avoided. ''Azana'', which is given at [[Genpuku]] ({{lang|ja|元服}}), is used by others and one himself uses his real name to refer to him. ''Kagō'' (加号) is commonly named after places or houses.

In the [[late shogunate period]], many anti-government activists used several false names to hide their activities from the [[shogunate]]. Examples are Saitani Umetarō ({{lang|ja|才谷梅太郎}}) for [[Sakamoto Ryoma|Sakamoto Ryōma]] ({{lang|ja|坂本 龍馬}}), Niibori Matsusuke ({{lang|ja|新堀松輔}}) for [[Kido Takayoshi]] ({{lang|ja|木戸 孝允}}) and Tani Umenosuke ({{lang|ja|谷梅之助}}) for [[Takasugi Shinsaku]] ({{lang|ja|高杉 晋作}}). The famous writer [[Kyokutei Bakin]] ({{lang|ja|曲亭 馬琴}}) is known to have had as many as 33 names.

== Professional names ==

[[Actor]]s and [[actor|actress]]es in [[Western culture|Western]] and Japanese [[drama]]tic forms, [[comedians]], [[sumo]] wrestlers, and practitioners of traditional [[craft]]s often use professional names. [[Kabuki]] actors take one of the traditional surnames such as Nakamura ({{lang|ja|中村}}), Bandō or Onoe. Many stage names of [[television]] and [[film]] actors and actresses are unremarkable, being just like ordinary Japanese personal names, but a few are tongue-in-cheek. For example, [[Kamatari Fujiwara]] ({{lang|ja|藤原 鎌足}}) chose the name of the aforementioned founder of the [[Fujiwara family]], while [[Hino Yojin|Hino Yōjin]] ({{lang|ja|日野陽仁}})'s name sounds like ''be careful with fire'' (although written differently). Many stand-up comics like the duo [[Beat Takeshi]] and [[Beat Kiyoshi]] choose a Western name for the act, and use their own (or stage) given names.  Writers also tend to be clever about their names, for example [[Edogawa Ranpo]] which is designed to sound like "[[Edgar Allan Poe]]".

[[Sumo]] wrestlers take wrestling names called ''[[shikona]]'' ({{lang|ja|醜名}} or {{lang|ja|四股名}}). While a shikona can be the wrestler's own surname, most upper-division rikishi have a shikona  different from their surname. A typical shikona consists of one, two or three kanji. Often, part of the name comes from the wrestler's master, a place name (such as the name of a [[Provinces of Japan|province]], a [[river]], or a [[sea]]), the name of a weapon, an item identified with Japanese tradition (like a [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] or [[brocade|nishiki]]), or a term indicating superiority. Often, ''waka'' indicates a wrestler whose father was also in sumo; in this case, the meaning is ''junior''. Wrestlers can change their shikona, as Takahanada did when he became Takanohana ({{lang|ja|貴ノ花}}) and then [[Takanohana Koji|Takanohana]] ({{lang|ja|貴乃花}}).  Another notable example is the wrestler [[Sentoryu]], which means ''fighting war dragon'' but is also homophonous with [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], his city of origin.

[[Geisha]] and practitioners of traditional crafts and arts such as [[pottery]], the [[tea ceremony]], [[calligraphy]], [[irezumi]] (tattooing) and [[ikebana]] (flower arranging) often take professional names. In many cases, these come from the master under whom they studied.

== Japanese names in English ==

As is the case for other transliterations, writing Japanese names in English poses several issues, mainly [[romanization]] and [[name order]] issues.

As this differs from the ordering used in many other parts of the world, some, particularly academics, adopt the convention of writing the family name in upper case when the name is romanized: for example, Takuya MURATA or MURATA Takuya.  Artists whose works are distributed in English outside of Japan often opt for a Western ordering on the English editions of their works: e.g., [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] ({{lang|ja|坂本 龍一}} ''Sakamoto Ryūichi''), [[Shunji Iwai]] ({{lang|ja|岩井 俊二}} ''Iwai Shunji''),  and [[Haruki Murakami]] ({{lang|ja|村上 春樹}} ''Murakami Haruki'').  Japanese living overseas, such as [[Yoko Ono]] ({{lang|ja|小野 洋子}} ''Ono Yōko'') and [[Ichiro Suzuki]] ({{lang|ja|鈴木 一朗}} ''Suzuki Ichirō''), usually use the Western order as well.
[[Image:SugorokuMutou.PNG|thumb|Manga translated into English and other Indo-European languages often use the Western naming order for Japanese characters. The character "[[Sugoroku Mutou]]" of ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' would have his name read ''Mutō Sugoroku'' in Japanese order. The character is known as "Solomon Muto" in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (second series anime)|English-language TV series]].]]
Most foreign scholars of Japanese history and literature use the Japanese order, so historical and literary figures are usually referred to in that order: e.g., [[Murasaki Shikibu]] ({{lang|ja|紫 式部}}) and [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] ({{lang|ja|徳川 家康}}).  However, English publications tend to prefer the Western order when discussing contemporary individuals, especially [[politician]]s, [[businessman|businessmen]] and [[athlete]]s. In contrast, when written in kanji characters, the order of Japanese names is never reversed.

The following English publications tend to use the western order to refer to Japanese figures:
* [[Newspaper]]s: see [[List of newspapers in Japan]]
* Credits in movies
* Characters in [[comics]] (if the names of the characters have not been completely changed)
* Books concerning contemporary Japanese culture like [[J-pop]]

The following tend to keep the original Japanese order:
* Scholastic articles
* Books concerning historical Japanese activities like [[Go (board game)|Go]] and [[Waka (poetry)|Waka]]

Characters in translated Japanese [[manga]], [[anime]] and [[video game]]s are special cases. They are sometimes given new Western names (as in ''[[Pokémon]]'' for example), or they may keep their original Japanese names in either Japanese or Western name order. They may also have non-[[Hepburn romanization|Hepburn]] transliterations of their names, or even different transliterations between different editions or between manga, anime and/or video game versions (as in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'', for example).
