'''Romanian''' (''limba română'', {{IPA2|'limba ro'mɨnə}}) is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] spoken by around 24 to 26 million people, primarily in [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]]. It enjoys official status in [[Romania]], [[Moldova]] and the Autonomous Province of [[Vojvodina]] ([[Serbia]]). The official form of the [[Moldovan language]] <ref name=Moldova/> in the [[Republic of Moldova]] is identical to the official form of Romanian save for a minor rule in [[orthography|spelling]]. Romanian is also an official or administrative language in various communities and organisations (such as the [[Latin Union]] and the [[European Union]]).

Romanian speakers are also found abroad in many other countries (due to emigration), notably in [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[France]] and [[Germany]] (cf. [[Romanians]]). Owing to a general lack of consistently-derived data, precise estimates for the total numbers of Romanian-speaking emigrants are not available. Some secondary sources claim for example that more than 3 million Romanian speakers live abroad as immigrants in [[Europe]] and [[North America]]<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20041025024030/http://www.expres.ro/topstory/?news_id=154270http://web.archive.org/web/20041025024030/http://www.expres.ro/topstory/?news_id=154270 "Milioane de români pe drumul emigrarii"] ("Millions of Romanians on the road of emigration"). ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', [[May 10]], 2004. Page is on [[Internet Archive]], retrieved Oct 25, 2004.</ref>; however, such census data as is available indicates that these numbers may be widely inaccurate.

== History ==
The Romanian territory was inhabited in ancient times by the [[Dacia]]ns, an Indo-European people. They were defeated by the [[Roman Empire]] in [[106]] and part of Dacia ([[Oltenia]], [[Banat]] and [[Transylvania]]) became a Roman province. For the next 165 years, there is evidence of considerable Roman colonization in the area, the region being in close communication with the rest of the Roman empire. [[Vulgar Latin]] became the language of the administration and commerce.

Under the pressure of the [[Free Dacians]] and of the [[Goths]], the Roman administration and legions were withdrawn from Dacia between [[271]]-[[275]]. Whether the Romanians are the descendants of these people that abandoned the area and settled south of the Danube or of the people that remained in Dacia is a matter of debate. ''For further discussion, see [[Origin of Romanians]]''.
[[Image:Romance languages and Romanian.png|thumb|440px|The place of Romanian within the Romance language family]]
Due to its geographical isolation, Romanian was probably the first language that split and until the modern age was not influenced by other Romance languages, which can explain why it is one of the most uniform languages in Europe. It is more conservative than other Romance languages in [[Romanian nouns|nominal]] morphology. Romanian has preserved [[declension]], but whereas Latin had six cases, Romanian has three, the [[nominative]]/[[accusative]], the [[genitive]]/[[dative]], and the [[vocative]], and retains the neuter [[Grammatical gender|gender]] as well. However, the [[verb]]al morphology of Romanian has shown the same move towards a compound [[perfect tense|perfect]] and [[future tense]] as the other Romance languages.

[[Image:Map-balkans-vlachs.png|frame|Map of Balkans with regions inhabited by Romanians/Vlachs highlighted]]

All the dialects of Romanian are believed to have been unified in a [[Common Romanian]] language until sometime between the [[7th century|7th]] and the [[10th century]] when the area was influenced by the [[Byzantine Empire]] and Romanian became influenced by the [[Slavonic languages]]. [[Aromanian language]] has very few Slavonic words. Also, the variations in the [[Daco-Romanian]] dialect (spoken throughout Romania and Moldova) are very small. The use of this uniform Daco-Romanian dialect extends well beyond the borders of the Romanian state: a Romanian-speaker from Moldova speaks the same language as a Romanian-speaker from the Serbian [[Banat]], indicating a relatively recent migration to the northern territories.

Romanian developed in isolation with regard to the other Romance languages. Therefore, it was influenced by Slavonic (due to migration/assimilation, and feudal/ecclesiastical relations), Greek (Byzantine, then [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]]), Turkish, and Hungarian, while the other Romance languages adopted words and features of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]].

== Classification ==
Romanian is a [[Romance language]], belonging to the [[Italic languages|Italic branch]] of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]], having much in common with languages such as [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

However, the languages closest to Romanian are the other [[Eastern Romance languages]], spoken south of Danube: [[Aromanian language|Aromanian/Macedo-Romanian]], [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]] and [[Istro-Romanian language|Istro-Romanian]], which are sometimes classified as dialects of Romanian. An alternative name for Romanian used by linguists to disambiguate with the other Eastern Romance languages is "Daco-Romanian", referring to the area where it is spoken (which corresponds roughly to the onetime [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Dacia]]).

The Romanian variety spoken in Moldova has been named the [[Moldovan language]] by the Soviet and later Moldovan authorities, but linguists do not recognize it as a different language.

Out of the main Romance languages, Romanian is closest to [[Italian language|Italian]], the two show limited degree of asymmetrical [[mutual intelligibility]], especially in their cultivated forms: speakers of Romanian seem to understand Italian more easily than the other way around. Even though Romanian has obvious lexical and grammatical similarities with [[French language|French]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], it is not mutually intelligible with them to a practical extent; Romanian speakers will usually need some formal study of basic grammar and vocabulary before being able to understand even the simplest sentences in those languages (and vice-versa).

In the following sample sentence (meaning "She always closes the window before having dinner.") [[cognate]]s are written in bold:
<!-- in bold are words that derive from the same Latin word; words are bolded together with their articles: e.g. fereastră=finestra but fereastra=la finestra -->

:'''''Ea închide''''' întotdeauna '''''fereastra înainte de a cina.''''' (Romanian)
:'''''Ea''' semper '''fenestram claudit antequam cenet.''''' (Latin)
: '''''Ella''''' (or ''lei'') '''''chiude''' sempre '''la finestra''' prima '''di cenare'''.'' (Italian)
: '''''Elle''' ferme toujours '''la fenêtre avant de''' dîner.'' (French)
:'''''Ella''' siempre cierra la ventana '''antes de cenar'''.'' (Spanish)
:'''''Ela''' fecha sempre a janela '''antes de jantar'''.'' (Portuguese)
:'''''Ella''' tanca sempre '''la finestra''' '''abans de''' sopar.'' (Catalan)

On the other hand, Romanian vocabulary has been strongly influenced by French and Italian in the Modern Age (see [[#French, Italian and other international words]]). At present, the [[lexical similarity]] with Italian is estimated at 77%, whereas French follows at 75%, Sardinian 74%, Catalan 73%, Spanish at 71%, Portuguese and Rheto-Romance at 72%.

Romanian is spoken mostly in [[Romania]], [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]], [[Hungary]], [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]], but there are also Romanian language speakers in countries like [[Canada]], [[United States]], [[Germany]], [[Israel]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], mainly due to post-[[World War II]] emigration. A further surge in emigration to the Western countries occurred following the collapse of the [[Communist Bloc]] in 1989, as well as to other Latin countries such as [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[France]], and [[Portugal]].

===Legal status in Romania===
According to the [[Constitution of Romania]] of 1991, as revised in 2003, Romanian is the official language of the Republic.<ref>[http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_1&par1=1 Constitution of Romania]</ref>

[[Romania]] mandates the use of Romanian in official government publications, public [[education]] and legal [[contract]]s; [[advertisement]]s must bear a translation of foreign words.

[[Romanian Language Institute|Institutul Limbii Române]], established by the Ministry of Education of Romania, promotes the knowledge of the Romanian language and supports people willing to learn this language, working together with the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs|MFA]]'s Department for Romanians Abroad.<ref>[http://www.edu.ro/index.php/articles/c262/ Ministry of Education of Romania]</ref>

There exist in addition to Romanian a variety of officially-recognised minority languages spoken in Romania; see [[Languages of Romania]].

===Legal status in Moldova===
{{main|Moldovan language}}

About 10% of the world's Roumanophones are Moldovan, and Romanian is the single official language of [[Moldova]]. In the Constitution, the language is officially named [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]], although most linguists consider it virtually the same as the Romanian language. Also, the language used in [[school]]s, [[Mass media|media]], [[science|scientific]] environment and in the colloquial speech and writing is called Romanian.

Romanian has been the only official language of [[Moldova]] since the endorsement of the law on language of the [[Moldavian SSR]]. This law, still in force today, mandates the use of Moldovan in all the political, economical, cultural and social spheres, as it also does assert the real existence of "linguistic [[Moldovan language|Moldo]]-Romanian identity". <ref>[http://www.iatp.md/ladom/downloads/M3.doc Legea cu privire la functionarea limbilor vorbite pe teritoriul RSS Moldovenesti Nr.3465-XI din 01.09.89 Vestile nr.9/217, 1989] (Law regarding the usage of languages spoken on the territory of the Republic of Moldova): ''"Moldavian RSS supports the desire of the Moldovans that live across the borders of the Republic, and considering the really existing linguistical Moldo-Romanian identity - of the Romanians that live on the territory of the USSR, of doing their studies and satisfying their cultural needs in their maternal language."''</ref>

Title I, Article 13 of the Moldovan Constitution, names it the "national language" (''limba de stat'') of the country. In the [[unrecognized state]] of [[Transnistria]], it is co-official with [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].

In the [[2004 Moldovan Census|2004 census]], out of the 3,383,332 people living in Moldova, 16.5% (558,508) chose Romanian as their mother tongue, whereas 60% chose Moldovan. While 40% of all [[urban area|urban]] Romanian/Moldovan speakers chose Romanian as their mother tongue, in the country side hardly each 7th Romanian/Moldovan speaker indicated Romanian as his mother tongue.<ref>National Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Moldova: [http://www.statistica.md/recensamint.php?lang=ro Census 2004]</ref> However, the group of experts from the international census observation Mission to the Republic of Moldova concluded that the items in the questionnaire dealing with nationality and language proved to be the most sensitive ones, particularly with reference to the recording of responses to these questions as being "Moldovan" or "Romanian", and therefore it concluded that special care would need to be taken in using them.<ref>[http://azi.md/news?ID=34282 Experts Offering to Consult the National Statistics Bureau in Evaluation of the Census Data], ''Moldova Azi'', May 19, 2005, story attributed to [[AP Flux]].

Article 8 of the [[Constitution of the Republic of Serbia]] (published in the Official Gazette of RS", No. 1/90) stipulates that in the [[Republic of Serbia]] the [[Serbo-Croat language]] and the [[Cyrillic]] script shall be officially used, while the [[Latin]] script shall be officially used in the manner established by the law. In addition to that, the provision in Article 8/2 precisely determines that in the regions of the Republic of Serbia inhabited by national minorities, their own languages and scripts shall be officially used as well, in the manner established by law.

[[Image:Diagrama limba romana tari.png|left|300px|thumb|Distribution of first-language native Romanian speakers by country]]
Article 6 of the Statute of the Autonomous Province of [[Vojvodina]] (published in the "Official Gazette of APV") determines that, together with the Serbo-Croat language and the Cyrillic script, and the Latin script as stipulated by the law, the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], Romanian and [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] languages and their scripts, as well as languages and scripts of other nationalities, shall simultaneously be officially used in the work of the bodies of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, in the manner established by the law. The bodies of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina are: the Assembly, the Executive Council and the Provincial administrative bodies.<ref>[http://www.puma.vojvodina.sr.gov.yu/text.php?sek=42&vr=1&PHPSESSID=e5dca20bb275318e6915ffc24968d402 Official use of languages and scripts in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina] published by the ''Provincial Secretariat for Regulations, Administration and National Minorities''</ref>

<!-- let the Romanian language names of the municipalities, as Romanian is official there -->
The Romanian language and script are officially used in 8 municipalities: [[Alibunar]], [[Biserica Albă (Vojvodina)|Biserica Albă]], [[Zitişte]], [[Zrenianin]], [[Kovăciţa]], [[Cuvin]], [[Plandişte]] and [[Secanj]]. In the municipality of [[Vârşeţ]], Romanian is official only in the villages of Vojvodinci, Markovac, Straža, Mali Žam, Malo Središte, Mesić, Jablanka, Sočica, Ritiševo, Orešac and Kuštilj.<ref>Provincial Secretariat for Regulations, Administration and National Minorities: [http://www.puma.vojvodina.sr.gov.yu/dokumenti/sljezik.xls Official use of the Romanian language in the APV]</ref>

In the 2002 Census, the last carried out in Serbia, 1,5% Vojvodinians chose Romanian as their mother tongue (barely 0,1% of the world's Roumanophones).

===Legal status in other countries and organisations===
In other parts of Serbia the Romanian communities (see [[Vlach language (Serbia)|Vlach language]]) have very few rights regarding the use and preservation of their language in schools, press, administration and institutions.{{citation needed}}

In parts of Ukraine where Romanians constitute a significant share of the local population (districts in [[Chernivtsi Oblast|Chernivtsi]], [[Odessa Oblast|Odessa]] and [[Zakarpattia]] [[oblast]]s) the Romanian language is being taught in schools as a primary language and there are newspapers, TV, and radio broadcasting in Romanian.<ref>Ukrainian Center for Independent Political Research: [http://www.ucipr.kiev.ua/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=3384&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0], [http://www.ucipr.kiev.ua/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=3377&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0]</ref><ref>[http://www.saske.sk/cas/1-2000/gulpa-petrisce.html Slovak Academy of Sciences in Kosice]</ref>

Romanian is also an official or administrative language in various communities and organisations (such as the [[Latin Union]] and the [[European Union]]).

Romanian is one of the five languages in which religious services are performed in the autonomous monastic state of [[Mount Athos]], spoken in the ''sketae'' of Prodromos and Lacu (a ''sketa'' being a community of monks; ''sketae'' is plural).

Use of Romanian as a [[second language]] is recorded among many of the ethnic minorities in Romania, as well as Moldova. According to a 1979 census in the Moldova SSR (as it was then), approximately 4% of the population indicated Romanian/Moldovan as their second language <ref>[http://countrystudies.us/moldova/16.htm Language, religion and culture in the Moldavian SSR]</ref>.<!--this data is rather old, presumably more up-to-date figures can be found for Romania & Moldova-->

Romanian is studied and taught in some areas that have Romanian minority communities, such as [[Serbia]] ([[Vojvodina]]), [[Bulgaria]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Hungary]]. The [[Romanian Cultural Institute]] (ICR) has since 1992 organised summer training courses in Romanian for language teachers in these countries.<ref>[http://www.ziua.net/display.php?id=183071&data=2005-08-19&ziua=f08bdeacd2583ee59a42d5f08d1fba7e ''Cursuri de perfecţionare''], published in [[Ziua]] on [[August 19]], [[2005]]</ref> In some of the schools, there are non-Romanian nationals, that study Romanian as a foreign language (for example the Nicolae Bălcescu High-school in [[Gyula]], Hungary).

Romanian is taught as a [[foreign language]] in various Tertiary institutions, most prevalently in neighboring [[Europe|European]] countries (such as [[Germany]], [[France]] and [[Italy]], as well as the [[Netherlands]]) but also elsewhere, such as the [[USA]]. Overall, it is taught as a foreign language in 38 countries around the world.<ref>Romanian Language Institute: [http://www.old.edu.ro/download/ilrdoc3.pdf Data concerning the teaching of the Romanian language abroad]</ref>

=== Dialects ===
{{main|Romanian dialects}}

The term "Romanian" in a general sense envelops four hardly mutually intelligible speech varieties commonly regarded as independent languages. For more on these, please see the article "[[Eastern Romance languages]]".

It is thought that the Romanian language appeared north and south of the Danube. All the four dialects are offsprings of the [[Romance languages|Romance language]] spoken both in the North and South Danube, before the settlement of the [[Slavic peoples|Slavonian]] tribes south of the river - Daco-Romanian in the North, and the other three dialects in the south.

However, this article deals primarily with [[Daco-Romanian]], and thus the regional variations of that will be discussed here instead. The differences between these varieties are usually very small, usually consisting in a few dozen regional words and some phonetic changes.

[[Image:Romania Graiuri-mod2.jpg|thumb|340px|Romanian varieties (''graiuri'')<br />Blue: Southern varieties<br />Red: Northern varieties]]

Like all other languages, Romanian can be regarded as a [[dialect continuum]]. However, such a formulation tends to obscure the high homogeneity and uniformity of the language. The Romanian language cannot be neatly divided into separate dialects and Romanians themselves speak of the differences as accents or "speeches" (in Romanian: "accent" or "grai"). This correctly conveys the linguistics notion of [[accent (linguistics)|accent]], as language variants that only feature slight pronunciation differences (Romanian accents are fully mutually intelligible). Several accents are usually distinguished:
* Muntenian accent (Graiul muntenesc), spoken mainly in [[Wallachia]] and southern parts of Dobruja.
* Moldavian accent (Graiul moldovenesc), spoken mainly in [[Moldavia]], northern parts of [[Dobruja]] and the [[Republic of Moldova]]. Written <nowiki><p></nowiki> is realised as /k/; written <nowiki><c></nowiki> before front vowels is realised as {{IPA|/ʃ/}}. Written <nowiki><ă></nowiki>, in final position, is palatalized.
* Maramureşian accent (Graiul maramureşean), spoken mainly in [[Maramureş]].
* Transylvanian accent (Graiul ardealean), spoken mainly in [[Ardeal]].
* Banatian accent (Graiul bănăţean), spoken mainly in [[Banat]]. Written <nowiki><t></nowiki> before front vowels is realised as {{IPA|/ʧ/}}.
* Oltenian accent (Graiul oltenesc), spoken mainly in [[Oltenia]] and by the Romanian minority in [[Timok]] region of Serbia. Notable feature of this dialect is the usage of the Simple perfect tense rather than the Complex perfect which is used in other dialects.

Over the last century, however, regional accents have been weakened due to mass communications and greater mobility.

== Contacts with other languages ==
=== Dacian language ===
The [[Dacian language]] was an Indo-European language spoken by the ancient Dacians. It may have been the first language to influence the Latin spoken in Dacia, but there is very little knowledge about it. About 300 words found only in Romanian (in all dialects) or with a cognate in the [[Albanian language]] may be inherited from Dacian, many of them being related to pastoral life (for example: ''balaur'' "dragon", ''brânză'' "cheese", ''mal'' "shore"; see [[Eastern Romance substratum]]). Some linguists have asserted that Albanians are Dacians who were not Romanized, and migrated south.

A different view is that these non-Latin words (many with Albanian cognates) are not necessarily Dacian, but rather were brought into the territory that is modern Romania by Romance-speaking shepherds migrating north from Albania, Serbia, and northern Greece who became the Romanian people. However, the Eastern Romance substratum appears to have been a [[satem]] language, while the Paleo-Balkan languages spoken in Northern Greece ([[Ancient Macedonian language]]) and Albania ([[Illyrian language]]) were most likely [[centum]] languages.

The general view is that Dacian was a [[satem]] language, as was [[Thracian language|Thracian]]. Dacian was either close to the neighboring Albanian or Balto-Slavic branches of Indo-European, or a member of a distinct branch.

=== Balkan linguistic union ===
While most of Romanian grammar and morphology are based on [[Vulgar Latin]], there are some features that are shared only with other languages of the Balkans and not found in other Romance languages.

The languages of the "[[Balkan linguistic union]]" belong to distinct branches of the Indo-European language family: Bulgarian and Albanian, and in some cases [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]].

The shared features include a postposed [[Article (grammar)|definite article]], the [[syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]] of genitive and dative case, the formation of the future and perfect tenses, as well as the avoidance of infinitive.

=== Slavic languages ===
The Slavic influence was first due to the migration of Slavic tribes, which traversed the territory of present-day Romania during the early evolution of the language. It is interesting to note that Slavs were assimilated north of the Danube, whereas they almost completely assimilated the Romanized population ([[Vlachs]]) living south of Danube. An important part of this population was still Vlach in the 10th century, only to fade away along with Vlach political power. For more information about this, see [[Aromanian]] and [[Megleno-Romanian]]. The other surrounding languages (all Slavic, with the exception of Hungarian) also influenced Romanian, through centuries of mutual interactions.

Of great importance was the influence of [[Old Church Slavonic]], as it was the [[liturgical language]] of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] (compared to western and central European countries which used [[Latin]]) from the Middle Ages, until the [[18th century]].

Borrowings from Old Church Slavonic include:
''a izbăvi'' < ''izbaviti'' "to save", ''a blagoslovi'' < ''blagosloviti'' "to bless", ''blajin'' < ''blažĕnŭ'' "merciful, peaceful", ''cinste'' < ''čĩştĩ'' "honesty", ''ispravă'' < ''isprava'' "deed, accomplishment", ''vrednic'' < ''vrĕdĩnŭ'' "dignified, worthy", ''jertfă'' < ''žrŭtyva'' "sacrifice, immolation", ''mir'' < ''miro'' "chrism, holy oil".

As was characteristic of the [[Middle Ages]], the Church had a great influence on people's lives. Thus even basic words such as ''a iubi'' "to love", ''glas'' "voice", ''nevoie'' "need", and ''prieten'' "friend" are of Church Slavonic origin. Names were also influenced by the use of Slavonic in Church and in administration.

There are some Slavonic influences, both on the phonetic and on the lexical level. However, many Slavic words are [[archaism]]s and it is estimated that of the 20% of Slavic borrowings, only 10% are in use in modern Romanian.{{fact}}

=== Other influences ===
Even before the 19th century, Romanian came in contact with several other languages. Some notable examples include:
* [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''folos'' < ''ófelos'' "use", ''buzunar'' < ''buzunára'' "pocket", ''proaspăt'' < ''prósfatos'' "fresh"
* [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''oraş'' < ''város'' "town", ''a cheltui'' < ''költeni'' "to spend", ''a făgădui'' < ''fogadni'' "to promise", ''a mântui'' < ''menteni'' "to save"
* [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''cafea'' < ''kahve'' "coffee", ''cutie'' < ''kutu'' "box", ''papuc'' < ''papuç'' "slipper", ''ciorbă'' < ''çorba'' "wholemeal soup, sour soup"
* [[German language|German]]: ''cartof'' < ''Kartoffel'' "potato", ''bere'' < ''Bier'' "beer", ''şurub'' < ''Schraube'' "screw"

=== French, Italian and other international words ===
Since the [[19th century]], many modern words were borrowed from the other Romance languages, especially from [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] (for example: ''birou'' < ''bureau'' "desk, office", ''avion'' "airplane", ''exploata'' "exploit"). It was estimated that about 38% of the number of words in Romanian are of French or Italian origin and adding this to the words that were inherited from Latin, about 75%-85% of Romanian words can be traced to Latin.

In the process of lexical modernization, many of the words already existing as Latin direct heritage, as a part of its core or ''popular'' vocabulary, have been doubled by words borrowed from other [[Romance languages]], thus forming a further and more modern and literary lexical layer. Typically, the ''popular'' word is a noun and the borrowed word an adjective. Some examples:

In the 20th century, an increasing number of English words have been borrowed (such as: ''gem'' < jam; ''interviu'' < interview; ''meci'' < match; ''manager'' < manager; ''fotbal'' < football). These words are assigned grammatical gender in Romanian and handled according to Romanian rules; thus "the manager" is ''managerul''. Some of these English words are in turn Latin lexical constructions - calqued or borrowed/constructed from Latin or other Romance languages, like "management" and "interview" (from the French "entrevue").

== Grammar ==
{{main|Romanian grammar}}

Romanian nouns are inflected by gender (feminine, masculine and neuter), number (singular and plural) and case (nominative/accusative, dative/genitive and vocative). The articles, as well as most adjectives and pronouns, [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] in gender with the noun they reference.

Romanian is the only Romance language where [[Article (grammar)|definite article]]s are ''[[enclitic]]'': that is, attached to the end of the noun (as in [[North Germanic languages]]), instead of in front (''proclitic''). They were formed, as in other Romance languages, from the Latin demonstrative pronouns.

Romanian has four verbal [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]]s which further split into ten conjugation patterns. Verbs can be put in five [[mood (linguistics)|moods]] that are inflected according to the person ([[indicative mood|indicative]], [[conditional]]/[[optative mood|optative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], and [[presumptive mood|presumptive]]) and four impersonal moods ([[infinitive]], [[gerund]], [[supine]], and [[participle]]).

== Phonology ==
{{main|Romanian phonology}}

Romanian has seven [[vowel]]s: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/ə/}}, and {{IPA|/ɨ/}}. Additionally, {{IPA|/ø/}} and {{IPA|/y/}} may appear in some words.

In final positions after consonants (rarely inside words) a short non-syllabic {{IPA|/i/}} can occur, which is {{IPA2|ʲ}} and is produced as a [[palatalization]] of the preceding consonant. A similar sound, the voiceless ending ''u'', existed in old Romanian but has disappeared from the standard language.

There are also four semivowels and twenty consonants.

===Diphthongs===
Descending diphthongs: ai, au, ei, eu, ii, iu, oi, ou, ui, ăi, ău, îi, îu.

Ascending diphthongs: ea, eo, ia, ie, io, iu, oa, ua, uă.

===Triphthongs===
Pattern S-V-S (main vowel between two semivowels): eai, eau, iai, iau, iei, ieu, ioi, iou, oai.

Pattern S-S-V (two-semivowel glide before the main vowel): eoa, ioa.

===Phonetic changes===
{{main|Latin to Romanian sound changes}}

Due to its isolation from the other Romance languages, the phonetic evolution of Romanian was quite different, but does share a few changes with Italian, such as [kl] > [kj] (Lat. '''cl'''arus > Rom. '''chi'''ar, Ital. '''chi'''aro) and also a few with [[Dalmatian language|Dalmatian]], such as [gn] > [mn] (Lat. co'''gn'''atus > Rom. cu'''mn'''at, Dalm. co'''mn'''ut).

Among the notable phonetic changes are:
* diphthongization of e and o
* : Lat. c'''e'''ra > Rom. c'''ea'''ră (wax)
* : Lat. s'''o'''le > Rom. s'''oa'''re (sun)
* iotacism [e] → [ie] in the beginning of the word
* : Lat. h'''e'''rba > Rom. '''i'''arbă (grass, herb)
* velar [k], [g] → labial [p], [b], [m] before alveolar consonants:
* : Lat. o'''ct'''o > Rom. o'''pt''' (eight)
* : Lat. '''qu'''attuor > Rom. '''p'''atru (four)
* : Lat. li'''ng'''ua > Rom. li'''mb'''ă (tongue, language)
* : Lat. si'''gn'''um > Rom. se'''mn''' (sign)
* : Lat. co'''x'''a > Rom. coa'''ps'''ă (thigh)
* rotacism [l] → [r] between vowels
* : Lat. cae'''l'''um > Rom. ce'''r''' (sky)
* Alveolars [d] and [t] palatalized to [dz]/[z] and [ts] when before short [e] or long [i]
* : Lat. '''d'''eus > Rom. '''z'''eu (god)
* : Lat. '''t'''enem > Rom. '''ţ'''ine (hold)

On the other hand, it (along with French) has ''lost'' the /kw/ ('''qu''') sound from original Latin, turning it either into '''p''' (''patru'', "four"; cf. It. ''quattro'') or a hard or soft '''c''' (''când'', "when"; ''calitate'', "quality").

== Writing system ==
[[Image:Scrisoarea lui Neacsu.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Neacşu]]'s letter is the oldest surviving document written in Romanian]]
[[Image:Romanian-kirilitza-tatal-nostru.jpg|thumb|300px|A sample of the Romanian, written in the [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet]], which was still in use in the early 19th century]]

The first written record of a Romanic language spoken in the Middle Ages in the Balkans was written by the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes Confessor]] in the [[6th century]] about a military expedition against the [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] from [[587]], when a Vlach muleteer accompanying the Byzantine army noticed that the load was falling from one of the animals and shouted to a companion "Torna, torna fratre" (meaning "Return, return brother!").

The oldest written text in Romanian is a letter from late June [[1521]], in which [[Neacşu]] of [[Câmpulung]] wrote to the mayor of [[Braşov]] about an imminent attack of the Turks. It was written using the [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic alphabet]], like most early Romanian writings. The earliest writing in Latin script was a late [[16th century]] [[Transylvania]]n text which was written with the [[Hungarian alphabet]] conventions.

In the late 1700s, [[Transylvania]]n scholars noted the Latin origin of Romanian and adapted the [[Latin alphabet]] to the Romanian language, using some rules from [[Italian language|Italian]], recognized as Romanian's closest relative. The Cyrillic alphabet remained in (gradually decreasing) use until 1860, when Romanian writing was first officially regulated.

In the [[Moldavian SSR|Soviet Republic of Moldova]], a special version of the Cyrillic alphabet derived from the Russian version was used, until [[1989]], when it returned to the Romanian Latin alphabet.

=== Romanian alphabet ===
{{main|Romanian alphabet}}

The [[Romanian alphabet]] is as follows:

A, a (a); Ă, ă (ă); Â, â (â din a); B, b (be), C, c (ce); D, d (de), E, e (e); F, f (fe / ef); G, g (ghe / ge); H, h (ha / haş); I, i (i); Î, î (î din i); J, j (je), K, k (ka de la kilogram), L, l (le / el); M, m (me / em); N, n (ne / en); O, o (o); P, p (pe); R, r, (re / er); S, s (se / es); {{polytonic|Ș}} {{polytonic|ș}} ({{polytonic|ș}}e); T, t (te); {{polytonic|Ț}} {{polytonic|ț}} ({{polytonic|ț}}e); U, u (u); V, v (ve); X, x (ics); Z, z (ze / zet).

The Romanian alphabet is based on the [[Latin alphabet]], and has five additional letters (these are not diacriticals, but letters in their own right). Initially, there were as many as 12 additional letters, but some of them disappeared in subsequent reforms. Also, until the early 20th century, a short vowel marker was used.

Today, the Romanian alphabet is largely phonetic. However, the "â" (used inside the words) and "î" (used at the beginning or the end; it can also be used in the middle of a composite word, see the exception below) both represent the same [[close central unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/ɨ/}}, which is a slack sound somewhere between "i" in English "bit" and "oo" in English "food".

Until 1904 there were four letters representing the {{IPA|/ɨ/}} sound: ''â'', ''ê'', ''î'' and ''û''. By the middle of the century, through successive simplifications, only ''â'' and ''î'' remained in use. A further simplification was mandated in [[1953]] whereby ''î'' would be used exclusively, including in such words as ''România'' (which became ''Romînia'') or ''limba română'' (which became ''romînă''). For this reason, the spelling reform was perceived as an attempt of the new pro-Soviet government to delete the Romanians' national identity. In [[1965]], exceptions were made for ''România'' and the other related words; these would continue to be spelled with ''â''.

[[Image:Two Romanian spellings 1.jpg|thumb|180 px|A pair of street signs in [[Bucharest]] show the before and after of the 1993 spelling reform.]]
In [[1993]] the [[Romanian Academy]] decided to fully revert to the pre-1953 spelling rules, on the grounds that the 1953 reform was forcibly imposed by the [[Communist]]s. According to the current usage accepted by the [[Romanian Academy]], {{IPA|/ɨ/}} is transcribed as either ''î'' when used as the first or last letter of words, or ''â'' when it occurs in the middle of the word (exception: ''î'' occurs also in the middle of composite words; examples: ''bineînţeles'' cf. ''bine'' + ''înţeles'', ''reînvestire'' cf. ''re'' + ''învestire''). Also the first person singular and third person plural of the verb ''a fi'' "to be" have to be spelled and pronounced as ''sunt'' instead of the previous form ''sînt''. However this move was met with resistance, especially in the linguistic community. The Academy rules are mandatory in government organisations and in state schools. In practice, either usage is acceptable, and indeed there are publishing houses and printed magazines who use either of the two rules.

Another exception from a completely phonetic writing system is the fact that [[vowel]]s and their respective [[semivowel]]s are not distinguished in writing. In dictionaries the distinction is marked by separating the entry word into [[syllable]]s for the words containing a [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] that might be mispronounced as a [[diphthong]] or a [[triphthong]].

Stressed vowels also are not marked in writing, except very rarely in cases where by misplacing the stress a word might change its meaning and if the meaning is not obvious from the context. For example ''trei copíi'' means "three children" while ''trei cópii'' means "three copies".

Letters ''K'', ''Q'', ''W'', and ''Y'' are not part of the native Romanian alphabet; they are used mainly to write loanwords, such as ''kilogram'', ''quasar'', ''watt'', and ''yoga''.

Because early computer encoding systems did not provide the letters {{Polytonic|''ș''}} and {{Polytonic|''ț''}} (representing ({{IPA|/ʃ/}}) and {{IPA|/ʦ/}}, respectively) writing them with a cedilla (i.e., ''ş'', ''ţ'') instead of a comma below is now rather widespread. However, the [[Romanian Academy]] has declared the use of cedilla incorrect, and the use of comma below is preferable where the quality of typography is important.

===Reading rules===
Reading Romanian involves learning a few rules, quite similar to reading [[Italian language|Italian]].
* ''h'' represents {{IPA|/h/}}
* ''j'' represents {{IPA|/ʒ/}}
* There are two letters with a comma below, {{latinx|Ș}} and {{latinx|Ț}}, which represent the sounds {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/ʦ/}}. However, the allographs with a cedilla instead of a comma, ''Ş'' and ''Ţ'', became widespread when pre-[[Unicode]] and early Unicode [[character sets]] did not include the standard form.
* A final orthographical ''i'' after a consonant often represents the palatalization of the consonant (e. g. ''lup'' {{IPA|/lup/}} "wolf" vs. ''lupi'' {{IPA|/lupʲ/}} "wolves").
* ''ă'' represents the [[schwa]], {{IPA|/ə/}}.
* The letter ''e'' is generally pronounced as the [[diphthong]] ''ie'' {{IPA|/je/}} when it is in the beginning of a form of the verb ''a fi'' "to be", e. g. ''este'' {{IPA|/jeste/}} "is". This rule also applies to personal pronouns beginning with ''e'', e. g. ''el'' {{IPA|/jel/}} "he".
* ''x'' represents either the phoneme {{IPA|/ks/}} as in ''expresie'' = expression, or {{IPA|/gz/}} as in ''exemplu'' = example.
* Similarly to the reading rules in [[Italian language|Italian]], the letters ''c'' and ''g'' represent the affricates {{IPA|/ʧ/}} and {{IPA|/ʤ/}} before ''i'' and ''e'', and {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/g/}} elsewhere. When {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/g/}} are followed by vowels {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} (or their corresponding [[semivowel]]s or the final {{IPA|/ʲ/}}) the digraphs ''ch'' and ''gh'' are used instead of ''c'' and ''g'', as shown in the table below.

| ''gheţar'' (glacier), ''ghid'' (guide)

===Punctuation and capitalization===
The main particularities Romanian has relative to other languages using the Latin alphabet are:
* The quotation marks use the [[Quotation mark, non-English usage#Quotation marks in Polish|Polish format]] in the format „quote «inside» quote”, that is, 99 down and 99 up for normal quotations, with the addition of non-French double angle quotes without space for inside quotation when necessary.
* Proper quotations which span multiple paragraphs don't start each paragraph with the quotation marks; one single pair of quotation marks is always used, regardless of how many paragraphs are quoted;
* Dialogues are identified with [[Quotation mark, non-English usage#Quotation dash|quotation dashes]];
* The [[Oxford comma]] before "and" is considered incorrect ("red, yellow and blue" is the proper format);
* Punctuation signs which follow a text in parentheses always follow the final bracket;
* In titles, only the first letter of the first word is capitalized, the rest of the title using sentence capitalization (with all its rules: proper names are capitalized as usual, etc.).
* Names of months and days are not capitalized (''ianuarie'' "January", ''joi'' "Thursday")
* Adjectives derived from proper names are not capitalized (''Germania'' "Germany", but ''german'' "German")

====Exceptions and trends====
Dialogues are identified with quotation dashes in everyday use, although the specific character is typically replaced with an ordinary dash ("-") in informal electronic communication.

Usage of Polish or German quotation marks has decreased considerably in favor of the much more convenient English-language format, at least in informal messages. Even in writing, because of the awkwardness of properly drawing German dashes (reversing the direction of writing upwards for the final quotation symbol), the proper format is rarely used, typically using the [[Quotation mark#Quotation marks in Polish|Polish format]] instead (the official one), if any attempt at proper formatting is done. In practice, only the most formal documents, such as literary works or very formal letters, use what are formally considered the proper form of quotation marks.

==Language sample==
