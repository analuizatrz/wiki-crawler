The '''culture of [[Portugal]]''' is rooted in the [[Latin]] culture of [[Ancient Rome]], with a [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] background (a mixture of pre-Roman [[Celts]] and [[Iberians|Iberian]]).

==Architecture==

== Dances ==
Portugal has the traditional [[folklore]] (''Ranchos Folclóricos''), with many varieties from each region.  These dances include: [[Circle Dance]], [[Fandango]], [[Two Steps Waltz]], [[Schottische]] (Chotiça), [[Corridinho]], [[Vira]], [[Bailarico]], Vareirinha, Malhão, Vareira, Maneio, Vira de Cruz, Vira Solto, Vira de Macieira, Sapatinho, Tau-Tau, Ciranda, Zé que Fumas, Regadinho, O Pedreiro and Ó Ti Tirititi.

Portugal is a very rich country in terms of folklore. It has many regions, each one with many different characteristics.

The meaning of folklore derives from the science that studies popular traditions, like songs and dances that are from a certain region and period.

One of the most well known regions is the [[Minho]], where its dances are very energetic. “Chula”, “A Cana Verde”, “O Vira” and “O Malhão” are very charateristic dances from the Alto Minho. From the diversity of feminine apparel, the most common are work clothes and the Sunday best. All apparels have features that distinguish the rich from the poor, the most outstanding clothes of the women are the country-woman (lavradeira), the woman reaper (ceifeira), steward (mordoma) and the bride (noiva).

Some women from the Minho used to have much gold, like the bride and the country-woman. One of the symbols of this region is the Lenço do Amor ou dos Namorados that was worn by the steward (mordoma) and the bride.

Also in the same region there are os Pauliteiros de Miranda, they are very different from the other groups, because they are formed only by men and their clothes are very special. They wear a white shirt and skirt with ruffles and lace and a black jacket with colourful bands. In dances they use two sticks (palotes) and their symbol is a Capa de Honra, that was worn by people from high society.

Closer to the centre of Portugal is [[Nazaré]]. This region is frequently associated with the sea, and fishery. The fishermen are normally shoeless, but sometimes they have wooden-shoes. The well known symbol from Nazaré is the seven skirts (Nazarena das sete saias). They wear seven colourful skirts, and the myth says that it represents the seven days of the week, the seven colours of the rainbow and the meaning of seven in the bible.

Closer to the south is the [[Ribatejo]]. Its music is elegant and harmonious. The richest men’s apparel are the ceremonial clothes, that are black trousers and jacket and a white shirt. To the wedding, the bride had to cover her head with a kerchief. The well known dance from Ribatejo is the Fandango. This dance is charaterized by a man and a woman and was considered a dance of sedution.

The herdsman (campino) is the most well-known Ribatejo’s apparel. At work he wore a black jacket, with black trousers and a white shirt. The celebration clothes are the ones that people recognize better and are green breeches, red jacket and a white shirt too. These clothes are completed by a red band and a red and green cap.

The corridinho is considered the biggest expression of the [[Algarve]]’s popular dances. This music was danced in pairs. However this dance wasn’t only danced in the Algarve, it was also danced in Estremadura. In the Algarve there was also the water-man (aguadeiro), the shepherd (pastor) and the woman-baker (padeira).

Portugal also has two archipelagos with different traditions. In folklore of [[Madeira]] there is the woman, seriguilha, and the vilão apparels. The female clothes are composed of a flax chemise, a red jacket and a skirt with vertical colourful stripes. On the head they wear the carapuça. The seriguilha’s apparel is brown and consists of trousers, a flax shirt, like the previous, a jacket and a cap. The Vilão’s clothes have shirt and trousers made of flax, a carapuça. The symbol from Madeira is the Brinquinho. It is a typical instrument, which has dolls made of wood wearing that traditional apparel, castanets and narrow ribbons. It is made around a cane and is moved by a person vertically. This is the regional instrument, however it is used only in the Bailinho, that now-a-days represent the popular Madeira dances.
	
The [[Açores]] is made up of nine major islands and eight small formigas.   There are differences and similarities in music, such as Manjericão, Tirana, Sapateia, Pezinho and Chamarrita. They have also special shoes, albarcas, that are made of leather.

== Cinema ==

Portugal’s cinematographic repertoire is indeed quantitatively small (in the 1990’s around 10 fullength fictional works were produced each year) and its filmmakers are not organised along industrial lines, but rather practise a very special kind of artisanal craft. The hundred or so films made during the course of the last decade were directed by nearly sixty different people – something which says nothing but good about the country’s cinematographic panorama. Most filmmakers are not able to make more than one film a decade and the exceptions can almost be counted on the fingers of one hand. 

When it comes to financing, Portuguese cinema survives solely thanks to the massive presence of state grants and the input of television stations. The internal market is very small and Portuguese penetration of international markets is fairly precarious, thus making it impossible to earn a reasonable return on investment. A film is considered success when it draws an audience of more than 150,000 and very few Portuguese films manage to do so. And yet Portuguese cinematography possesses something very special. The filmgoers who frequent the main European film festivals have become used to regularly seeing Portuguese films of a constancy and quality that make Portugal one of the most interesting melting-pots of director-controlled cinema.

The great master of the Portuguese cinema is [[Manoel de Oliveira]], an amazing example of vitality and talent. He made his first film when the movies were silent. At the age of ninety three, Oliveira remains active and continues to create at an impressive rate. Since 1990 he has made an average of one film per year, directed major international stars that have succumbed to the lure of his talent, received the most varied awards and won the respect of the cinematography community all over the world. 

Manoel de Oliveira is respected throughout Europe as the father of Portuguese cinema. His long, illustrious career, and particularly his steadfast refusal to compromise his art in any way, inspired a whole new generation of Portuguese directors. In Europe, Oliveira is revered as a cultural treasure, and the introduction to North American audiences provide by this retrospective is long overdue.       
 
His fame extends to the United States, where the retrospectives of his works have been shown at the Los Angles Film Festival (1992), the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC (1993), the San Francisco Film Festival and the Cleveland Museum of Art (1994). On top of all this, his films have begun to be successful at the box office too.

In one of the great ironies of international cinema, the films of Oliveira and other Portuguese directors have been ignored by popular audiences within Portugal itself. However, since the 1974 revolution, the central government and other organizations have supported film production as a cultural imperative. As a result, Portuguese directors have largely remained free from commercial pressures and have been able to chase their own interests.   
Another of the major figures of Portuguese cinema is [[João César Monteiro]]. A member of the generation which founded the so-called “New Portuguese Cinema” in the 1960’s, it was only from the mid 1970’s that his work achieved its full expression. He was one of the most original European directors, made extremely provocative films in which the base meets the sublime. The key landmarks of his work in the 1990’s include “ O Último Mergulho”(1992), “ A Comédia de Deus” (1995), “Le Bassin de John Wayne” (1997) and “As Bodas de Deus”  (1998). “A Comédia de Deus” won the Jury’s Special Prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1995.

Amongst the younger generation, it is only fair to single out [[Teresa Villa Verde]]. Having begun her career with an ephemeral passage before Cesar Monteiro’s cameras (À Flor do Mar, 1986), in the 1990’s she surfaced as a director. Her films are full of duffering and tend to be stories about adolescent characters that came into various kinds of conflicts with society around them. One of her films (Três Irmãos, 1994) was to win Maria de Medeiros (a very famous actress in Portugal) the best actress award at the [[Venice Film Festival]].


'''→Portuguese comedies'''
'''''A Canção de Lisboa:''''' (lit. Lisbon Song) is a Portuguese film comedy from 1933, directed by [[José Cottinelli Telmo]], and starring Vasco Santana and Beatriz Costa. Manoel de Oliveira had a minor role in this film.
It was the second Portuguese sound feature film (the first was A Severa, a 1931 documentary by Manoel de Oliveira, was originally filmed without soundtrack, which was added afterwards), and still is one of the best loved films in Portugal. Several of its lines and songs are still quoted today!       

'''''O Pai Tirano:''''' (lit. The Tyrant Father) is a Portuguese film comedy from 1941, directed by António Lopes Ribeiro, starring [[Vasco Santana]], [[Francisco Ribeiro]] and [[Leonor Maia]]. It’s one of the best known comedies of the Golden Age of Portuguese Cinema. Still popular six decades after its release.
A whole slice of aspiring working class, aspiring to the urban low – middle class and respectable, a farce within a farce to have you laughing out loud.
  
 
'''''Pátio das Cantigas:''''' (lit. The Courtyard of Songs) A comedy/ musical from 1942 directed by Francisco Ribeiro, with Vasco Santana (as Narciso), [[António Silva]] (as Evaristo), Francisco Ribeiro (as Rufino) and others. It’s a portrait of the relations between neighbours in a Lisbon courtyard. A story made of small episodes of humor, friendship, rivalry and love.
This one of the most hilarious films ever made in Portugal. It’s full of those little jokes that everybody remembers, even today! The actors transformed this rather simple story into a masterpiece! This movie must be seen.
 

'''→Recent films'''
'''''O Crime do Padre Amaro:''''' (lit. The Crime of Father Amaro) it’s a Portuguese film (2005) adapted from a book of Eça de Queiroz, directed by Carlos Coelho da Silva. This was a low quality production sponsored by SIC (television Channel). Even so this film beat all the records of box- office of all the Portuguese films in Portugal. The main characters are [[Jorge Corrula]] as Padre Amaro and [[Soraia Chaves]] as Amélia, and the main ingredients of this film are the sex and the nudity.
 
 
'''''Zona J:'''''is a Portuguese drama/romance film directed by Leonel Vieira in 1998, starring   [[Sílvia Alberto]] as Fátima, [[Ana Bustorff]] as Conceição.
 
 
'''''Sorte Nula:''''' (lit. The Trunk) directed by [[Fernando Fragata]], starring Helder Mendes, António Feio, Adelaide de Sousa, [[Rui Unas]], Isabel Figueira, Bruno Nogueira, Carla Matadinho, Tânia Miller and Zé Pedro. Some people say that it wasn’t a good film and others affirm that was the best Portuguese film. The opinions about this film differ a lot!

== Literature ==

Throughout different schools, generations and mostly movements, Portuguese Literature evolved to what is now known as Contemporary Literature. 
 
It is believed that Portuguese literature was born in the 12th century with the lyrical works by [[João Soares de Paiva]] and [[Paio Soares de Taveirós]]. Their works came mostly from Portuguese oral traditions usually known as “cantigas de amor e amigo” and “cantigas de escárnio e maldizer” which were sung by troubadours.  
 
Fiction has its roots in chronicles and historiographic studies that were written after the 14th century by great chroniclers such as [[Fernão Lopes]] who wrote extended texts about Portuguese kings’ lives. In Theater one of the most known Portuguese names is [[Gil Vicente]], whose works criticised faithfully the society of his time.
 
Portuguese Literature evolved with classical lyrical texts which remain as great marks in Portuguese history. (Os Lusíadas, by [[Luís de Camões]] is known overseas as the great masterpiece of Portuguese Literature). On Romanticism there is a lot to be said.  Names such as: [[Antero de Quental]], [[Almeida Garrett]] and [[Camilo Pessanha]] are important to that specific moment of Portuguese literature’s history. 
 
Modernism is maybe the most well known literary movement in Portuguese.  [[Fernando Pessoa]] is considered to be (just like Camões) one of the greatest Portuguese writers of all times.  Even though Portugal is known as a “country of poets”, this country has a good portfolio of novel writers since Romanticism and Realism.
 
After the Carnation Revolution which brought freedom of speech to Portuguese people after several decades of repression, Portuguese Literature faced a new moment of writing which only Pessoa had reached before in this country. 
 
Recently, a Portuguese writer ([[José Saramago]]) was granted with the Nobel Prize for Literature which comes to show that Portuguese Literature is still appreciated all over the world.

==Music==

Portuguese musical traditions and contemporary popular music are highly diverse and dynamic. They reflect multifarious historical, cultural, and political processes to which they also contributed. Others resulted from the confluence of multiple cultural influences, including those that were the outcome of Portugal’s direct and prolonged contact with non-European cultures from both North and sub-Saharan Africa and Brazil.

In particular, the 1960s marked the beginning of a period of expansion and innovation on the Portuguese music that has continued up until the present day. Rock and jazz were introduced, political song developed, Lisbon fado and the Coimbra style of singing were revitalized, Portuguese styles of pop and rock evolved, music from the former African colonies and Brazil occupied an increasingly important place in the capital’s musical life and local styles of rap and hip hop emerged.

Polyphonic music, employing multiple vocal parts in harmony, was developed in the 15th century. The Renaissance fostered a rich output of compositions for solo instruments and ensembles as well as for the voice. The modern revival of academic music in Portugal was primarily work of Luís de Freitas Branco, whose has been perpetuated by Joly Braga Santos. Composers like António Victorino d'Almeida, Jorge Peixinho, Miguel Azguime, Pedro Amaral, and João Pedro Oliveira acquired prestige both at home and abroad. Orchestras of note include the Orquestra Sinfónica Portuguesa and the Gulbenkian Orchestra. Oporto has had its own symphony orchestra since 1962, when the Chamber Orchestra was set up by the Gulbenkian Foundation. Lisbon also has a metropolitan orchestra, and the National Theatre of São Carlos in Lisbon, which was built in the late 18th century, has its own orchestra and ballet company. Among notable pianists, Maria João Pires has won worldwide acclaim. 

Cultural centres such as the Belém Cultural Centre and the Culturgest, both in Lisbon, have expanded opportunities for major concerts. Madredeus is among the most successful popular music groups. Singer Dulce Pontes is also widely admired, and Carlos Paredes is considered by many to be Portugal's finest guitarist. Folk music and dancing and the traditional fado remain the country's fundamental forms of musical expression.


'''→Fado'''
A shawl, a guitar, a voice and heartfelt emotion. These are the ingredients of Fado, the celebrated form of world music that captures what it is to be Portuguese.

Inspiration for Fado can come from almost any source. Although there are predominance of themes like: destiny, deep-seated feelings, disappointments in love, the sense of sadness and longing for someone who has gone away, misfortune, the ups and downs of life, the sea,  the life of sailors and fishermen, and last but not least “Saudade” (one of the main themes used in fado, that means a kind of longing).  

Fado is probably the oldest urban folk music in the world and represents the heart of the Portuguese soul, and for that matter fado performance is not successful if an audience is not moved to tears.



'''History of Fado'''
Listening to Fado is like visiting Lisbon, meeting the Portuguese people, those that once upon a time faced the unknown sea. This type of music that connected nobles, vagabonds and seafarers, is still nowadays a shared passion by all Portuguese.

By the early twentieth century, Fado had become a fixture in the everyday life of Lisbon’s working class. It was played for pleasure and also to relieve the pain of life. Fadistas, skilled singers that performed at the end of the day and long into the night. Fado was the earthly music of taverns, brothels and street corners mainly in Alfama, Mouraria, Bairro Alto and Madragoa. Fado reached its golden era in the first half of the 20th century, when the Portuguese dictatorship of Salazar (1926-1968) forced the fado performers to become professional and confined them to sing in the fado houses and the so called "revistas", a popular genre of "vaudeville". The main names of this period were: Alfredo Marceneiro, Amália Rodrigues, Maria Teresa de Noronha and Armandinho and Jaime Santos (guitar players).

Fado became popular thanks to the singer Maria Severa who lived in the first half of the 19th century and died at the age of 26. She made this type of song famous in aristocratic circles through her romance with the Count of Vimioso. Her life later became the subject of Portugal's first sound movie in 1931. To this day, female performers wear a black shawl in her memory and her life story has been the influence of several Fado songs, poems, novels, and plays. However, fado has been shaped by those who have sung it. 

Fado can be performed by men or women, although the raw emotion of the female fadista is nearly always preferred. Dressed in black with a shawl draped over her shoulders, a fadista stands in front of the musicians and communicates through gesture and facial expressions. The hands move, but the body remains stationary. It’s a solemn and majestic performance.

Traditionally accompanied by the Portuguese guitar, there are many ways of singing the Fado. It can range from the faster Fado corrido of Mouraria, to the impromptu singing known as ‘desgarrada’, or the mournful music of the students of Coimbra. There is also a version that describes conquests, love affairs and different life experience of each neighborhood, immortalized by the artist José Malhoa in his famous paintings of the Fado. And the well known Fado Vadio (Vagrant Fado), which is characterized by the place where it was born and sang for so long, the streets! Though it is an expression that is in risk of vanishing. It’s one of the most traditional forms of Fado, but nowadays fadistas cannot sing in the middle of the streets, it’s illegal.
From the 1940’s until 1999 Fado was shown to the world through the voice of one amazing artist, Amália Rodrigues, the towering figure of Portuguese fado. Possessing a great stage presence and being a natural entertainer, she was worshipped and celebrated as the most famous representative of Portuguese culture. In the 20th century she made Fado known beyond Portugal, performing all over Europe, Japan, South America, and even in the United States, in New York's "La Vie en Rose" in the 1950s. When she died the country’s prime minister called for three days of national mourning, and as a national icon, she was buried in Lisbon's National Pantheon. Her former residence is now a museum that is well worth a visit. Amália has found a worthy successor in Mariza, who takes Fado to an even wider audience. Other very important names of Fado are Maria da Fé, Hermínia Silva, Argentina Santos and Carlos do Carmo.

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:AmaliaRodrigues.jpg]] -->

Nowadays in Portugal, the younger generation respects fado but isn’t dedicated to it. Contemporary fado musicians like Misia have introduced the music to performers such as Sting. Misia and fadistas like Cristina Branco and Mariza walk the fine line between carrying on the tradition and trying to bring in a new audience. Dulce Pontes, Camané, Mafalda Arnauth and Katia Guerreiro are other sonant artists that keep Fado alive, and brought with them a new look to the traditional song, occasionally reviving 19th century fado. The youngest world-traveling ''fadista'' of today and a top "New Generation of Fado" singer is Joana Amendoeira.

Fado cannot be explained, it must be felt and experienced. Once audiences are very knowledgeable and very demanding, the fadista must have the soul to transmit that feeling. The Grand Night of Fado is held every year in Lisbon and Oporto, and without a doubt it is the perfect place to enjoy a sample of this traditional music, it’s a very special evening that showcases the best new musical talents, an event that helps to launch careers and discover unique voices.

'''Where did it come from?'''
The word Fado comes from the Latin fatum, which means fate or destiny. Actually the name couldn’t be better chosen. Fado, in a certain way, represents better than anything the spirit of the Portuguese people: the belief in destiny as something that overwhelms us and from which we can't escape, the domination of the soul and heart over reason, which leads to acts of passion and despair, and reveal such a black and beautiful sorrow.
There are many theories about the origin of Fado. Therefore we are going to name a few:

'''1-''' Fado has its origin in Moorish songs; Moors kept living near Lisbon even after the Christian take-over. The melancholy of those songs and the referral in many lyrics to Mouraria in Lisbon would strengthen this theory.

'''2-''' Fado arrived to Portugal with the sailors returning from their long trips (1822), under the form of Lundum (the music of the Brazilian slaves). Lundum only after a while started modifying until it became the Fado. The first songs of the kind were related to the sea and with the lands far beyond them, where the slaves lived. This fact supports this theory, among one of Amália's songs, called "The Black Boat" which talks precisely of a senzala (place where the slaves were kept).

'''3-''' The melancholy character of Fado evolved from Portuguese seafarers who sang of home during their long absences at sea.

'''4-''' Fado was born in the Middle Ages. As ''cantigas de amigo'' (friend songs) are a good example of it. They were love songs dedicated to a woman and have great similarities with diverse subjects of the Fado of Lisbon. Those that were sung by the man to a woman seem to find kinship in the Fado of Coimbra, where the students intone their songs beneath the window of the loved one (serenades). Furthermore, there were satire songs or of disdain, that are still today frequent themes for Fado, in social and political critics. 

Besides the lack of proofs about the origin of Fado, once in Portugal, it’s possible to affirm that Fado seems to have first appeared in Lisbon and Oporto, being later taken to Coimbra with the University students (having acquired different characteristics).


'''Coimbra’s Fado:'''
There are two main varieties of fado, namely those of the cities of Lisbon and Coimbra. The Lisbon style is the most popular, while Coimbra's is the more refined style. Some of their characteristics are that in Lisbon it is always sung by a solo performer on the contrary, in Coimbra it is often performed by groups of male university students. Both are accompanied by two guitarists, one playing the melody on a twelve-stringed Portuguese guitar and the other supplying the rhythm on the six-stringed viola.     
In Coimbra we find the usual Fado’s sad style, but with different motivations and also based in the medieval songs called ''trovas''. The ex-libris of Coimbra are its students, that arriving from Lisbon and Oporto, took their guitars and the new playing style was adopted. It was used to impress their loved ones they would sing all night long about their anguish for not having them, putting in their hands a heart full of sorrows that only them could relive. Moreover to explain the dissatisfaction of leaving behind the best years of the youth, the student bohemian life. And so it became the official music for the goodbye songs of each year, and for the students. Nowadays their performances constitute a basic ingredient in the city’s annual academic rituals, they are called Tunas. Those are groups of students that sing with their academicals and their heavy cape on, to do serenades or honor their Faculty. There are Tunas in almost every Portuguese University nowadays, there are many competitions between them, but only in Coimbra does the serenade tradition remain. One of the celebrations made in Coimbra to mark the beginning of a new academic year is the Monumental Serenata (monumental serenade), when serenades are sung outside the entrance to the city’s old cathedral. But for some Coimbra students, Fado is not just for days of youth. Adriano Correia de Oliveira and José Afonso both became famous singers, while Artur Paredes and Carlos Paredes became well-known guitarists.

'''"Coimbra is more enchanting when it’s time to bid farewell."'''
This is the most famous line from this city’s Fado. It sums up the romantic spirit of the university students who sing it.


'''Fado Houses:'''
The best place to enjoy an evening of Fado is for sure a Fado House. A candlelit dinner, accompanied by songs you’ll understand without even speaking the language, is an experience that you simply have to live. Combined with the Fado Museum where its evolution is explained and the passion behind the country's famous musical expression with audiovisual presentations, wax figures, multilingual information panels, and musical archives. It presents the cultural and social impact of Fado, from its use in cinema through the impact of censorship in the 20th century. 


'''Nevertheless...'''
Please note that despite Fado being a symbol of the Portuguese nationality, it is, by no means, the national song. From region to region, Portugal possesses several rich and typical folklores of each geographical area that have nothing to do with Fado. Perhaps we can, if you want, to say that this will be the form of folklore of Lisbon, Oporto and Coimbra. However, it is appreciated and recognized in all the Portuguese country as a symbol. 
This is the spirit of fado, the expression of a collective soul, made of each one's soul.

'''Portuguese Traditional Music'''
In all the times and all places mankind always showed great ingenuity making sound and music from existing materials in its natural environment. The voice and the clapping of hands can certainly be considered the first instrumental forms used by Man.
The Iberian Peninsula was home to a lot of different people and cultures so its normal to these cultures to influence the others but still retain a little of their aspects, this happened with the Portuguese music. Even in the present you can find types of instruments from different places, such as the bagpipes and the Arab adufe, but they are now and forever a part of the Portuguese culture. From the Pauliteiros of Miranda to the Corridinho in Algarve the traditional music and songs transpire a poetic character that tells the history of a community to other people and generations to come.

'''→Popular music:'''
The 1980s and 1990s were marked by the search for a new musical discourse in urban popular music, the increase, commodification and industrialization of musical production, and the mediatization and expansion of music consumption. The boom in Portuguese musical production was accompanied by both the diversification of the musical domains and styles produced and consumed in Portugal and the emergence of new styles which are increasingly taking the global market into account. The denominated Pop music uses melodies easily to memorize, becoming very popular and commercial; it’s also characterized by the amount of publicity made (through videos, magazines, appealing clothing, etc).  
It is possible to note two stylistic tendencies in the popular music of the 1980s and 1990s:
 
- A musical discourse created by Portuguese musicians that is integrated within the major international developments experienced by commercial popular music;
 
- A new musical style that vindicates its Portugueseness by both drawing upon various musical elements which musicians and audiences alike identify as Portuguese and emphasizing the Portuguese language.

'''→Folk:'''
Folk music is the joint of the traditional songs of a community that express through a poetic character their beliefs and tell their history to other people and generations.  The danças do vira (Minho), Pauliteiros de Miranda (Miranda), Corridinho do Algarve or Bailinho (Madeira), are some examples of dances created by the sound of folk. Some of the typical instruments used are a little guitar, bagpipes, accordion, violin, drums, Portuguese guitar and an enormous variety of wind and percussion instruments.


----

'''→Philharmonic band:'''
In the popular culture the philharmonic bands represent each locality and play different types of music, from popular to classical. Lidia Costa, Carlos Marques, Alberto Madurai, José Caminos and Railcar Morays are some of the most important names in philharmonic music.


----

'''→Political Songs:'''
Political songs (canções de intervenção) played an important part in the protests against the totalitarian regime that ruled Portugal from 1926 up to the 1974 revolution. Once it was created as an object to criticize what was wrong, mainly in a political point of view. One of its main protagonists was José (Zeca) Afonso (1929-1987) but others also contributed to its development, for example Adriano Correia de Oliveira, José Mário Branco, Luís Cilia, Francisco Fanhais, José Jorge Letria, José Barata Moura and Sérgio Godinho. They traced a new course for urban popular music and influenced a further generation of musicians, some of whom also participated in the protest movement and are still active, including Fausto, Vitorino, Janita Salomé and Júlio Pereira, among others.
This musical style reflects a confluence of influences from traditional music, French urban popular songs of the 1960s, African music and Brazilian popular music. By the late 1970s the revolutionary climate had subsided and the need to express political militancy through song was no longer felt by poets, composers and singers, who subsequently redefined both their role and their creative contribution.


----

'''→Classical Music:'''
In Classical music the greater references that Portugal has are the piano players Artur Pizarro, Maria João Pires e Sequeira Costa, and the composers: Fernando Lopes-Graça, Emmanuel Nunes, Jorge Peixinho, Constança Capdeville, Clotilde Rosa, Fernando Corrêa de Oliveira, Cláudio Carneyro, Frederico de Freitas, Joly Braga Santos and Isabel Soveral.

'''→Hip hop:'''
Out of the American movies from the 80’s the hip hop invaded Portugal and has established itself on the streets of Lisbon and Oporto. Areas like Chelas, Amadora, Cacém and the South Bank of the Tagus are considered to be the cradle of Portuguese Hip Hop (Hip Hop Tuga).
From America the hip hop brought the street wear fashion, now used in Portugal by younger people, and the four basic hip hop elements: MC’ing, DJ’ing, break-dance and graffiti.
It was with the album called “Rapublica” released in 1994 from the band Black Company, that hip hop officially established itself on Portugal, and you could see that it was here to stay. The refrain from a song called “Não sabe nadar, yo” (“Cant swim, yo!”) was on the mouths of everyone, even the president of Portugal, Mario Soares, used it on a speech about the cave painting in Foz Côa saying that “As gravuras não sabem nadar, yo!” (“The paintings can’t swim, yo!”).
Nowadays there is a division in the Portuguese hip hop movement, from one side we got the pure or the underground as it is called, on the other side we got the one that is fabricated, so to speak, that you get on the gymnasium or MTV. But the real Hip Hop resides in the heart and soul of those who feel it as a life philosophy and not an “USA made trend”. 

Portugal has two main events where the country's hip hop is showcased, [[Flowfest]] and [[Hip Hop Porto]]. [[Flowfest]], in Coimbra, started in 2005 and counts with a marketing campaign to draw attention to it all year round, until the real event in March or April. In 2006, its tagline was "Poesia nos Pratos" ("Poetry on the Dishes", dishes meaning the DJ's turntable). Already pumping up for the 2007's edition, the tagline has been named as "Próximo Nível" ("Next Level"), and counts with names such as Sam The Kid, SP & Wilson, Sir Scratch, Sickscore, SBT2 and Wandering Style Crew. [[Hip Hop Porto]] is a free event held at Casa da Música, in September. It features mainly the northern hip hop names as headliners, drawing a very local audience. Its first edition in 2005 carded Rodney P, NBC, Blackmastah, Bomberjack, Rui Miguel Abreu, etc. Usually the event is held outdoors, but in 2006 the heavy rains made the event relocate to the parking lot of the building, causing a really "underground" look.


----

'''→Summer musical festivals:'''
We couldn’t write about Portuguese music, without referring the summer festivals. Every year there are several music festivals all over the country, but in summer each day is a different one. There we can find Portuguese musicians and not only, because musicians from other countries are often invited to play here. They occur all summer and it’s almost impossible to go to all of them, but their quality is growing every year. People camp in the enclosed space and can spend a wonderful summer, knowing Portugal better and at the same time listening to their favorite bands. Here are some examples of those festivals: Vilar de Mouros, Sudoeste, [[Rock in Rio]], Super Bock Super Rock, Paredes de Coura, Ilha do Ermal, etc.

== Painting ==
Portuguese art was very restricted in the early years of nationality, during the [[reconquista]], to a few paintings in churches, convents and palaces.
[[Image:St-vin.jpg|thumb|120px|''St. Vicent Panels (detail)'' by Nuno Gonçalves]]<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:VieiraSilva.jpg|thumb|120 px|''Angel'' by Vieira da Silva, oil on canvas]] -->

It was after the [[15th century]], with the national borders established and with the discoveries, that Portuguese art expanded. Some kings, like [[John of Portugal|John I]] already had royal painters. It is during this century that Gothic art was replaced by a more humanistic and Italian-like art. 

During the reign of King [[Alfonso V of Portugal|Alfonso V]], an important Portuguese artist [[Nuno Gonçalves]] shaped Portuguese art, leading it to gain local characteristics (''Escola Nacional'', National School). His influence on Portuguese art continued after his death. He was the royal painter for the famous ''Retábulo do Altar das Relíquias de São Vicente'' in the Cathedral of Lisbon (''Sé de Lisboa''). The painting caught fire and was replaced by a Baroque structure. Parts of his work still exist and can be found in the ''Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga National'' (Museum of Ancient Art).

During the Golden Age of Portugal, in the late [[15th century]] and early [[16th century]], Portuguese artists were influenced by Flemish art, and were in turn influential on Flemish artists of the same period. During this period, Portuguese art became internationally well-known, mostly because of its very original and diverse characteristics, but little is known about the artists of this time due to the medieval culture that considered painters to be artisans. The anonymous artists in the Portuguese "escolas" produced art not only for metropolitan Portugal but also for its colonies, namely [[Malacca]] or [[Goa]] and even [[Africa]], gratifying the desires of local aristrocatic clients and religious clients.
In the 19th century naturalist and realist painters like [[Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro|Columbano]], [[Henrique Pousão]] and [[Silva Porto]] revitalized painting against a decadent academic art.
In the early [[20th century]] [[Portugal|Portuguese]] art increased both in quality and quantity, mainly due to members of the [[Modernist]] movement like [[Amadeo de Souza Cardoso]] and [[Almada Negreiros]]. In the post-war years the abstractionist painter [[Vieira da Silva]] settled in Paris and gained widespread recognition, as did his contemporary [[Paula Rego]].


== Theatre ==
Portugal never developed a great Dramatic theatre tradition due primarily to the fact that the Portuguese were more passionate about lyric or humorous works than dramatic art. [[Gil Vicente]] is often seen has the father of Portuguese theatre - he was the leading Portuguese [[playwright]] in the [[16th century]]. During the [[20th century]], theatre found a way to reach out to the people, specially the middle class, through what in Portugal is known as "[[Revista]]" - a form of humorous and cartoonish theatre designed to expose and criticize social (and political) issues, but in a way that entertains and amuses the audience.

Gil Vicente (1435-1536) is considered the first great Portuguese playwright. Frequently called the father of Portuguese theatre, he portrays the society of the 16th century. Following Molière’s well-known phrase “ridendo castigat mores”, Gil Vicente became famous for his satirical plays such as the “Triologia das Barcas” (“Auto da Barca do Inferno” (1517), “Auto da Barca do Purgatório” (1518); “Auto da Barca da Glória” (1518)). In these plays, he creates some characters who are representative of their social group. This results in not only comical, but also strong critical situations. Gil Vicente also wrote other important plays such as “Auto da Índia” (1509), “Auto da Fama” (1510), and “Farsa de Inês Pereira” (1523).

Another relevant playwright of the 16th century is António Ferreira (1528-1569), who wrote “A Castro” (1587), a well-known tragedy about the forbidden love between D. Pedro I and D. Inês de Castro. António Ferreira is considered the father of Renaissance culture in Portugal.

One of the most famous playwrights of the 18th century is António José da Silva (1705-1739), commonly known as “O Judeu” because of his Judaic origins. He wrote several plays such as “Os Encantos de Medeia” (1735), “As Variedades de Proteu” (1737) and “Precipício de Faetonte” (1738).

Almeida Garrett (1799-1854) was a turning point in Portuguese literature as far as the themes are concerned. His most outstanding play is “Frei Luís de Sousa” (1844), which became a classic of Portuguese theatre. Garrett also wrote “Um Auto de Gil Vicente” (1838), “Filipa de Vilhena” (1846) and “O Alfageme de Santarém” (1842). These three plays as well as “Frei Luís de Sousa” are somehow connected with Portuguese history. Furthermore, Garrett is also the founder of the “Conservatório Geral de Arte Dramática” as well as of the “Teatro Nacional D. Maria II”.
As far as the 20th century is concerned, it’s worth noticing Bernardo Santareno’s (1920-1980) work. His most famous play is “O Judeu”, based upon the life of António José da Silva, mentioned above. Santareno also wrote “A Promessa” (1957), “O Crime da Aldeia Velha” (1959) and “Anunciação” (1962). Most of his plays deal with universal questions such as liberty, oppression and discrimination.

Born in 1926, Luís de Sttau Monteiro (1926-1993) wrote several plays, some of them portraying and criticising Portuguese society of his time. His most famous play is “Felizmente Há Luar” (1961), which is a strong criticism of the political context of that time (dictatorship – Estado Novo). “O Barão” (1965), “A Guerra Santa” (1967) and “Sua Excelência” (1971) were also written by Sttau Monteiro.

In the 20th century theatre in Portugal became more popular with the “Revista” – a comical and satirical form of theatre. It is a creative way of expressing one’s ideas as well as criticising political and social problems. The most important actors who performed this form of theatre in the 20th century were Vasco Santana (1898-1958), Beatriz Costa (1907-1996) and Ivone Silva (1935-1987). Nowadays it is worth mentioning Maria João Abreu, José Raposo and Fernando Mendes, who perform this form of theatre at the well known “Parque Mayer” (a theatre in Lisbon where the “Revista” used to be performed).

Other outstanding Portuguese actors are Ruy de Carvalho, Eunice Muñoz, Rui Mendes, Irene Cruz and Luís Miguel Cintra.

== Food ==
{{main|Portuguese cuisine}}

Each region of Portugal has its traditional dishes, including various kinds of meat, seafood, fresh fish (including 1001 ways of making [[cod]] dishes, the national dish; and grilled sardines) and the famous "Cozido à Portuguesa".

== Wines ==
{{main|Wines of Portugal}}

Portugal is the country for [[wine]] lovers, known since the [[Roman Empire]]; the Romans immediately associated Portugal with its God of Wine and Feasts, [[Bacchus]]. Today, many Portuguese wines are known as some of the world's best: [[Vinho do Douro]], [[Vinho do Alentejo]], [[Vinho do Dão]], [[Vinho Verde]], and the sweet: [[Port Wine]] (Vinho do Porto, literally Porto's wine), [[Madeira wine]], [[Moscatel]] of Setúbal and [[Moscatel]] of Favaios.

==Festivals and holidays==
During the summer, in the month of June, festivities dedicated to three saints known as ''Santos Populares'' take place all over Portugal. Why the populace associated the saints to these pagan festivities is not known. But they are possibly related to Roman or local deities from the time before Christianity spread in the region. The three saints are [[Anthony of Padua|Saint Anthony]], [[John the Apostle|Saint John]] and [[Saint Peter]]. Common fare in these festivities are wine, ''água-pé'' (mostly grape juice), and traditional bread along with sardines. During the festivities are many weddings, traditional street dances and fireworks.

Saint Anthony is celebrated on the night of 12th-13th of June, especially in [[Lisbon]] (where that saint was born and lived most of his life), with ''Marchas Populares'' (a street carnival) and other festivities. In the meantime, several marriages known as ''Casamentos de Santo António'' (Marriages of Saint Anthony) are made. But the most popular saint is Saint John, he is celebrated in many cities and towns throughout the country on the night of the 23rd-24th, especially in [[Porto]] and [[Braga]], where the sardines, ''Caldo Verde'' (traditional soup) and plastic hammers to hammer in another person's head for luck are indispensable. The final saint is Saint Peter, celebrated in the night of 28th-29th, especially in [[Póvoa de Varzim]] and [[Barcelos]], the festivities are similar to the others, but more dedicated to the sea and with an extensive use of fire (''fogueiras''). In Póvoa de Varzim, there is the ''Rusgas'' in the night, another sort of street carnival. Each festivity is a municipal holiday in the cities and towns where it occurs.

[[Carnival]] is also widely celebrated in Portugal, some traditional carnivals date back several centuries. Loulé, Alcobaça, Mealhada and above all Ovar hold several days of festivities, with parades where social and political criticism abound, music, dancing in an environment of euphorya. On [[January 6]], [[Epiphany (feast)|Epiphany]] is celebrated by some families, especially in the North, where the family gathers to eat "Bolo-Rei" (literally, King Cake, a cake made with crystallized fruits); this is also the time for the traditional street songs - "As Janeiras" (The January ones). [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin Day]], is celebrated on [[November 11]]. This day is the peak of three days, often with very good weather, it is known as ''Verão de São Martinho'' ("Saint Martin summer"), the Portuguese celebrate it with ''jerupiga'' (a sweet liqueur wine) and roasted Portuguese [[chestnut]]s (''castanhas assadas''), and it is called ''Magusto''.

== Sports and games==
[[Football (soccer)|Football]] is the most popular and practised sport in Portugal. 
Football started to become well known in our country in the final decades of the 19th century, brought by Portuguese students who returned from England.
The first person responsible for its implementation would have been Guilherme Pinto Basto (according to some people, his brothers Eduardo and Frederico would have brought the first ball from England). It was he who had the initiative to organise an exhibition of the new game, which took place in October of 1888, and it was also him who organized the first football match in January of the following year. The match, played where today the ''Campo Pequeno'' bullring is located, involved opposing teams from Portugal and England. The Portuguese won the game 2-1. Consequently, football started attracting the attention of the high society, being distinguished by the Luso-British rivalry.
Later, the game spread, being practised in colleges and leading to the foundation of clubs all over the country. Until the end of the century, associations such as ''Clube Lisbonense'', ''Carcavelos'', ''Braço de Prata'', the ''Real Ginásio Clube Português'', the ''Estrela Futebol Clube'', the ''Futebol Académico'', the ''Campo de Ourique'', the Oporto Cricket, and the ''Sport Clube Vianense'' were founded to practise this sport or created sections for competing.
The first match, between Lisbon and Porto, took place in 1894, attended by King D. Carlos.
The ''Clube Internacional de Futebol'' (founded in 1902) was the first Portuguese team to play abroad defeating, in 1907, the ''Madrid Futebol Clube'' in the Spanish capital.
Currently, of the most important teams of the sport in Portugal, the oldest is the ''Boavista Futebol Clube'', which was founded in 1903. The ''Futebol Clube do Porto'', after an unsuccessful attempt in 1893, appeared in 1906, stimulated by José Monteiro da Costa, among others. The ''Sporting Clube de Portugal'' was founded in 1906 by the Viscount of Alvalade and his grandson José de Alvalade. ''Sport Lisboa e Benfica'', was born in 1908 from the fusion of the ''Sport Lisboa'' (founded in 1904) with the ''Grupo Sport Benfica''. They are all clubs that traditionally have several sports activities but they give great distinction to football, making use of teams of professional players, which frequently participate in European competitions.
In May 2006, the [[Portugal national football team|Portuguese national team]] was [[FIFA World Rankings|ranked 7th]] out of 205 countries by [[FIFA]]. The legendary [[Eusébio]] is still a symbol of Portuguese football. [[Luís Figo]] was voted 2001 Player of the Year by FIFA, after finishing 2nd in 2000. [[Manuel Rui Costa|Rui Costa]] and [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] are also noteworthy and [[Vítor Baía]] is the player in history with most titles won, including all European club cups. Moreover, [[José Mourinho]] is regarded as one of the most successful and well-paid football managers in football's history. The main domestic [[Football (soccer)|football]] competition is the [[Portuguese Liga|Superliga]] where the dominating teams are [[SL Benfica]], [[FC Porto]] and [[Sporting CP]]. Portugal hosted and nearly won [[EURO 2004]], getting defeated in the final by surprise winner [[Greece national football team|Greece]]. The Portuguese national team also reached the semi-finals of the FIFA World Cup twice, in 1966, when Eusebio was the top scorer, with 9 goals, and also in 2006. The year 2006 was the year that Portugal nearly won the [[FIFA]] [[World Cup]] tournament, ranking 4th overall after being defeated by [[France]] and [[Germany]]'s football teams. This was the first time since 1966 that the Potuguese football team had advanced to a such a high qualifying round in a World Cup tournament. The team was welcomed back proudly from its country. 

Other than football, many other professional and well organized sport competitions take place every season in Portugal, including [[basketball]], [[swimming]], [[athletics (track and field)|athletics]], [[tennis]], [[gymnastics]], [[futsal]], [[rink hockey]], [[team handball]], [[volleyball]], and [[Rugby union|rugby]] championships among the hundreds of [[sports]] played in this country. 

[[Cycling]], with [[Volta a Portugal]] being the most important race, is also popular. 

In [[rink hockey]] Portugal is the country with most world titles: 15 [[Rink Hockey World Championship|World Championships]] and 20 [[Rink Hockey European Championship|European Championships]], and in [[rugby sevens]] the Portuguese team has won many international trophies, having as of July 2006 five European Championship titles. 

[[Golf]] is also worth mentioning, since its greatest players play in the sunny region of the [[Algarve]] during the "Algarve Open". 

The [[Autódromo do Estoril|Autódromo Fernanda Pires da Silva]] in the [[Estoril]], near Lisbon, is the main Portuguese race track where many motorsport competitions are held, including the [[MotoGP|World Motorcycling Championship]] and [[A1 Grand Prix]]. 

[[Rallying]] (with the Rally of Portugal and Rally Madeira) and [[off-road]] (with the Baja Portugal 1000 and recently [[Dakar Rally|Lisboa-Dakar]]) events also have international recognition. 

[[Triathlon]] is also giving important steps thanks to the world cup leader [[Vanessa Fernandes]] and [[martial arts]] like [[judo]], which has brought many medals to Portugal.

The major Portuguese professional sports leagues and championships are:
*[[Portuguese Football Championship]] in [[football (soccer)|football]]
*[[Portuguese Futsal First Division]] in [[futsal]]
*[[Portuguese Basketball League]] in [[basketball]]
*[[Portuguese Rink Hockey Championship]] in [[rink hockey]]
*[[Portuguese Handball League]] in [[team handball|handball]]
*[[Portuguese Volleyball League A1]] in [[volleyball]]

The country has an ancient [[martial art]] known as "[[Jogo do Pau]]" (Portuguese Stick Fencing), used for self-protection and for duels between young men in disputes over young women. Having its origin in the [[Middle Ages]], Jogo do Pau uses wooden staves as a combat weapon. 

Other sports are the "Jogos Populares", a wide variety of traditional sports played for fun.
