{{Middle-earth elves}}
In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[legendarium]], an '''Elf''' is an individual member of one of the races that inhabit the lands of [[Arda]]. They appear in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', but their complex history is described in full only in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', edited and published after Tolkien's death. More details about them are given in the author's other writings edited and published since then, such as ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' and ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''. ''The History of Middle-earth'' also reveals their textual and conceptual history, as Tolkien had been writing about Elves long before ''The Hobbit'' was published. 

==Development==

===Early Writings and Juvinalia===

Humphrey Carpenter notes that traditional [[Fairy painting| Victorian dancing fairies]] and elves appear in much of Tolkien's early poetry,<ref name = "bolt1">{{ME-ref|bolt}}</ref><ref>Fimi, Dimitra.

''Working With English: Medieval and Modern Language, Literature and Drama''. Retrieved 11/01/08</ref> in part due to the influence of a production of J.M. Barrie's ''[[Peter Pan]]'' in [[Birmingham]] in 1910<ref name="Carpenter">{{ME-ref|Biography}}</ref> and his familiarity with the work of [[Catholic]] mystic poet, [[Francis Thompson]] <ref name="Carpenter" /> which he acquired in 1914.<ref name = "bolt1" />

As a philologist, Tolkien's interest in languages led him to invent several of his own as a pastime. In considering the nature of who might speak these languages, and what stories they might tell, Tolkien again turned to the concept of elves, according to Tolkiens biographer Humphrey Carpenter.<ref name="Carpenter"/>

===The Book of Lost Tales (c. 1917-1927)===

Dimitra Fimi observes that in the earliest forms of the stories which provide context for the Elvish languages,''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', Tolkien develops a theme that the diminutive fairy-like race of elves had once been a great and mighty people, and that as Men took over the world, these Elves had "diminished".<ref name = "bolt1" /><ref>{{ME-ref|bolt2}}</ref><ref name="Fimi"> Fimi, Dimitra. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2386/is_2_117/ai_n16676591 "Mad" Elves and "elusive beauty": some Celtic strands of Tolkien's mythology.] Folklore, Volume 117, Issue [[2 August]] [[2006]], pp. 156–170</ref> 

Tom Shippey claims these greater Elves are influenced by [[Elf|those in Northern European mythologies]],especially the god-like and human-sized ''[[Light elf|Ljósálfar]]'' of the Norse,<ref>{{cite book |last = Shippey |first = T.A. |authorlink = Tom Shippey |title = The Road to Middle-earth |publisher = HarperCollins Publishers |date=2005 [1982] |edition = 3rd ed. |isbn = 0-261-10275-3}}</ref> whereas Douglas A. Anderson suggests that they are derived from medieval works such as ''[[Sir Orfeo]]'', the Welsh [[Mabinogion]], [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] romances and the legends of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]].<ref name="Anderson1">Anderson, Douglas A. ''The Annotated Hobbit'' p. 120</ref> John Garth has also references the Tuatha Dé Danann in suggesting Tolkien was essentially rewriting Irish fairy traditions. <ref>Garth, John. ''Tolkien and the Great War'', p. 222</ref>

Dimitra Fimi has suggested that some of the stories Tolkien wrote as their 'legends' are directly influenced by [[Celtic mythology]].<ref name="Fimi"/>  For example, the "Flight of The Noldoli (later [[Noldor]])" is based on the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] and [[Lebor Gabála Érenn]], and their migratory nature comes from early Irish/Celtic history.<ref name="Fimi"/>

Terry Gunnell notes the name 'Inwe' (originally 'Ing', later '[[Ingwë]]'), given by Tolkien to the eldest of the elves and his clan<ref>J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien editor, ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Vol. V, p 171, ''The Lhammas''.</ref> is similar to the name found in Norse mythology as "[[Freyr|Ingwi-Freyr]]" (and Ingui-Frea in [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]]), a god who is given [[Álfheim]] (the elf-world) to rule as a gift. Terry Gunnell also claims that the relationship between beautiful ships and the Elves is reminiscent of [[Njörðr]] and [[Skíðblaðni]], Freyr's ship.<ref>http://www.hi.is/Apps/WebObjects/HI.woa/wa/dp?detail=1004509&name=nordals_en_greinar_og_erindi</ref>

In his Biography of Tolkien, Humphrey Carpenter says that these larger Elves are also inspired by Tolkien's [[Catholic]] theology — as representing the state of Men in Eden who have not yet "[[Fall of Man|fallen]]" — similar to humans but fairer and wiser, with greater spiritual powers, keener senses, and a closer empathy with nature. Tolkien wrote of them: 

{{cquote|
They are made by man in his own image and likeness; but freed from those limitations which he feels most to press upon him. They are immortal, and their will is directly effective for the achievement of imagination and desire.<ref name="Carpenter"/>
}}

Douglas Anderson shows that in ''The Book of Lost Tales'' that Tolkien includes both the more serious 'medieval' type of elves such as [[Fëanor]] and [[Turgon]] alongside the frivolous, [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] type of elves such as the Solosimpi and the early [[Lúthien|Tinúviel]] .<ref name="Anderson1" />

Alongside the idea of the greater Elves, Tolkien also developed the idea of children visiting Valinor the island-homeland of the Elves in their sleep. Elves would also visit children at night and comfort them if they had been chided or were upset. This theme, linking elves with children, was soon abandoned.<ref>J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien editor, ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Vol. 1, p 31, ''The Cottage of Lost Play''.</ref>

=== The Hobbit (c. 1930-1937)===

Along with ''Book of Lost Tales'', Douglas Anderson shows that in ''[[The Hobbit]]'', Tolkien again includes both the  more serious 'medieval' type of elves, such as [[Elrond]] and the Wood-elf king  alongside the frivolous type elves, such as those at [[Rivendell]] .<ref name="Anderson1" />

=== The Quenta Silmarilion (c. 1937) ===

In 1937, having had his manuscript for ''The Silmarillion'' rejected by a publisher who disparaged all the "eye-splitting Celtic names" that Tolkien had given his Elves, Tolkien denied the names had a Celtic origin:

{{cquote|Needless to say they are not Celtic! Neither are the tales. I do know Celtic things (many in their original languages Irish and Welsh), and feel for them a certain distaste: largely for their fundamental unreason. They have bright colour, but are like a broken stained glass window reassembled without design. They are in fact 'mad' as your reader says--but I don't believe I am.(Carpenter 1981, 26). }}

Dimitra Fimi proposes that these comments are a product of his Anglophilia rather than a commentary on the texts themselves or their actual influence on his writing, and cites evidence to this effect in her essay ''"Mad" Elves and "elusive beauty": some Celtic strands of Tolkien's mythology''.<ref name="Fimi"/>

=== The Lord of the Rings (c. 1937-1949)===

Terry Gunner notes that the titles of the Germanic gods Freyr and Freyja (lord and lady) are also given to Celeborn and Galadriel in the ''Lord of The Rings''.<ref>http://www.hi.is/Apps/WebObjects/HI.woa/wa/dp?detail=1004509&name=nordals_en_greinar_og_erindi</ref> According to Tom Shippey the diminishment theme, from Elf to "Fairy" resurfaces in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' in the dialogue of [[Galadriel]].<ref>T.A. Shippey: ''Tolkien, Author of the Century'' HarperCollins, 2000, p. 211</ref>

Writing in 1954, part way through proofing ''The  Lord of the Rings'' Tolkien claimed the [[Elvish language]] [[Sindarin]] has: {{cquote|a linguistic character very like (though not identical with) [[Welsh language|British-Welsh]] ... because it seems to fit the rather 'Celtic' type of legends and stories told of its speakers (Carpenter 1981, 26)}}.<ref name="letter_144">{{ME-ref|letters|#144}}</ref>

In the same letter, Tolkien goes on to say that the elves had very little in common with [[Elf#Elves_in_Norse_mythology|European Elves]] or [[Fairy|Fairies]], and that they really represent men with greater artistic ability, beauty and a longer life span. Tolkien also says that an Elven bloodline was the only real claim to 'nobility' that the Men of Middle-earth can have.<ref name="letter_144" />

Tolkien also wrote the elves of ''The Lord of the Rings'' as being primarily to blame for many of the ills of Middle-earth, having independently created the Three Rings in order to stop their domains in mortal-lands from 'fading' and attempting to prevent inevitable change and new growth.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.davidbrin.com/tolkienarticle1.html |title="We Hobbits are a Merry Folk: an incautious and heretical re-appraisal of J.R.R. Tolkien"|accessdaymonth=24 March |accessyear=2008}}</ref>

==History==
===Awakening===
{{main|Awakening of the Elves}}
The Elves awoke during the [[Years of the Trees]] in the [[First Age]] on the shores of Lake [[Cuiviénen]] under the starlit sky, as [[Middle-earth]] lay in darkness by then. There they were discovered by the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Vala]] [[Oromë]], who brought the tidings of their awakening to [[Valinor]]. 

''The Silmarillion'' states that [[Morgoth|Melkor]], the Dark Lord, had already captured some wandering Elves, and twisted and mutilated them until they became the [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]]. However, Tolkien ultimately became uncomfortable with this Elvish origin, and devised different theories about the [[Orc (Middle-earth)#The origin of Orcs|origin of Orcs]].<ref name="morgoth's ring1">{{me-ref|mr|"Myths Transformed"}}</ref>

===Sundering===
{{main|Sundering of the Elves}}
[[Image:Sundering of the Elves.png||thumb|400px|The Sundering of the Elves as perceived after the Exile of the Noldor]]
The Valar decided to summon the Elves to Valinor rather than leaving them dwelling in place where they were first awakened, near the Cuiviénen lake in the eastern extremity of Middle-earth. They sent Oromë, who took [[Ingwë]], [[Finwë]] and [[Elwë]] as ambassadors to Valinor.

Returning to Middle-earth, Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë convinced a great host to take the journey to Valinor. Not all Elves accepted the summons though, and those who did not became known as the '''[[Avari]]''', ''The Unwilling''.

The others were called '''Eldar''', ''the People of the Stars'' by Oromë, and they took Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë as their leaders, and became respectively the [[Vanyar]], [[Noldor]] and [[Teleri]]. On their journey, some of the Teleri feared the [[Misty Mountains]] and dared not cross them. They turned back and stayed in the vales of the [[Anduin]], and became the [[Nandor (Middle-earth)|Nandor]]; these were led by Lenwë.

Oromë led the others over the Misty Mountains and [[Ered Lindon]] into [[Beleriand]]. There Elwë became lost, and the Teleri stayed behind looking for him. The Vanyar and the Noldor moved onto a floating island that was moved by [[Ulmo]] to Valinor. 

After years, Ulmo returned to Beleriand to seek out the remaining Teleri. As Elwë had not yet been found, a great part of the Teleri took his brother [[Olwë]] as their leader and were ferried to Valinor. Some Teleri stayed behind though, still looking for Elwë, and others stayed on the shores, being called by [[Ossë]]. They took [[Círdan]] as their leader and became the '''[[Falathrim]]'''. All Teleri who stayed in Beleriand later became known as the '''[[Sindar]]'''.

===Exile===
{{main|Exiles (Middle-earth)}}
In Valinor, Fëanor, son of Finwë, and the greatest of the Noldor, created the [[Silmaril]]s in which he stored a part of the light of the [[Two Trees]] that were lighting Valinor. After three ages in the Halls of Mandos, Melkor was released. He spread his evil, and eventually killed Finwë and stole the Silmarils. Fëanor then named him ''Morgoth'' ([[Quenya|Q]]. ''The Black Enemy''). Fëanor and his seven [[sons of Fëanor|sons]] then [[Oath of Fëanor|swore]] to take the Silmarils back, and led a large army of the Noldor to Beleriand.

===Wars of Beleriand===
{{main|War of Beleriand}}
In Beleriand, Elwë was eventually found, and married [[Melian]] the [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maia]]. He became the overlord of Beleriand, naming himself Thingol ([[Sindarin|S]]. ''Grey-cloak''). After the [[First Battle of Beleriand]], during the first rising of the Moon, the Noldor arrived in Beleriand. They laid a [[Siege of Angband|siege]] around [[Angband (Middle-earth)|Angband]] (Morgoth's fortress), but were eventually defeated.

Then [[Eärendil the Mariner]], a [[half-elven|half-elf]] from the [[House of Finwë]], sailed to Valinor to ask the Valar for help. Then the Ban of the Noldor was lifted, and the Valar started the [[War of Wrath]], in which Morgoth was finally overcome.

===Second and Third Age===
After the War of Wrath, the Valar tried to summon the Elves back to Valinor. Many complied, but some stayed. During the [[Second Age]] they founded the Realms of [[Lindon]], [[Eregion]] and [[Mirkwood]]. [[Sauron]], Morgoth’s former servant, made war upon them, but with the aid of the [[Númenóreans]] they defeated him.

During the Second and [[Third Age]] they held some protected realms with the aid of the [[Rings of Power]], but after the [[War of the Ring]] they waned further, and most Elves left Middle-earth for Valinor. Tolkien's published writings give somewhat contradictory hints as to what happened to the Elves of Middle-earth after the [[One Ring]] was destroyed at the end of the [[Third Age]].  

After the destruction of the One Ring, the power of the [[Three Rings]] of the Elves would also end and the Age of Men would begin. Elves that remained in Middle-earth were doomed to a slow decline until, in the words of [[Galadriel]], they faded and became a "rustic folk of dell and cave," and were greatly diminished from their ancient power and nobility. While the power of the remaining [[Noldor]] would be immediately lessened, the "fading" of all Elvenkind was a phenomenon that would play out over hundreds and even thousands of years;  until, in fact, our own times, when occasional glimpses of rustic Elves would fuel our folktales and fantasies.

There are many references in ''The Lord of the Rings'' to the continued existence of Elves in Middle-earth during the early years of the [[Fourth Age]]. [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], the sons of Elrond, do not accompany their father when the White Ship bearing the [[Ring-bearer]] and the chief Noldorin leaders sails from the [[Grey Havens]] to [[Valinor]];  they are said to have remained in Lindon for a time. Celeborn is said (in Appendix A) to have added most of southern Mirkwood to the realm of [[Lothlórien|Lórien]] at the end of the Third Age, but elsewhere Tolkien wrote that Celeborn dwelt for a while in Lindon before at last leaving Middle-earth for Valinor.

Tolkien also wrote that Elves moved to Ithilien during King [[Elessar]]'s reign, and assisted in the rebuilding of Gondor. They primarily resided in southern Ithilien, along the shores of the Anduin. It is also implied that Elves continued to dwell at the Grey Havens, at least for a certain period.  Tolkien states that [[Círdan]] did not sail with [[Elrond]], Galadriel, and the others at the end of ''The Lord of the Rings'', and [[Sam Gamgee]] sailed from the Havens decades afterwards, so it would seem that at least some Elves remained in [[Mithlond]] at that time.  Círdan would supposedly leave on the last ship ever to leave the havens. [[Legolas]] also sailed to Valinor after Elessar's death, and although the reference to this in ''The Lord of the Rings'' states that it was Legolas himself that built the ship, it seems unlikely that any Wood-Elf from Mirkwood could have done so without the assistance of Círdan's folk, whom Tolkien elsewhere said were the only Elves remaining at the end of the Third Age with the skill to build the great ships that sailed from Middle-earth to the Blessed Realm.

In "The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen" that is found in Appendix A, Tolkien depicts a Middle-earth where most Elves have already left. The majority of those who remained lived in Mirkwood, while a much smaller population was in Lindon. Aragorn speaks of the empty garden of Elrond in Rivendell. Most strikingly, after Elessar's voluntary death, [[Arwen]] flees to a Lórien that is depicted as wholly abandoned, and gives up her own spirit in its sad and silent confines.

==Life cycle==
{{Cleanup-section|date=June 2006}}
As told in ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' and in Tolkien's ''[[The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien|Letters]]'', Elves had a different life cycle than Men. Most of the following information strictly refers only to the Eldar, as found in his essay '''''Laws and Customs among the Eldar''''', found in ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]''.

===Early life===
Elves are born about one year from their [[conception]]. The day of their conception is celebrated, not the actual [[birthday]] itself. Their minds develop quicker than their bodies; by their first year, they can speak, walk and even dance, and their quicker onset of mental maturity makes young Elves seem, to Men, older than they really are. Physical [[puberty]] comes in around their fiftieth to one hundredth year (by age fifty they reach their adult height), and by their first hundred years of life outside the womb all Elves are fully grown. Elven bodies eventually stop ageing physically, while human bodies do not.<ref name="laws">{{me-ref|mr|"Laws and Customs among the Eldar"}}</ref>

===Sexuality, marriage, and parenthood===

Elves marry freely and for love early in life. [[Monogamy]] is practised and [[adultery]] is unthinkable; they only marry once (Finwë, first High King of the Noldor, was an exception, as he remarried after his first wife died).<ref name="laws"/> 

Spouses can choose each other even long before they are married, thus becoming betrothed.  The betrothal is subject to parental approval unless the parties are of age and intend to marry soon, at which point the betrothal is announced at a meeting of the two houses.  They exchange rings and the betrothal lasts at least a year, and is revocable by the return of the rings; however, it is rarely broken. After their formal betrothal, the couple appoint a date, at least a year later, for the wedding.<ref name="laws"/>

Marriage is celebrated at a feast of the two houses. They give back their betrothal rings and receive others worn on their index fingers. The bride’s mother gives the groom a jewel to be worn. Only the words exchanged by the bride and groom (including the speaking of the name of [[Eru Ilúvatar]]) and the consummation are required for marriage.<ref name="laws"/>

The Elves view the sexual act as extremely special and intimate, for it leads to the conception and birth of children. [[extra-marital sex|Extra-marital]] and [[premarital sex]] are unthinkable, adultery is also unheard of and fidelity between spouses is absolute. Yet a sundering during pregnancy or during the early years of parenthood (caused by war, for example) is so grievous to the couple that they prefer to have children in peaceful times. Living Elves cannot be raped or forced to have sex; before that they will lose the will to endure and go to Mandos.<ref name="laws"/>

Elves have few children, as a rule (Fëanor and [[Nerdanel]] were an exception, conceiving seven sons), and there are relatively sizeable intervals between each child (but see below for notes on Elvish birth rates in Middle-earth versus in Aman). They are soon preoccupied with other pleasures; their [[libido]] wanes and they focus their interests elsewhere, like the arts. Nonetheless, they take great delight in the union of love, and they cherish the days of bearing and raising children as the happiest days of their lives.<ref name="laws"/>

There seems to only be one known example of extreme marital strife in Tolkien's mythology, that of [[Eöl]] and [[Aredhel]], in which the latter actually left the former without his knowledge, resulting in Eöl ultimately killing her. However, this marriage was far from typical of the Elves.

===Daily life===
The Elves, particularly the Noldor, preoccupy themselves with various things, such as smithwork, sculpture, music and other arts, and of course, what to eat. Males and females can do almost everything equally; however, the females often specialize in the arts of healing while the men go to war. This is because they believe that taking life interferes with the ability to preserve life. However, Elves are not stuck in rigid roles; females can defend themselves at need as well as males, and many males are skilled healers as well, such as [[Elrond]].<ref name="laws"/>

===Later life===
Eventually, if they do not die in battle or from some other cause, the Elves of Middle-earth grow weary of it and desire to go to Valinor, where the Valar originally sheltered their kind. Those who wish to leave for the Undying Lands go by boats provided at the [[Grey Havens]], where [[Círdan]] the Shipwright dwells with his folk.

==="The third cycle of life," ageing, and facial hair===
Despite Tolkien's statements in ''The Hobbit'' that Elves (and Hobbits) have no beards, Círdan in fact has a beard, which appears to be an anomaly and a simple oversight. However, Tolkien later devised at least  three "cycles of life" for Elves around 1960; Círdan had a beard because he was in his third cycle of life. ([[Mahtan]], Nerdanel's father, had a beard in his second cycle of life, a rare phenomenon.)  It is unclear what these cycles exactly are, since Tolkien left no notes further explaining this. Apparently, beards were the only sign of further natural physical ageing beyond maturity.

Nevertheless, Tolkien may have ultimately changed his mind about whether Elves had facial hair. As Christopher Tolkien states in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', his father wrote in December 1972 or later that the Elvish strain in Men, such as [[Aragorn]], was "''observable in the beardlessness of those who were so descended''", since "''it was a characteristic of all Elves to be beardless''".<ref>{{Me-ref|ut}}</ref> This would seemingly contradict the information above.

Elves sometimes appear to age under great stress. Círdan appeared to be aged himself, since he is described as looking old, save for the stars in his eyes; this may be due to all the sorrows he had seen and lived through since the First Age. Also, the people of [[Gwindor]] of [[Nargothrond]] had trouble recognizing him after his time as a prisoner of Morgoth.

===Death===
Elves are naturally immortal. In addition to their immortality, and (at least due to their extended knowledge of herbs and medicines) they can recover from wounds which would normally kill a mortal Man. However, Elves can be slain, or die of grief and weariness. In this way they are not truly immortal, at least not in a literal sense, but have indefinite lifespans (they will not die of age, but can be killed in battle). Even so, this idea is collectively called ''immortality''.

Elves who die or are killed go to the Halls of Mandos in Valinor. After a certain period of time and rest that serves as "cleansing", their spirits (''[[Fëa and hröa|fëa]]'') are clothed in bodies (''[[Fëa and hröa|hröa]]'') identical to their old ones.<ref name="converse">{{ME-ref|MR|''The Converse of Manwë and Eru'', p. 361–4}}</ref> They almost never go back to Middle-earth, however. The only Elf known to have done so was [[Glorfindel]]. A rare and more unusual example of an Elf coming back from the Halls of Mandos can be read in the tale of Beren and Lúthien, as [[Lúthien]] was the other Elf to be sent back to Middle-earth — as a mortal, however.

Eventually, their immortal spirits (''fëa'') will overwhelm and consume their bodies (''hröa''), rendering them "bodiless", whether they opt to go to Valinor or remain in Middle-earth. At the end of the world, all Elves will have become invisible to mortal eyes, except to those to whom they wish to manifest themselves.<ref name="laws"/> Tolkien called the Elves of Middle-earth who had undergone this process "Lingerers"<ref name="laws"/>, and the process may be thought of as a fourth and final cycle of Elven life.

The lives of Elves only endure as the world endures.<ref name="laws"/> It is said in the Second Prophecy of [[Mandos]] that at the end of time the Elves will join the other [[Children of Ilúvatar]] in singing the Second Music of the [[Ainu (Middle-earth)|Ainur]].<ref>{{ME-ref|sil}}</ref>However it is disputable whether the Prophecy is canon, and the published [[Silmarillion]] states that only Men shall participate in the Second Music, and that the ultimate fate of the Elves is unknown.

==Names and naming conventions==
{{see|Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings}}
In ''The Lord of the Rings'' Tolkien pretends to be merely the translator of Bilbo and Frodo's memoirs, collectively known as the "[[Red Book of Westmarch]]". He says that those names and terms  in the work (as well in the earlier ''The Hobbit'') that appear in [[English language|English]] are meant to be his purported translations from the [[Common Speech]].<ref>{{ME-ref|rotk}}, Appendix F.</ref> 

Tolkien repeatedly expressed his misgivings concerning the name "[[elf]]" and its "associations of a kind that I should particularly desire not to be present [...] e.g. those of [[Michael Drayton|Drayton]] or of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''", for the purpose of [[translations of The Lord of the Rings|translations]] stating his preference that  "the oldest available form of the name to be used, and leave it to acquire its own associations for readers of my tale".<ref>''[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings]]'', s.v. "Elven-smiths".</ref> He wanted to avoid the [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] notions of "[[fairies]]" or mischievous imps associated with the word and was aiming at the more elevated notions of beings  "supposed to possess formidable magical powers in early [[Germanic mythology|Teutonic mythology]]" ([[OED]] viz. the [[Old English]] ''ælf'', from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*albo-z'').

The Elves are also called the "Firstborn" ([[Quenya|Q]]. ''Minnónar'') or the "Elder Kindred" (as opposed to [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], the Secondborn) as they were "[[Awakening of the Elves|awakened]]" before Men by [[Eru Ilúvatar]] ([[God]]). The Elves named themselves ''Quendi'' ("the Speakers"), in honour of the fact that, when they were created, they were the only living beings able to speak. The [[Dúnedain]] called them ''Nimîr'' ("the Beautiful"), while their usual name in [[Sindarin]] was ''Eledhrim''.<ref name="QuendiandEldar1">{{ME-ref|WotJ|''Quendi and Eldar''}}</ref> 

In other writings, part of ''The History of Middle-earth'', Tolkien details Elvish naming conventions. The Quenya word for "name" was ''essë''. An Elf of Valinor was typically given one name (''ataressë'') at birth by the father. It usually reflected either the name of the father or mother, indicating the person's descent, to which later some distinguishing prefix could be added. As the Elf grew older, they received a second name (''amilessë''), given by the mother. This name was extremely important and reflected personality, skills, or fate, sometimes being 'prophetic'. 

The ''epessë'' or the "after-name" is the third type. It was given later in life, not necessarily by kin, as a title of admiration and honour. In some circumstances, yet another name was chosen by the Elf themselves, called ''kilmessë'' meaning "self-name".

The "true names" remained the first two, though an Elf could be referred to by any of these. Mother-names were usually not used by those who did not know the Elf well. In later history and song any of the four could become the one generally used and recognized.

After their Exile to Middle-earth and adoption of [[Sindarin]] as the daily speech, most of the Noldor also chose for themselves a name that fitted the style of that language, translating or altering one of their [[Quenya]] names.

A [[patronymic]] surname is also used  — the father's name with the suffix "-ion" added. Thus, [[Gildor Inglorion]] is "''Gildor, son of Inglor''".

Several examples include:

*'''[[Galadriel]]''' is the Sindarin translation of Alatáriel, the Telerin Quenya ''epessë'' originally given to her by [[Celeborn]], which means "Maiden Crowned by a Radiant Garland". Her father-name is Artanis (noble woman) and her mother-name is Nerwen (man-maiden).

*'''[[Maedhros]]''', the oldest son of [[Fëanor]], was called ''Russandol'' (copper-top) by his brothers: He had earned this ''epessë'' because of his ruddy hair. His father-name had been ''Nelyafinwë'' (Finwë the third: Fëanor's own father-name had been (Curu) Finwë), and his mother-name ''Maitimo'' (well-shaped one). ''Maedhros'' is a rendering into Sindarin of parts of his mother-name and ''epessë''.

*'''[[Finrod Felagund|Finrod]]''' is usually referred to as ''Felagund'' (hewer of caves), a name the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] had given to him (originally ''Felakgundu'') because of his dwellings at [[Nargothrond]]. Finrod adopted the name, and made it a title of honour.

*'''[[Círdan]]''' (Shipwright) is the ''epessë'' of a [[Teleri]]n Elf who remained in [[Beleriand]], and later [[Lindon]], until the end of the [[Third Age]]. His original name was only rarely remembered in traditions as ''Nōwē'', and he was referred to always as Círdan, a title which had been given to him as Lord of the [[Falas]].

==Elvish languages== 
{{main|Elvish languages}}

Tolkien created many languages for Elves. His interest was primarily [[philology|philological]], and he said his stories grew out of his languages. Indeed, the languages were the first thing Tolkien ever created for his mythos, starting with what he originally called "Qenya", the first primitive form of Elvish. This was later called [[Quenya]] (High-elven) and, along with [[Sindarin]] (Grey-elven), is one of the two most complete of Tolkien's languages. In addition to these two he also created several other (partially derived) languages.

Elves are also credited with creating the [[Tengwar]] (by [[Fëanor]]) and [[Cirth]] ([[Daeron]]) runic scripts.

The 1979 [[Rankin Bass]] animated version of ''The Hobbit'', with character designs by Lester Abrams, features Elves as green-skinned warriors with slightly [[Austrians|Austrian]]-[[German language|German]] accents. 

In ''[[MERP|Middle-earth Role Playing]]'' ([[Iron Crown Enterprises]], 1986), three tribes of elves are presented as [[player character]] race options, the Silvan, Sinda and Noldo — each receiving statistic bonuses (ranging from 5 to 15) to all attributes apart from Strength, with the Noldo receiving the highest accumulative bonuses of any racial type in the game. All three tribes are statistically immune to disease (+100% chance of resistance), and must be given 'Presence' as the highest randomly generated statistic. Elven characters also receive significant skill bonuses with missile weapons (such as a bow and arrow) and stealth skills (such as hiding).

All three elven tribes (Silvan, Noldor, Sindar) depicted in [[Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game]] ([[Decipher, Inc.]], 2001) have varying (one or two points) statistic bonuses to Bearing, Perception and Nimbleness, with the Noldor also receiving a bonus to Wits and the Sindar to Vitality, giving both of these the highest accumulative bonuses available to Player Characters. The system of skills, feats and flaws further outlines racial and cultural characteristics, bonuses being given to the Noldor in Lore and "Resisting the Shadow", to the Silvan elves for various wood-craft skills, and the Sindar to musical performance. All elves have the ability to enchant objects, and receive bonuses in any test regarding magic.

In the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game]]'' ([[Games Workshop]], 2001), Elves have similar statistics to similarly armed Men, except for much higher scores for their Fighting and Courage attributes.<ref>{{cite web | title = Profiles of Middle-earth | work = Rules Summary | publisher = Games Workshop | date =  | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/legionsofmiddleearth/reference/1/ | accessdate = 2007-07-03 }}</ref> On average, Elven wargear (armour and weapons) give twice the advantage of weapons made by Men.
