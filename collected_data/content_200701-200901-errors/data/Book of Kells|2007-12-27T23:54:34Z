The '''Book of Kells''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: ''Leabhar Cheanannais'') (Dublin, Trinity College Library, MS A. I. (58), less widely known as the '''Book of Columba''') is an ornately illustrated [[manuscript]], produced by [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic]] [[monk]]s around AD 800 in the style known as [[Insular art]]. 

The Book of Kells is an illuminated manuscript that has survived from the [[Middle Ages]] and has been described as the zenith of [[Calligraphy#Western calligraphy|Western calligraphy]] and illumination. It contains the [[gospel|four gospels]] of the [[Bible]] in [[Latin]], along with prefatory and explanatory matter decorated with numerous colourful illustrations and illuminations. Today it is on permanent display at the [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] Library in Dublin, Ireland.

==History==
===Origin===
[[Image:LindisfarneFol27rIncipitMatt.jpg|thumb|200px|Folio 27r from the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] contains the incipit '''Liber generationis''' of the [[Gospel of Matthew]]. Compare this page with the corresponding page from the Book of Kells (see [[:Image:KellsFol029rIncipitMatthew.jpg|here]]), especially the form of the "Lib" monogram.]]

The Book of Kells is the high point of a group of manuscripts in what is known as the [[Insular art|Insular style]] produced from the late 6th through the early 9th centuries in [[monastery|monasteries]] in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and northern [[England]] and in continental monasteries with Irish or English foundations. These manuscripts include the [[Cathach of St. Columba]], the [[Ambrosiana Orosius]], a [[Durham Cathedral Library A. II. 10. Gospel Book Fragment|fragmentary gospel]] in the Durham cathedral library (all from the early 7th century), and the [[Book of Durrow]] (from the second half of the 7th century). From the early 8th century come the [[Durham Gospels]], the [[Echternach Gospels]], the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] (see illustration at right), and the [[Lichfield Gospels]]. The [[St. Gall Gospel Book]] and the [[Macregal Gospels]] come from the late 8th century. The [[Book of Armagh]] (dated to 807–809), the [[Turin Gospel Book Fragment]], the [[Leiden Priscian]], the [[St. Gall Priscian]] and the [[Macdurnan Gospel]] all date from the early 9th century. Scholars place these manuscripts together based on similarities in artistic style, script, and textual traditions. The fully developed style of the ornamentation of the Book of Kells places it late in this series, either from the late eighth or early ninth century. The Book of Kells follows many of the iconographic and stylistic traditions found in these earlier manuscripts. For example, the form of the decorated letters found in the [[incipit]] pages for the Gospels is surprisingly consistent in Insular Gospels. Compare, for example, the incipit pages of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] [[:Image:LindisfarneFol27rIncipitMatt.jpg|in the Lindisfarne Gospels]] and [[:Image:KellsFol029rIncipitMatthew.gif|in the Book of Kells]] both of which feature intricate decorative knotwork inside the outlines formed by the enlarged initial letters of the text. (For a more complete list of related manuscripts see: [[List of Hiberno-Saxon illustrated manuscripts]].)

The name "Book of Kells" is derived from the [[Abbey of Kells]] in [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]], [[County Meath]] in Ireland, where it was kept for much of the medieval period. The date and place of production of the manuscript has been the subject of considerable debate. Traditionally, the book was thought to have been created in the time of [[St Columba|Columba]] (also known as St Columcille), possibly even as the work of his own hands. However, it is now generally accepted that this tradition is false based on [[paleography|palaeographic]] grounds: the style of script in which the book is written did not develop until well after Columba's death, making it impossible for him to have written it.<ref name="CE">{{ws|"[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Book of Kells|Book of Kells]]" in the 1913 ''Catholic Encyclopedia''}}</ref> Evidence shows the Book of Kells was written around the year 800 AD.<ref>{{cite web

The manuscript was never finished. There are at least five competing theories about the manuscript's place of origin and time of completion. First, the book may have been created entirely at [[Iona Abbey|Iona]], then brought to Kells and never finished. Second, the book may have been begun at Iona and continued at Kells, but never finished. Third, the manuscript may have been produced entirely in the [[scriptorium]] at Kells. Fourth, it may have been produced in the north of [[England]], perhaps at [[Lindisfarne]], then brought to Iona and from there to Kells. Finally, it may have been the product of an unknown monastery in Scotland. Although the question of the exact location of the book's production will probably never be answered conclusively, the second theory, that it was begun at Iona and finished at Kells, is currently the most widely accepted. Regardless of which theory is true, it is certain that the Book of Kells was produced by Columban monks closely associated with the community at Iona.

===Medieval period===
<!--Hiberno-English spelling-->

The evidence for an eleventh century presence of the book in Kells consists of an entry in the [[Annals of Ulster]] for 1009.  This entry records that "the great Gospel of Columkille, the chief relic of the Western World, was wickedly stolen during the night from the western sacristy of the great stone church at Cenannas on account of its wrought shrine". Cenannas is the [[Irish language|Irish]] name for Kells.  The manuscript was recovered a few months later - minus its golden and bejewelled cover - "under a [[sod]]". It is generally assumed that the "great Gospel of Columkille" is the Book of Kells.  If this is correct, then the book was in Kells by 1009, and been there long enough for thieves to learn of its presence.  The force of ripping the manuscript free from its cover may account for the [[Bookbinding|folio]]s missing from the beginning and end of the Book of Kells. 

Regardless, the book was certainly at Kells in the 12th century, when land [[charter]]s pertaining to the Abbey of Kells were copied into some of the book's blank pages. The copying of charters into important books such as the Book of Kells was a wide-spread mediaeval practice, which gives us indisputable evidence about the location of the book at the time the charters were written into it.

The Abbey of Kells was dissolved due to the ecclesiastical reforms of the 12th century. The abbey church was converted to a parish church in which the Book of Kells remained.

[[Image:KellsFol027v4Evang.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Folio 27v contains the four evangelist symbols. (Clockwise from top left: man, lion, eagle and ox)]]

====Book of Kildare====
The 12th century writer, [[Gerald of Wales]], in his ''Topographia Hibernica'', described, in a famous passage, seeing a great Gospel Book in [[Kildare]] which many have since assumed was the Book of Kells.<ref name="CE2">{{ws|"[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Kildare and Leighlin|Kildare and Leighlin]]" in the 1913 ''Catholic Encyclopedia''}}</ref> The description certainly matches Kells:

:"This book contains the harmony of the [[Four Evangelists]] according to [[Jerome]], where for almost every page there are different designs, distinguished by varied colours. Here you may see the face of majesty, divinely drawn, here the mystic symbols of the Evangelists, each with wings, now six, now four, now two; here the eagle, there the calf, here the man and there the lion, and other forms almost infinite. Look at them superficially with the ordinary glance, and you would think it is an erasure, and not tracery. Fine craftsmanship is all about you, but you might not notice it. Look more keenly at it and you will penetrate to the very shrine of art. You will make out intricacies, so delicate and so subtle, so full of knots and links, with colours so fresh and vivid, that you might say that all this was the work of an [[angel]], and not of a man."

Since Gerald claims to have seen this book in Kildare, he may have seen another, now lost, book equal in quality to the Book of Kells, or he may have misstated his location.

===Modern period===
The Book of Kells remained in Kells until 1654. In that year [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell's]] cavalry was quartered in the church at Kells and the governor of the town sent the book to [[Dublin]] for safe keeping. The book was presented to [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]] in Dublin in 1661 by [[Henry Jones]], who was to become [[bishop of Meath]] after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]]. The book has remained at Trinity College since the 17th century, except for brief loans to other libraries and museums. It has been displayed to the public in the Old Library at Trinity since the 19th century.

In the 16th century, the chapter numbers of the Gospels according to the division created by the 13th century [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Stephen Langton]] were written in the margins of the pages in [[roman numerals]] by [[Gerald Plunkett]] of Dublin. In 1621 the folios were numbered by the [[bishop-elect]] of Meath, [[James Ussher]]. In 1849 [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]] were invited to sign the book. They in fact signed a modern flyleaf which was erroneously believed to have been one of the original folios. The page which they signed was removed when the book was rebound in 1953.

Over the centuries the book has been [[Book binding|rebound]] several times. During an 18th century rebinding, the pages were rather unsympathetically cropped, with small parts of some illustrations being lost. The book was also rebound in 1895, but that rebinding broke down quickly. By the late 1920s several folios were being kept loose under a separate cover. In 1953, the work was bound in four volumes by Roger Powell, who also gently stretched several of the pages, which had developed bulges.

In 2000, the volume containing the [[Gospel of Mark]] was sent to [[Canberra]], [[Australia]] for an exhibition of illuminated manuscripts. This was only the fourth time the Book of Kells had been sent abroad for exhibition. Unfortunately, the volume suffered what has been called "minor pigment damage" while en route to Canberra. It is thought that the vibrations from the [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aeroplane]]'s engines during the long flight may have caused the damage.

===Reproductions===
[[Image:BookKells.jpg|thumb|250px|Folio 183r from the 1990 facsimile of the Book of Kells contains the text "Erat autem hora tercia" ("now it was the third hour").]]

In 1951, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] publisher, Urs Graf-verlag Bern, produced a [[facsimile]]. The majority of the pages were reproduced in black and white [[photograph]]s. There were, however, forty-eight pages reproduced in colour, including all of the full page decorations.

In 1974, [[Thames and Hudson]], under licence from the Board of Trinity College Dublin, produced a facsimile edition of all the full page illustrations in the manuscript and a representative section of the ornamentation of the text pages. Also included are some enlarged details of the illustrations. These are all done in full colour. The photography was done by John Kennedy, Green Studio, Dublin.

In 1979, another Swiss publisher, Faksimile verlag Luzern, requested permission to produce a full colour facsimile of the book. Permission was initially denied because Trinity College officials felt that the risk of damage to the book was too high. In 1986, after developing a process which used gentle suction to straighten a page so that it could be photographed without touching it, the publisher was given permission to produce a facsimile edition. After each page was photographed, a single page facsimile was prepared and the colours were carefully compared to the original and adjustments were made where necessary. The facsimile was published in 1990 in two volumes, the facsimile and a volume of commentary by prominent scholars. One copy is held by the [[Anglican]] Church in Kells, on the site of the original monastery.

==Description==
The Book of Kells contains the four gospels of the [[Christianity|Christian]] scriptures written in black, red, purple, and yellow ink in an [[insular majuscule]] script, preceded by prefaces, summaries, and concordances of gospel passages. Today it consists of 340 [[vellum]] leaves, called folios. The majority of the folios are part of larger sheets, called bifolios, which are folded in half to form two folios. The bifolios are nested inside of each other and sewn together to form gatherings called quires. On occasion, a folio is not part of a bifolio, but is instead a single sheet inserted within a quire.

It is believed that some 30 folios have been lost. (When the book was examined by Ussher in 1621 he counted 344 folios.) The extant folios are gathered into 38 [[Units of paper quantity#Quire|quires]]. There are between four and twelve folios per quire (two to six bifolios). Ten folios per quire is common. Some folios are single sheets. The important decorated pages often occurred on single sheets. The folios had lines drawn for the text, sometimes on both sides, after the bifolia were folded. Prick marks and guide lines can still be seen on some pages. The vellum is of high quality, although the folios have an uneven thickness, with some being almost leather, while others are so thin as to be almost translucent. The book's current dimensions are 330 by 250 [[millimetre|mm]]. Originally the folios were not of standard size, but they were cropped to the current standard size during an 18th century rebinding. The text area is approximately 250 by 170 mm. Each text page has 16 to 18 lines of text. The manuscript is in remarkably good condition considering its great age, though many pages have suffered some damage to the delicate artwork due to rubbing etc. The book must have been the product of a major scriptorium over several years, but was apparently never finished, the projected decoration of some of the pages appearing only in outline.

===Contents===
The book, as it exists now, contains preliminary matter, the complete text of the Gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], and the [[Gospel of John]] through John 17:13. The remainder of John and an unknown amount of the preliminary matter is missing and was perhaps lost when the book was stolen in the early 11th century. The extant preliminary matter consists of two fragments of lists of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] names contained in the gospels, the ''[[Breves causae]]'' and the ''[[Argumenta]]'' of the four gospels, and the [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebian]] [[Ammonian Sections|canon tables]]. It is probable that, like the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Books of Durrow and Armagh, part of the lost preliminary material included the letter of [[Jerome]] to [[Pope Damasus I]] known as ''[[Novum opus]]'', in which Jerome explains the purpose of his translation. It is also possible, though less likely, that the lost material included the letter of Eusebius to Carpianus, in which he explains the use of the canon tables. (Of all the insular gospels, only Lindisfarne contains this letter.)

There are two fragments of the lists of Hebrew names; one on the recto of the first surviving folio and one on folio 26, which is currently inserted at the end of the prefatory matter for John. The first list fragment contains the end of the list for the Gospel of Matthew. The missing names from Matthew would require an additional two folios. The second list fragment, on folio 26, contains about a fourth of the list for Luke. The list for Luke would require an additional three folios. The structure of the quire in which folio 26 occurs is such that it is unlikely that there are three folios missing between folios 26 and 27, so that it is almost certain that folio 26 is not now in its original location. There is no trace of the lists for Mark and John.

[[Image:KellsFol005rEusebianCanonTable.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Folio 5r contains a page of the Eusebian Canon Tables.]]

The first list fragment is followed by the canon tables of [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] of [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]]. These tables, which predate the text of the Vulgate, were developed to cross reference the gospels. Eusebius divided the Gospel into chapters and then created tables which allowed readers to find where a given episode in the life of Christ was located in each of the Gospels. The canon tables were traditionally included in the prefatory material in most mediaeval copies of the Vulgate text of the Gospels. The tables in the Book of Kells, however, are almost unusable because the scribe condensed the tables into in such a way as to make them confused. In addition, the corresponding chapter numbers were never inserted into the margins of the text, making it impossible to find the sections to which the canon tables refer. The reason these chapter numbers were never inserted is uncertain. It may have been planned to insert them when the decoration was completed, but since the decoration was never completed, they were never inserted. It also may be that it was decided to leave them out so as not to mar the appearance of pages.

[[Image:KellsFol019vBrevCausLuke.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Folio 19 contains the beginning of the ''Breves causae'' of Luke.]]

The ''Breves causae'' and the ''Argumenta'' belong to a pre-Vulgate tradition of manuscripts. The ''Breves causae'' are summaries of the [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin translations]] of the Gospels. They are divided into numbered chapters. These chapter numbers, like the numbers for the canon tables, are also not used on the text pages of the gospels. However, it is unlikely that these numbers would have been used, even if the manuscript had been completed, because the chapter numbers corresponded to old Latin translations and would have been difficult to harmonise with the Vulgate text. The ''Argumenta'' are collections of legends about the Evangelists. The ''Breves causae'' and ''Argumenta'' are arranged in a strange order: first come the ''Breves causae'' and ''Argumenta'' for Matthew, followed by the ''Breves'' and ''Argumenta'' for Mark, then, quite oddly, come the ''Argumenta'' of Luke and John, followed by the ''Breves causae'' of Luke and John. This anomalous order is the same as is found in the Book of Durrow, although the out of place ''Breves causae'' of Luke and John are placed at the end of the manuscript in Durrow, while the rest of the preliminaries are at the beginning. In other insular manuscripts, such as the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]], the [[Book of Armagh]], and the [[Echternach Gospels]], each Gospel is treated as separate work and has its preliminaries immediately preceding it. The slavish repetition in Kells of the order of the ''Breves causae'' and ''Argumenta'' found in Durrow led the scholar T. K. Abbot to the conclusion that the scribe of Kells had either the Book of Durrow, or a common model in hand.

===Text and script===
The Book of Kells contains the text of the four gospels based on the Vulgate. It does not, however, contain a pure copy of the Vulgate. There are numerous variants from the Vulgate, where Old Latin translations are used rather than Jerome's text. Although these variants are common in all of the insular gospels, there does not seem to be a consistent pattern of variation amongst the various insular texts. It is thought that when the scribes were writing the text they often depended on memory rather than on their exemplar.

[[Image:KellsFol309r.jpg|thumb|200px|Folio 309r contains text from the [[Gospel of John]] written in Insular majuscule by the scribe known as "Hand B".]]

The manuscript is written in [[Insular majuscule]], with some [[minuscule]] letters usually "c" and "s". The text is usually written in one long line across the page. [[Françoise Henry]] identified at least three scribes in this manuscript, whom she named Hand A, Hand B, and Hand C. Hand A is found on folios 1 through 19v, folios 276 through 289 and folios 307 through the end of the manuscript. Hand A for the most part writes eighteen or nineteen lines per page in the brown gall-ink common throughout the west. Hand B is found on folios 19r through 26 and folios 124 through 128. Hand B has a somewhat greater tendency to use minuscule and uses red, purple and black ink and a variable number of lines per page. Hand C is found throughout the majority of the text. Hand C also has greater tendency to use minuscule than Hand A. Hand C uses the same brownish gall-ink used by hand A, and wrote, almost always, seventeen lines per page.

[[Image:KellsFol200rGeneolgyOfChrist.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Luke's [[genealogy of Jesus]] (extends over three pages)]]
====Errors====
There are a number of [[Bible errata|differences]] between the text and the accepted [[gospel]]s. In the [[genealogy of Jesus]], which starts at [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 3:23, Kells erroneously names an extra ancestor. [[But to bring a sword|Matthew 10:34b]] should read ''“I came not to send peace, but the sword”''.  However rather than “gladium” which means “[[sword]]”, Kells has “gaudium” meaning “[[Happiness|joy]]”.  Rendering the verse in translation: ''“I came not <nowiki>[</nowiki>only<nowiki>]</nowiki> to send peace, but joy”.

===Decoration===
The text is accompanied by incredibly intricate full pages of artwork, with smaller painted decorations appearing throughout the text itself. The book has a broad palette of colours with purple, lilac, red, pink, green, and yellow being the colours most often used. (The illustrations in the Book of Durrow, by contrast, use only four colours.) Surprisingly, given the lavish nature of the work, there was no use of gold or silver leaf in the manuscript. The pigments used for the illustrations had to be imported from all over Europe.

The lavish illumination programme is far greater than any other surviving insular gospel book. There are ten surviving full page illuminations including two [[evangelist portrait]]s, three pages with the four [[evangelist symbols]], a [[carpet page]], a miniature of the [[Virgin and Child]], a miniature of Christ enthroned, and miniatures of the [[Arrest of Jesus]] and the [[Temptation of Christ]]. There are 13 surviving full pages of decorated text including pages for the first few words of each of the gospels.  There are many pages where only some of the text on the page is decorated. Eight of the ten pages of the canon tables have extensive decoration. It is highly probable that there were other pages of miniature and decorated text that are now lost. In addition to these major pages there are a host of smaller decorations and decorated initials scattered throughout the text.

The extant folios of the manuscript start with the fragment of the glossary of Hebrew names. This fragment occupies one column of folio 1 recto. The other column of the folio is occupied by a miniature of the four evangelist symbols, now much abraded. The miniature is oriented so that the volume must be turned ninety degrees in order to view it properly. The four evangelist symbols are a visual theme that runs throughout the book. They are almost always shown together so that the doctrine of unity of message of the four Gospels is emphasised.

[[Image:KellsFol002rCanonTable.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Folio 2r of the Book of Kells contains one of the [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebian]] Canon Tables]]

The unity of the Gospels is further emphasized by the decoration of the Eusebian canon tables. The canon tables themselves are designed to establish the unity of the Gospels by allowing readers to find corresponding passages from the gospels. The Eusebian canon tables normally requires twelve pages. In the Book of Kells the makers of the manuscript planned for twelve pages (folios 1v through 7r), but for unknown reasons condensed them into ten pages, leaving folios 6v and 7r blank. This condensation caused the canon tables to be unusable. The decoration of the first eight pages of the canon tables is heavily influenced by early Gospel Books from the Mediterranean. It was traditional to enclose the tables in an arcade. (See, for example the [[London Canon Tables]]). Kells does this, but with an Insular spirit. The arcades are not seen as architectural elements, but are rather stylised into geometric patterns which are then decorated with Insular motifs. The four evangelist symbols occupy the spaces under and above the arches. The last two canon tables are presented within a grid. This presentation is limited to Insular manuscripts and was first seen in the Book of Durrow.

The remainder of the book after the canon tables is broken into sections with the beginning of each section being marked by miniatures and full pages of decorated text. Each of the Gospels is introduced by a consistent decorative programme. The preliminary matter is treated as one section and introduced by a lavish decorative spread. In addition to the preliminaries and the Gospels, the "second beginning" of the Gospel of Matthew is also given its own introductory decoration.

[[Image:KellsFol007vMadonnaChild.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Folio 7v contains an image of the Virgin and Child. This is the oldest extant image of the Virgin Mary in a western manuscript.]]

The preliminary matter is introduced by an [[icon]]ic image of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin]] and [[Jesus|Child]] (folio 7v). This miniature is the first representation of the Virgin in a western manuscript. Mary is shown in an odd mixture of frontal and three-quarter pose. This miniature also bears a stylistic similarity to the carvings on the lid of St. [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|Cuthbert's]] coffin. The iconography of the miniature may ultimately derive from an Eastern or Coptic icon.

The miniature of the Virgin and Child faces the first page of text and is an appropriate preface to the beginning of the ''Breves Causae'' of Matthew, which begins ''Nativitas Christi in Bethlem'' (the birth of Christ in Bethlehem). The beginning page ([[:Image:KellsFol008rBrevCausMatt.jpg|folio 8r]]) of the text of the ''Breves Causae'' is decorated and contained within an elaborate frame. The two page spread of the miniature and the text make a vivid introductory statement for the prefatory material. The opening line of each of the sections of the preliminary matter is enlarged and decorated (see above for the ''Breves causae'' of Luke), but no other section of the preliminaries is given the same level of treatment as the beginning of the ''Breves Causae'' of Matthew.

[[Image:Kelljohn.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Folio 291v contains a portrait of [[John the Evangelist]].]]

The book was designed so that each of the Gospels would have an elaborate introductory decorative programme. Each Gospel was originally prefaced by a full page miniature containing the four evangelist symbols, followed by a blank page. Then came a portrait of the evangelist which faced the opening text of the gospel which was given an elaborate decorative treatment. The Gospel of Matthew retains both its Evangelist portrait ([[:Image:KellsFol028vPortMatt.jpg|folio 28v]]) and its page of Evangelist symbols (folio 27r, see above). The Gospel of Mark is missing the Evangelist portrait, but retains its Evangelist symbols page ([[:Image:KellsFol129v4EvangelistSymbols.jpg|folio 129v]]). The Gospel of Luke is missing both the portrait and the Evangelist symbols page. The Gospel of John, like the Matthew retains both its portrait (folio 291v, see at right) and its Evangelist symbols page ([[:Image:KellsFol290v4EvangelistSymbols.jpg|folio 290v]]). It can be assumed that the portraits for Mark and Luke, and the symbols page for Luke at one time existed, but have been lost. The use of all four of the Evangelist symbols in front of each Gospel is striking and was intended to reinforce the message of the unity of the Gospels.

[[Image:KellsFol029rIncipitMatthew.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Folio 29r contains the [[incipit]] to the [[Gospel of Matthew]] .]]

The decoration of the opening few words of each Gospel was lavish. These pages were, in effect turned into carpet pages. The decoration of these texts is so elaborate that the text itself is almost illegible. The opening page (folio 28r) of Matthew may stand as an example. (See illustration at left.) The page consists of only two words ''Liber generationis'' ("The book of the generation"). The "lib" of ''Liber'' is turned in to a giant monogram which dominates the entire page. The "er" of ''Liber'' is presented as interlaced ornament within the "b" of the "lib" monogram. ''Generationis'' is broken into three lines and contained within an elaborate frame in the right lower quadrant of the page. The entire assemblage is contained within an elaborate border. The border and the letters themselves are further decorated with elaborate spirals and [[Celtic knot|knot work]], many of them zoomorphic. The opening words of Mark, ''[[:Image:KellsFol130rIncipitMark.jpg|Initium evangelii]]'' ("The beginning of the gospel"), Luke, ''[[:Image:KellsFol188rQuoniam.gif|Quoniam quidem multi]]'', and John ''[[:Image:KellsFol292rIncipJohn.jpg|In principio erat verbum]]'' ("In the beginning was the Word") are all given similar treatments. Although the decoration of these pages was most extensive in the Book of Kells, these pages were decorated in all of the other Insular Gospel Books.

The Gospel of Matthew begins with a [[genealogy of Jesus]]. At {{bibleref|Matthew|1:18}}, the actual narrative of [[Nativity of Jesus|Christ's life starts]]. This "second beginning" to Matthew was given emphasis in many early Gospel Books, so much so that the two sections were often treated as separate works. The "second beginning" begins with the word "Christ". The Greek letters "[[Chi (letter)|Chi]]" and "[[Rho (letter)|Rho]]" were often used in mediaeval manuscripts to abbreviate the word "Christ". In Insular Gospel Books the initial "[[Labarum|Chi Rho]] [[monogram]]" was enlarged and decorated. In the Book of Kells, this second beginning was given a decorative programme equal to the those that preface the individual Gospels. Folio 32 verso has a miniature of Christ enthroned. (It has been argued that this miniature is one of the lost evangelist portraits. However, the iconography is quite different from the extant portraits, and current scholarship accepts this identification and placement for this miniature.) Facing this miniature, on [[:Image:KellsFol033rCarpetPage.jpg|folio 33 recto]], is the only Carpet Page in the Kells. (The single Carpet Page in Kells is a bit anomalous. The [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] has five extant Carpet Pages and the [[Book of Durrow]] has six.) The blank verso of folio 33 faces the single most lavish miniature of the early mediaeval period, the Book of Kells Chi Rho monogram, which serves as incipit for the narrative of the life of Christ.

[[Image:KellsFol034rChiRhoMonogram.jpg|thumb|right|Folio 34r contains the [[Labarum|Chi Rho]] monogram. [[Chi (letter)|Chi]] and [[Rho (letter)|Rho]] are the first two letters of the word "[[Christ]]" in [[Greek language|Greek]].]]

In the Book of Kells, the Chi Rho monogram has grown to consume the entire page. The letter "Chi" dominates the page with one arm swooping across the majority of the page. The letter "Rho" is snuggled underneath the arms of the Chi. Both letters are divided into compartment which are lavishly decorated with knot work and other patterns. The background is likewise awash in mass of swirling and knotted decoration. Within this mass of decoration are hidden animals and insects. Three angels arise from one of the cross arms of the Chi. This miniature is the largest and most lavish extant Chi Rho monogram in any Insular Gospel Books and is the culmination of a tradition that started with the [[Book of Durrow]].

The Book of Kells contains two other Full page miniatures which illustrate episodes from the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] story. The text of Matthew is illustrated with full page illumination of the ''Arrest of Christ'' ([[:Image:KellsFol114rArrestOfChrist.jpg|folio 114r]]). Jesus is shown beneath a stylised arcade while being held by two much smaller figures. In the text of Luke there is a full sized miniature of the ''[[Temptation of Christ]]'' ([[:Image:KellsFol202vTemptationOfChrist.jpg|folio 202v]]). Christ is shown from the waist up on top of the Temple. To his a right is a crowd of people, perhaps representing his disciples. To his left and below him is a black figure of [[Satan]]. Above him hover two [[angel]]s.

The verso of the folio containing the ''[[Arrest of Jesus|Arrest of Christ]]'' contains a full page of decorated text which begins "[[:Image:KellsFol114vTuncDicit.gif|Tunc dicit illis]]". Facing the miniature of the Temptation is another full page of decorated text (folio 203r "Iesus autem plenus"). In addition to this page five other full pages also receive elaborate treatment. In Matthew there is one other full page treatment of ([[:Image:KellsFol124rTuncCrucixerant.jpg|folio 124r]], "Tunc crucifixerant Xpi cum eo duos latrones"). In the Gospel of Mark, there are also two pages of decorated text ([[:Image:KellsFol183rEratAutem.jpg|folio 183r]], "Erat autem hora tercia", and folio 187v "[Et Dominus] quidem [Iesus] postquam"). The Gospel of Luke contains two pages of fully decorated text. (folio 188v "Fuit in diebus Herodis ", and [[:Image:KellsFol285rUnaAutem.jpg|folio 285r]] "Una autem sabbati valde"). Although these texts do not have miniatures associated with them it is probable that miniatures were planned to accompany each of these texts and have either been lost, or were never completed. There is no surviving full page of text in the Gospel of John other than the Incipit. However, in the other three Gospels all of the full pages of decorated text, except for folio 188c which begins the Nativity narration, occur within the Passion narrative. However, since the missing folios of John contain the Passion narrative, it is likely that John contained full pages of decorated text that have been lost.

[[Image:KellsDecoratedInitial.jpg|thumb|left|Almost all of the folios of the Book of Kells contain small illuminations like this decorated initial.]]

The decoration of the book is not limited to the major pages. Indeed all but two pages have at least some decoration. Scattered through the text are decorated initials and small figures of animals and humans often twisted and tied into complicated knots. Many significant texts, such as the ''[[Lord's Prayer|Pater Noster]]'' have decorated initials. The page containing text of the [[Beatitudes]] in Matthew ([[:Image:KellsFol040vBeatitudes.jpg|folio 40v]]) has a large miniature along the left margin of the page in which the letter "B" which begins each line is linked into an ornate chain. The genealogy of Christ found in the Gospel of Luke ([[:Image:KellsFol200rGeneolgyOfChrist.gif|folio 200r]]) contains a similar miniature in which the word "qui" is repeatedly linked along the left margin. Many of the small animals scattered throughout the text serve to mark a "turn-in-the-path" (that is, a place where a line is finished in a space above or below the original line). Many other animals serve to fill spaces left at the end of lines. No two of these designs are the same. No earlier surviving manuscript has this massive amount of decoration.

[[Image:KellsFol034rXRhoDet3.jpg|thumb|right|The decorations of the Book of Kells can be stunningly complex, as seen in this small detail of the Chi Rho monogram page. (Folio 34r)]]

The decorations are all of high quality. The complexity of these designs is often breath-taking. In one decoration, which occupies one inch square piece of a page, it is possible to count as many as 158 complex interlacements of white ribbon with a black border on either side. Some decorations can only be fully appreciated with magnifying glasses, although lenses of the required power are not known to have been available until hundreds of years after the book's completion. The complicated knot work and interweaving found in Kells and related manuscripts have many parallels in the metalwork and stone carving of the period. Since their gradual rediscovery from the 19th century on, these design have also had an enduring popularity. Indeed many of these motifs are used today in popular art including jewelery and [[tattoo]]s.

==Use==
The book had a sacramental, rather than educational purpose. A large, lavish Gospel, such as the Book of Kells would have been left on the high altar of the church, and taken off only for the reading of the Gospel during Mass. However, it is probable that the reader would not actually read the text from the book, but rather recite from memory. It is significant that the ''Chronicles of Ulster'' state that the book was stolen from the [[sacristy]] (where the vessels and other accruements of the [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] were stored) rather than from the monastic library. The design of the book seems to take this purpose in mind, that is the book was produced with appearance taking precedence over practicality. There are numerous uncorrected mistakes in the text. Lines were often completed in a blank space in the line above. The chapter headings that were necessary to make the canon tables usable were not inserted into the margins of the page. In general, nothing was done to disrupt the aesthetic look of the page: aesthetics were given a priority over utility.
