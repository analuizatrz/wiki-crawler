The system of '''education in Iceland''' is based upon the [[Education in the United States|American system]], and there are four levels: playschool, compulsory, upper secondary and higher. Education is mandatory for children aged 6–16. Most institutions are funded by the state; there are very few [[private school]]s in the country.

== Background ==
According to the [[Ministry of Education, Science and Culture (Iceland)|Ministry of Education, Science and Culture]]:
{{cquote|A fundamental principle of the Icelandic educational system is that everyone should have equal opportunities to acquire an education, irrespective of sex, economic status, residential location, religion, possible handicap, and cultural or social background.<ref name="bella">http://bella.mrn.stjr.is/utgafur/skolenska.pdf</ref><ref name="icelandexport">http://icelandexport.is/english/about_iceland/educational_system_in_iceland/</ref>}}
The Ministry of Education, Science and Culture has the jurisdiction of educational responsibility. Traditionally, education in [[Iceland]] has been run in the [[public sector]]; there is a small, although growing, number of [[private education]] institutions in the country.<ref name="private">http://www.iceland.is/people-and-society/EducationResearch/</ref> Over the years, the educational system has been [[Decentralisation|decentralised]], and responsibility for [[Primary education|primary]]  and [[Secondary education|lower secondary]] schools lies with the local authorities. The state runs [[Tertiary education|upper secondary schools]] and [[higher education]] institutions.

The Ministry issues the [[Curriculum|National Curriculum Guidelines]]. The National Centre for Educational Materials publishes educational materials for education institutions, and issues them free of charge. The Educational Testing Institute is the country’s sole [[examination board]]; responsible for issuing and grading national examinations.

There are 192 institutions catering for compulsory education, 42 schools for upper secondary education and 9 higher education institutions.<ref name="icelandexport"/>

== History ==
[[Image:2004 aug 2 120-09x1024.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The main building of [[Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík]].]]
The oldest [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in the country is [[Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík]], which traces its origin to [[1056]], when a school was established in [[Skálholt]]. The school was moved to [[Reykjavík]] in [[1786]], but poor housing conditions forced it to move again in [[1805]] to [[Bessastaðir]] near Reykjavík. In [[1846]] the school was moved to its current location, and a new building was erected for it in Reykjavík.<ref name="mennta">http://www.mr.is/jokull/jokull.php?page_id=101010000 (Icelandic)</ref>

The [[University of Iceland]] was the first higher education institution in the country, and was established on [[17 June]] [[1911]], uniting three former Icelandic schools: ''Prestaskólinn'', ''Læknaskólinn'' and'' Lagaskólinn'', which taught [[theology]], [[medicine]] and [[law]], respectively. The university originally had only [[Faculty (university)|faculties]] for these three fields, in addition to a faculty of [[humanities]]. The first [[rector]] of the university was Björn M. Ólsen, a professor in the faculty of humanities.

== Levels ==
The Icelandic education system comprises four levels: playschool, compulsory, upper secondary and higher.<ref name="levels">http://eng.menntamalaraduneyti.is/education-in-iceland/Educational_system/</ref>

=== Playschool ===
[[Nursery school|Playschool]] or ''leikskóli'', is non-compulsory education for those under the age of six, and is the first step in the education system. The current [[legislation]] concerning playschools was passed in [[1994]]. The [[Ministry of Education, Science and Culture (Iceland)|Ministry of Education, Science and Culture]] is responsible for the policies and methods that playschools must use, and they issue the National Curriculum Guidelines. They are also responsible for ensuring that the curriculum is suitable so as to make the transition into [[compulsory education]] as easy as possible. However, the Ministry does not implement the regulations and guidelines; instead this is the responsibility of the [[local authority]], who fund and administer playschools. In addition, the local authority employs representatives who supervise the playschools’ operation.

Parents must pay for their children to attend playschools. Around 30% of the costs of running the institutions are covered by these fees. [[Private education|Private]] playschools’ fees can be around 10–20% higher than those of public institutions. Almost all private schools receive some municipal funding.

The buildings are often purpose-built on a site where around 30-40m² of playing space is available for each child in the [[playground]]. Around 6m² per child is allocated indoors. The institutions are intended to be mixed sex. Playschools are intended for children under the age of six; the youngest children to attend are at least two years old. Children of [[single parent]]s and [[student]]s are given priority, and in some cases children with a [[handicap]] are also given priority. In the majority of cases, the children are divided into [[age group]]s, but in some smaller communities these may be grouped together.

Children attend playschool for a minimum of four and a maximum of nine hours per day.<ref name="bella"/>

=== Compulsory ===
[[Image:IcelandicCompulsoryEducationPie.svg|thumb|300px|A pie chart showing how an Icelandic child’s compulsory education time will be divided over a ten-year period.]]
Compulsory education or ''grunnskóli'' (lit. “basic school”), is the period of education which is compulsory for all. The legislation concerning compulsory education was passed in [[1995]], and in [[1996]] municipalities took over the running of compulsory education. It comprises [[Primary education|primary]] and lower [[secondary education]], which often takes place at the same institution. The law states that education is mandatory for children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 16. The school year lasts nine months, and begins between [[August 21]] and [[September 1]], ending between [[May 31]] and [[June 10]]. The minimum number of school days is 170, but after a new teachers’ wage contract, this will increase to 180. Lessons take place five days a week.

Responsibility lies with parents for making sure that their children attend and register at school. The law states that it is the responsibility of the municipality to give instruction and fund institutions (this includes [[Teacher|teaching]], [[Substitute teacher|substitute teaching]], [[administration]] and specialist services), and provide [[special education]] if required. There are no entry requirements for [[pupil]]s, and the acceptance rate is 100% at six years of age.<ref name="nations">http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Europe/Iceland-EDUCATION.html</ref>

Pupils have the right to attend a school in the area in which they live. The state requires that the school integrates handicapped pupils into [[Mainstreaming in education|mainstream education]]. 

The state is responsible for assessing institutions to make sure that they are operating within the law and the National Curriculum Guidelines. They also produce educational materials, and implement educational law and regulations.

Compulsory education is divided into ten [[Grade level|years]]. Schools which have all ten years, year one to seven, and years eight to ten are common. Those schools which teach from years eight to ten often have a wider [[Catchment area (human geography)|catchment area]]. The size of institutions is widely varied. In the [[Reykjavík]] urban area, schools can be up to 800 pupils in size. In rural areas, schools can have fewer than 10 pupils, and around 50% of schools have fewer than 100 pupils. All compulsory education institutions are mixed sex. Many counselling services are available, including help with studies and specific subjects; [[Psychology|psychological]] counselling is also available.

Each school must follow the National Curriculum Guidelines, but exceptions are made for schools with special characteristics. The school is required to create a school working plan and an annual calendar, organise teaching and pupil assessment and to provide extra-curricular activities. The number of lessons for each year is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" width="340px"
! Years !! Age range !! Lessons per week
|-
| 1–4 || 6–9 years || 30
|-
| 5–7 || 10–12 years || 35
|-
| 8–10 || 13–15 years || 37
|}

Nowadays, the National Curriculum Guidelines have provisions for those learning Icelandic whose [[mother tongue]] is a foreign language and deaf and hearing-impaired pupils. Pupils are expected to keep up with the pace of teaching; however those students who are struggling receive remedial teaching without being moved from most of their classes. An emphasis is made on providing a variety of teaching methods.<ref name="bella"/>

==== Assessment ====
In [[Iceland]], assessment and evaluation of pupils is conducted internally, and is not standardised between different institutions. Pupils are given regular reports to year their progress; however the way in which this is done varies between schools. For example, a numerical [[Grade (education)|year]] could be given, or an oral and written assessment may be given.

Conversely, there are nationally co-ordinated exams on offer at the end of the compulsory education period. They are optional. In school year [[2001]]–[[2002|2]] students were able to choose between five examinations, [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Danish language|Danish]] (or [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), [[English language|English]], [[mathematics]] and [[natural science]]s. In school year [[2002]]–[[2003|3]], a [[social science]]s option was also added. The Education Testing Institute compiles and years these examinations. The marking scheme ranges from one to ten, ten being the highest, based on referenced assessment criteria. Their principle purpose is to help ease the transition into upper [[secondary education]] and help the pupil to choose a course of study. Pupils are awarded a certificate with their marks at the end of the compulsory schooling period.

In addition to pupil assessment, the law requires that schools implement some form of self-evaluation on the quality of their services and to make sure that institutions are operating inside the law and within guidelines. Schools are assessed externally every five years by the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture.<ref name="bella"/>

==== Teachers ====
Similar to [[primary education]] in other countries, from years one to seven, the same [[teacher]] teaches the pupils all of their subjects. From year eight upwards, pupils receive teaching from a number of different teachers (this marks the boundary between primary education and lower secondary education). Groups may be mixed around year by year.

Primary school teachers are general teachers who have received their training at either the [[Iceland University of Education]] or the [[University of Akureyri]]. The typical course lasts three years. Lower secondary teachers may also be trained at the [[University of Iceland]]. A [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] or [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] degree is required in this situation. The courses are designed to be both academic and practical. Municipalities are responsible for the employment of teachers. Optional in-service [[teacher training]] courses are offered on an annual basis.<ref name="bella"/>

=== Upper secondary ===
[[Image:Stofa i hradbraut.jpg|thumb|300px|A classroom in the [[Menntaskólinn Hraðbraut|Hraðbraut]] [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]].]] 
Upper secondary education or ''framhaldsskóli'' (lit. “continued school”), follows lower [[secondary education]]. These schools are also known as [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasia]] in English. It is not compulsory, but everyone who has had their [[compulsory education]] has the right to upper secondary education.<ref name="icelandexport"/> The typical course length is four years, for students aged between 16 and 20. The length of the course can vary, especially in [[Vocational education|vocational courses]]. This stage of education is governed by the Upper Secondary School Act of 1996. Like all other schools in [[Iceland]], upper secondary schools are mixed sex. 

Students do not have to pay [[tuition fees]], but they must pay an enrolment fee and are expected to buy their own [[textbook]]s. Students who enrol on vocational courses pay a portion of the costs of the materials that they use. 

All students have a right to enter upper secondary education when they turn sixteen. Around 90% of students leaving lower secondary education enter into upper secondary education; however there is a notable drop out rate. There are specific entry requirements for different courses, but as all students have the right to this sort of education, a general programme of study is available for those students who may fail to meet requirements. 

The school year lasts for nine months, and is divided into two [[Academic term|term]]s: autumn and spring. Students attend around 32–40 lessons a week, each lasting 40-60 minutes. This can vary drastically between institutions.

There are around forty gymnasia in the country; sizes vary as much as the primary schools. The largest gymnasia have over 1,500 students—the smallest, less than fifty. The gymnasia can be divided thus:
* '''[[grammar school]]s'''—offering four-year long programmes of study, ending with [[matriculation]] exams;
* '''[[Vocational school|industrial-vocational schools]]'''—theoretical and practical courses in various trades;
* '''[[comprehensive school]]s'''—offering a mixture of courses, has qualities of both a grammar school and an industrial-vocational institution, in addition to specialised vocational programmes;
* '''[[Vocational school|specialised vocational schools]]'''—programmes of study for specific trades and careers.

The law requires that there are academic, vocational, artistic and general programmes of study, all of which lead to [[higher education]].

The gymnasia have forms which operate on a unit-credit system, that is to say a term is divided into course units, each of which is worth a certain number of credits. Students are consequently able to regulate the speed of their education based on their personal circumstances. This system is used in most upper secondary institutions in Iceland.

Many institutions also offer evening classes targeted at adults, some of which are on-a-par with their daytime courses. Distance learning is also offered at most schools.

Counselling services are also offered, like those of the compulsory education institutions.<ref name="bella"/>

==== Assessment ====
Examinations are taken at the end of every term as opposed to at the end of the year. Final years are often based on continuous assessments and assignments; however some courses do have final exams. There were no nationally co-ordinated exams in upper secondary education until school year [[2003]]–[[2004|4]], when certain subjects were introduced. Institutions are also required to self-assess, like compulsory education institutions they are assessed externally every five years.<ref name="bella"/>

==== Teachers ====
Upper secondary teachers are required to have completed four years at [[university]], at least two years of which must have been devoted to a major subject, and at least one of which devoted to teaching methodology and skills. Vocational teachers must be qualified in their particular discipline, or must be a [[master craftsman]] in their trade, and have at least two years of experience. 

In-service training courses are also offered. Teachers are paid by the state but hired by the individual school.<ref name="bella"/>

=== Higher education ===
[[Image:UniversityIcelandSeasons.png|thumb|400px|The [[University of Iceland Main Building]].]]
The final level is [[higher education]], or ''háskóli'' (lit. “high school”). There are [[List of universities in Iceland|nine such institutions]] in the country, most of which are run by the state. The first institution, the [[University of Iceland]], opened in [[1911]], and is still the principal higher education institution in the country.<ref name="háskóli">http://www.hi.is/page/HE_in_Iceland/</ref> In recent years, however, more universities have opened across the country, widening the range of choices available. Legislation concerning higher education institutions was passed in [[1997]], which includes a definition of the term ''háskóli'' (to include universities which do not carry out research). There is also separate legislation in place for each public institution, defining their role in [[research]] and general organisation.<ref name="euroed">http://www.euroeducation.net/prof/iceco.htm</ref> Private and public universities both receive funding from the state.<ref name="háskóli"/>

The administration of each university is divided into the [[Senate]], the [[rector]], [[Faculty (university)|faculty]] meetings, faculty councils and [[Dean (education)|dean]]s (however, some universities are not divided into faculties). The Senate ultimately makes decisions on the running and organisation of the institution, and formulates policy. The [[state]] will formulate a contract with the university, defining the institution’s objectives and the amount of funding that the state will give to the institution.

Despite the growing number of higher education institutions in the country, many students decide to pursue their university education abroad (around 16%, mostly in [[postgraduate]] studies).

The academic year lasts from [[September]] to [[May]], and is divided into two terms: autumn and spring.<ref name="bella"/>

==== Admission ====
Most  [[undergraduate]]s will have had to pass some form of [[matriculation]] exam to get into university<ref ="gfme">http://www.gfme.org/global_guide/pdf/99-104%20Iceland.pdf</ref>; however those with sufficient [[work experience]] may be admitted in some cases. Vocational and technical courses have looser requirements, only stating that the applicant have some sort of experience in their chosen field of study. Institutions are free to set their own admission criteria. Registration for potential students takes place from [[May]] to [[June]] each year; however the application deadline for foreign students is earlier: [[March 15]].<ref name="bella"/>

==== Student finance ====
In state-run institutions, students only need pay registration fees; there are no [[tuition fees]]. Private institutions, however, charge fees. All students are eligible to some financial support from the Icelandic Student Loan Fund; the exact amount depends on their financial and personal situation. The student must begin to repay this money two years after commencing their study programme. In addition to Icelandic students, students from the [[European Union]] or [[EEA]]-[[EFTA]] member states are also eligible to apply for loans, if they have been working in their trade in the country for at least one year. 

Annually there are a limited number of [[scholarship]]s available for foreign students to study the [[Icelandic language]] and [[Icelandic literature|literature]] at the University of Iceland, offered by the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture. 

[[Grant (money)|Grant]]s are available for post-graduates in research universities, which are awarded on the basis of joint submission from student and professor, and approval from the respective faculty.<ref name="bella"/>
