Change is a fact of life. On the positive side, change may be seen as akin to opportunity, rejuvenation, progress, innovation, and growth. But just as legitimately, change can also be seen as instability, upheaval, unpredictability, a threat, and disorientation. 

The concept of '''change management''' describes a structured approach to transitions in individuals, teams, organizations and societies that moves the target from a current state to a desired state. The most recent research points to a combination of organizational change management tools and individual change management models for effective change to take place.

In the early period of development of change management, the focus was on creating a desired future state through programs such as [[Total Quality Management|TQM]], [[Business process reengineering|BPR]] or [[Six Sigma]], and the process of managing the people side of change was neglected. The recent spate of corporate governance scandals has readjusted this trend to reflect a more balanced approach.

==Theories of Change==

The evolution of this field stems from psychology, business and engineering. Hence, some models are derived from an organizational development perspective whereas others are based on individual behavioral models. For this reason, this section is divided into two sub-categories: Individual Change Management and Organizational Change Management. Understanding of both individual and organizational change theory is necessary to implement effective change management processes and tools.

'''Individual Change Management'''

An early model of change developed by [[Kurt Lewin]] described change as a three-stage process. The first stage he called "unfreezing". It involved overcoming inertia and dismantling the existing "mind set". Defense mechanisms have to be bypassed. In the second stage the change occurs. This is typically a period of confusion. We are aware that the old ways are being challenged but we do not have a clear picture to replace them with yet. The third and final stage he called "refreezing". The new mindset is crystallizing and one's comfort level is returning to previous levels.

Some change theories are based on derivatives of the [[Kübler-Ross model]] from Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's book, "On Death and Dying." Her model describes five stages of human reaction to the loss of a loved one:
# '''Denial''' - The "This can't be real" stage:  
::''"This is not happening to me. There must be a mistake."''
:2. '''Anger''' - The "Why me?" stage.:  
::''"How dare they do this to me?!"'' 
:3. '''Bargaining''' - The "If I do this, you'll do that" stage.:  
::''"Just let me keep some of my old privileges and I will buy in."''
:4. '''Depression''' - The "Defeated" stage.:  
::''"I can't bear to face going through this."''
:5. '''Acceptance''' - The "This is going to happen" stage.:  
::''"I'm ready, I don't want to struggle anymore."''

A [[Formula for Change]] was developed by [[Richard Beckhard]] and [[David Gleicher]] and is sometimes referred to as [[Formula for Change|Gleicher's Formula]].  The [[Formula]] illustrates that the combination of organisational dissatisfaction, vision for the future and the possibility of immediate, tactical action must be stronger than the resistance within the organisation in order for meaningful changes to occur.

[[Manfred Max-Neef]] has developed a comprehensive model on human needs that explains resistance to change and potential interventions to deal with it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Max-Neef |first= Manfred A. |authorlink= Manfred Max-Neef|coauthors= |title= Human Scale Development Conception Application and Further Reflections |year= 1989|month= December|publisher= Apex Press|location= |id= ISBN 094525735X}}</ref>

Research conducted by Prosci with more than 1000 organizations from 59 countries shows that people must achieve five building blocks in order for change to be realized successfully. These building blocks are described by the '''ADKAR''' Model and include awareness, desire, knowledge, ability and reinforcement.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hiatt |first= Jeffrey |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= ADKAR: a model for change in business, government and our community |year= 2006 |publisher= Prosci Research|location= |id= ISBN 1930885504}}</ref>

# '''Awareness''' – of why the change is needed 
# '''Desire''' – to support and participate in the change 
# '''Knowledge''' – of how to change 
# '''Ability''' – to implement new skills and behaviors 
# '''Reinforcement''' – to sustain the change

'''Organizational Change Management'''

Organizational change management models present an overall process for managing the people side of the change at an organizational level. Models of this type have been developed by a number of different authors, corporations and research organizations over the past 30 years including work by John Kotter<ref name="Kotter">Kotter, John P. (1996). ''Leading Change'', Harvard Business School Press. ISBN 0875847471</ref>,Gabrielle O'Donovan<ref name="O'Donovan">O'Donovan, Gabrielle (2006). ''The Corporate Culture Handbook'', The Liffey Press. ISBN 1904148972</ref> Prosci Research (Change Management Toolkit), Daryl Connor<ref name="Conner">Conner,Daryl R.  (1993). ''Managing At the Speed of Change '', Random House ISBN 0679406840</ref>, Jeanenne LaMarsh <ref name="LaMarsh"> LaMarsh, Jeanenne (1995). ''Changing the Way We Change: Gaining Control of Major Operational Change '', New York: Prentice Hall. ISBN 0201633647</ref>, Dean Anderson and Linda Ackerman (Beyond Change Management), GE (GE CAP process) and work by Holger Nauheimer (Change Management Toolbook) to name a few.  When combined with an understanding of individual change management, these models provide a framework for managing the people side of change.  

==Management's role==

Management's first responsibility (and that of administration in case of political changes) is to detect trends in the macroenvironment as well as in the microenvironment so as to be able to identify changes and initiate programs. It is also important to estimate what impact a change will likely have on employee behaviour patterns, work processes, technological requirements, and motivation. Management must assess what employee reactions will be and craft a change program that will provide support as workers go through the process of accepting change. The program must then be implemented, disseminated throughout the organization, monitored for effectiveness, and adjusted where necessary.

Gabrielle O'Donovan has designed a strategic implementation plan for a culture transformation programme.

==Schools and Concepts of Change Management==
{{expert-subject|Physics}}
{{Confusing|29 December 2006}}

Most contemporary approaches to change management are based on one or more of the following three principles -

'''Organizations are ruled by laws of complexity (The systemic/complexity principle)'''
Emerging evidence from [[systems theory]] and [[chaos theory]] indicates that large social systems cannot be explained by [[Newton's laws of motion]] that is their behaviour is basically non-predictable.{{Or}} Instead, change management helps such systems to jointly move towards a self-chosen direction. Some examples of methodologies that apply systemic principles are 
*[[Appreciative Inquiry]], 
*[[Open Space Technology]], 
*Systemic Constellations, 
*[[The World Cafe]], etc. 

'''We are living in a field which is a whole (The quantum principle)'''
Most of our day-to-day assumptions are still based on classical [[Newtonian mechanics]], which usually are applied to working with organizations.{{Or}} For example, most people would assume that if A is true, B is false. There is a growing number of thinkers who relate change in organizations to [[Quantum Mechanics]], which teaches us that if A is true, B is equally true - just another side of the coin -, and that A could not exist without B.{{Or}} Observers (or consultants, or leaders) are always part of a field, which they influence but by which they are influenced themselves instantly. Some examples for the application of Quantum Mechanics to Change Management:{{Or}}
*[[Process Oriented Psychology]] by [[Arnold Mindell]] talks about the field in which each human relationship exists. Its application field, [[Process Oriented Psychology#History|Worldwork]], intends to transform systems by shifting roles that people unconsciously hold in a system.
*[[David Bohm#Bohm Dialogue|Dialogue]] (by [[David Bohm]]) is a new form of communication in large groups that is based on the suspension of assumptions, thus letting the common knowledge of a group emerge.
*[[Appreciative Inquiry]], one of the most frequently applied approaches to organizational change, is partly based on the assumption that change in a system is instantaneous ('Change at the Speed of Imagination')
*Theory U of Otto Scharmer who describes a process in which change strategies are based on the emerging future rather than on lesson from the past.<ref>{{cite book |last=Senge |first= Peter |authorlink= |coauthors= C. Otto Scharmer, Joseph Jaworski, Betty Sue Flowers|title= Presence: Human Purpose and the Field of the Future |year= 2004 |month= March |publisher= Society for Organizational Learning|location= |id= ISBN 0974239011}}</ref>

'''The map is not the territory (The constructionist principle)''' 
The [[:map/territory relation]] is proven by neuroscience and is used to signify that individual people do not have access to absolute knowledge of reality, but in fact only have access to a set of beliefs they have built up over time, about reality. It has been coined into a model by [[Chris Argyris]] called the Ladder of Inference<ref>{{cite journal |quotes= |last= Argyris|first= Chris|authorlink= Chris Argyris|coauthors= |year= 1982|month= Autumn|title= |journal= Organizational Dynamics,|volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url= http://www.monitor.com/binary-data/MONITOR_ARTICLES/object/92.pdf|format= PDF|accessdate= 2006-12-29}}</ref>. As a consequence, communication in change processes needs make sure that information about change and its consequences is presented in such a way that people with different belief systems can access this information. Methods that are based on the Map/Territory Relation help people to
-	become more aware of their own thinking and reasoning (reflection),
-	make their thinking and reasoning more visible to others (advocacy), and
-	inquire into others' thinking and reasoning (inquiry). 
Some methodological frameworks that are based on this principle are:
*[[Neuro-linguistic programming]] (NLP), an eclectic school of psychotherapy developed by [[Richard Bandler]], [[John Grinder]], [[Robert Dilts]], and others;
*Circular Questioning and other techniques basically developed in Systemic Family Therapy;<ref>{{cite web

*[[Gestalt Psychology]], a theory of mind and brain that proposes that the operational principle of the brain is holistic, parallel, and analog, with self-organizing tendencies;
*The concept of the Fifth Discipline by [[Peter Senge]] and other management thinkers
*Scenario Thinking, a method that helps people to create stories about the future

==Change management in industrial plants==

Since complex processes can be very sensitive to even small changes.  Proper management of change to industrial facilities and processes is recognized as critical to safety.   In the US, [[OSHA]] has regulations that govern how changes are to be made and documented.  The main requirement is that a thorough review of a proposed change be performed by a multi-disciplinary team to ensure that as many possible viewpoints are used as possible to minimize the chances of missing a hazard.  In this contect, the management of change is known as 'Change Controls' and it is just one component of [[Process Safety Management]].
