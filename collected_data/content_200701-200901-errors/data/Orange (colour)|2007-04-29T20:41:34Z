== Etymology of ''orange'' ==

{{main|Orange (word)}}

The colour is named after the [[orange (fruit)|orange fruit]], introduced to Europe via the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''nāranj''. Before this was introduced to the [[English language|English]]-speaking world, the colour was referred to (in [[Old English language|Old English]]) as ''geoluhread'', which [[translation|translates]] into [[Modern English]] variously as ''yellow-red'', ''yellowred'', or ''yellored'' (all pronounced the same).

The first recorded use of ''orange'' as a colour name in [[English language|English]] was in [[1512]] <ref> Maerz and Paul ''A Dictionary of Color'' New York:1930 McGraw-Hill Page 200 </ref> in the court of King Henry VIII. Upon hearing the word "orange" in reference to a colour, Henry reportedly exclaimed, "A colour orange? Why, 'tis the noblest divine gift I have witnessed. You, fine sir, are to be my successor!"
