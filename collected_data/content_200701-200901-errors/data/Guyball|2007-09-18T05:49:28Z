'''Guyball''' (pronounced ''gheeball'', {{IPA2|'gi:bɔ:l}}) is a fictional [[game]] featured and (somewhat) described in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Green Wing]]''.

The most renowned player is the fictional half-[[Swiss]] anaesthetist [[Guy Secretan|Dr Guy Secretan]]. Due to the similarity between his name and that of Guyball, and the fact that Guyball's specialist terminology has a heavy Swiss influence, it seems certain that Guy invented it. He has claimed that he is to Guyball "what [[William Webb Ellis]] was to wugby... [[rugby football|rugby]]".<ref name="S2E7">{{cite episode | title = Series 2, Episode 7 | series = Green Wing | serieslink =  Green Wing (series 2) | airdate = 2006-05-12 | season = 2 | number = 7}}</ref> He first played Guyball at [[Whiteleaf Public School|Whiteleaf]] (pronounced ''witliff'', {{IPA2|'wɪtlɪf}}), a public school he attended for twelve years (1977-90).<ref>Green Wing - The Complete First Series Scripts page 118.</ref>

In the real world it is clearly inspired by the obscure sports played solely at particular real English public schools – such as the [[Eton Wall Game]] and [[Winchester College Football]] – and quite possibly by other fictional games whose rules are semi-fixed at best, such as [[Calvinball]] and [[Mornington Crescent (game)|Mornington Crescent]]. However, it has entered into the real world as a real sport currently only available at [[King's College London]].

Guyball is first mentioned in the seventh episode of series one of ''[[Green Wing]]'', "Tangled Webs", as Guy prepares for a world championship semi-final, having won his second-round match in five straight ''clappers''. Other noted players include [[Recurring guest characters in Green Wing#Markus Geissler|Markus Geissler]], "The Big Austrian", who Guy walked over in the first round because he had [[shin splints]].<ref name="TW">{{cite episode|title=Tangled Webs|series=Green Wing|serieslink=Green Wing (series 1)|airdate=2004-10-15|season=1|episode=7}}</ref> According to ''Green Wing - The Complete First Series Scripts'', the official home of Guyball is the Secretanstad in [[Lausanne]].<ref>''Green Wing - The Complete First Series Scripts'' page 295.</ref> The idea for Guyball was first created by ''Green Wing'' writer [[Richard Preddy]], and it was later developed by the other writers.<ref name="BSG news">{{cite web|last=Boosey |first=Mark |title=Green Wing News |publisher=British Sitcom Guide|url=http://www.sitcom.co.uk/green_wing/news.shtml|date=2007-01-22|accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref>

== Basic rules ==
The object of the game, according to Guy, is simply "to put the ball into the basket". The basket in question is part of the ''topmiler'', a special helmet worn by one or more of the players. This consists of a wicker basket (fastened to the player's head by a leather strap) with an attached pair of flying goggles to protect the eyes. Whether or not a given player wears a topmiler, hurls balls at their opponents, or has balls hurled at them, seems to vary depending on circumstance.<ref name="TW"/>

Before starting a match, one is encouraged to ''splice the [[Matterhorn]]'' by insulting one's opponents – though this might very well be a means, invented by Guy on the spur of the moment, for getting away with shouting abuse at a group of children (see below).<ref name="S2E4">{{cite episode | title = Series 2, Episode 4 | series = Green Wing | serieslink =  Green Wing (series 2) | airdate = 2006-04-21 | season = 2 | number = 4}}</ref> It starts when the official shouts ''Commence''.<ref name="TW"/>

== Advanced rules ==
The detailed rules of Guyball depend on the variation being played. A "classic three-person variation of the game", in which two people chase the wearer of the topmiler, is described by Guy to his colleague [[Martin Dear|Dr Martin Dear]] (as Martin wears an improvised topmiler made of a wicker bin sellotaped to his head) as follows:

:"Don't leave the parish, all right? If you reach the maison, put your left arm in the air and shout 'Maison!'. [...] There are no burrow tactics and there are no hedgehogs, OK? [...] I won the toss so ''stickles'' are random [...] and it's a two-bounce ''ubique''. Right. Go! Move!"<ref name="TW"/>

One might also play with orthodox or alternate stickles and a four-bounce ubique ({{IPA2|'u:bɪkweɪ}}), though this tends to be in matches in which the two sides have an equal number of players, all of whom wear topmilers.<ref name="S2E4"/> Positions in which Guyball players may find themselves include:

* The ''[[Emmental]] loop'', in which one has a ''cleft mitten'' showing whilst one crouches to attack one's opponent.<ref name="S2E4"/>
* The ''classical heist'', an attack in which one is standing with one's foot on the opponent's jaw and one's topmiler is empty.<ref name="S2E4"/>
* The ''fat chalet'', similar to the classical heist but for the latter one's topmiler is ''geometrically loaded'', that is, contains a large six-sided [[dice|die]].<ref name="S2E4"/>

It is unknown who the reigning world Guyball champion is as of [[2006]], though Guy is still an active player and taught Guyball to some local children as part of his community service.<ref name="S2E4"/> He has claimed that if he had twelve children himself he would teach Guyball to all of them.<ref name="S2E8">{{cite episode | title = Series 2, Episode 8 | series = Green Wing | serieslink =  Green Wing (series 2) | airdate = 2006-05-19 | season = 2 | number = 8}}</ref> Jake Leaf, East Hampton Hospital's alternative therapist and the object of [[Caroline Todd (Green Wing character)|Dr Caroline Todd's]] short-lived affections towards the end of series two, does not play Guyball; however, he succeeded in discomfiting Guy by putting on a topmiler and claiming he did. He said his ''settle rate'' was 37, with alternate stickles. Guy grudgingly admitted that this was very good. When asked for his own settle rate, Guy claimed to have forgotten it.<ref name="S2E7"/>

According to ''The Complete First Series Scripts'', a player can also be sent off for "Illegal use of the ''hefty fondue''." This happened between Guy Secretan and Markus Geissler, during a match at the Secretanstadt, [[Lausanne]]. Guy won 12:3.<ref name="Scripts">''Green Wing - The Complete First Series Scripts'' page 217.</ref>

== Guyball as a possible Olympic sport ==
In ''The Complete First Series Scripts'', there is a letter from the [[Olympic Committee]] to Guy about making Guyball an [[Olympic sport]].<ref name="Scripts"/> The results reached by the committee were:

* "We do not think that Guyball is "The Bollocks"."
* "Guyball will not be included in the forthcoming [[Olympic Games]]."
* "Contrary to whatever your friend "Diggler" might have heard, we do not accept "Bungs"."
* "We are not biased against Switzerland or any other nation."
* "We do not care if you know where we live."

== Guyball in real-life ==
Despite the fact that Guyball is a fictional game, many fans have tried to play the game in real-life, forming their own rules and forming societies.

=== The King's College London Guyball Society ===
Currently the only organised society to play Guyball in the UK is based in King's College London. It was founded by Jane Macallan and Anna Jones, and claim that it has been approved by [[Stephen Mangan]], the actor who plays Guy, and ''Green Wing's'' writers. According to an audio commentary on series 2, episode 4 of ''Green Wing'', [[Tamsin Greig]] says that the students were given money to research the rules, and if none existed, to invent them.<ref>''Green Wing'' Series 2, Episode 4, audio commentary (version 2). Featuring Tamsin Greig and Lucinda Raikes.</ref> 

According to the King's College London rules, the games is played by two mixed teams of six players each, one blue, one green. It states that "The aim of the game is to score as many ''swatches'' (equivalent to goals/tries etc.) by successfully carrying the main ball (the ''Ubique'') into your team's ''Maison''. Players can perform a variety of set ''tackles'' to capture the ''Ubique'' from the opposing team using the red ''Stickle'' and can send team members onto and off the pitch (into the ''Parish'') using ''Stickles'' (the same colours as that of the teams). Being ''geometrically loaded'' enhances some tackles." The rules also state the length of ''clappers'', the size of the pitch, fouls, and other rules and regulations.

=== The Wingin' It ''Green Wing'' convention ===
So far, the only recorded game of Guyball to have been played in real-life was at the first ''Green Wing'' [[fan convention|convention]], ''Wingin' It''. The match was umpired by Stephen Mangan, and was organised by ''Green Wing's'' production assistant Patrick Schulenburg. During the six-on-six match, the played [[Geneva]] rules, geometric stickles, the players spliced the matterhorn, insulting Mangan. The first goal scored was an [[own goal]], as the team ran into their own parish. It was reported that some of the players were injured during the match.<ref name="BSG">[http://www.sitcom.co.uk/green_wing/convention.shtml British Sitcom Guide - ''Green Wing'' Convention.] Accessed [[23 January]] [[2007]].</ref> It is known that this match will appear on ''The Definitive Collection'' DVD boxset.<ref name="BSG"/>
