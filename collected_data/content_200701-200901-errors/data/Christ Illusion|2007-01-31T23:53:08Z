}}'''''Christ Illusion''''' is the ninth studio album by American [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]], released on [[August 8]], [[2006]].  Generally receiving mixed critical reviews, the album entered the Billboard 200 at #5, the highest chart position ever achieved by the band in the U.S. Including the Grammy nominated lead single "Eyes of the Insane", it is the band's first album to feature original drummer [[Dave Lombardo]] since ''[[Seasons in the Abyss]]'' ([[1990]]). 

Depicting a mutilated Christ painted by longtime collaborator [[Larry Carroll]], the album's graphic artwork courted controversy. An alternative, non-graphic cover was issued to conservative retailers who felt uncomfortable with the original cover. Lyrical themes, especially the song "[[Jihad (song)|Jihad]]" which described the [[9/11 terrorist attacks]] from a terrorist perspective, outraged the Mumbai based ''Catholic Secular Forum'' in India. As a result, all Indian stocks of the album were recalled and destroyed by [[EMI]] India.

==Recording==
''Christ Illusion'' was recorded at two venues: NRG, North Hollywood, with assistant engineering by Dave Colvin, and Westlake Studios, Los Angeles, with assistant engineering by Brian Warwick.<ref name="AlbumNotes">''Christ Illusion'' album notes'', August 8, 2006.

Critical reviews of the album were generally mixed. Chris Steffen of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine dismissed the album, saying it "mines much of the same territory as its predecessor, ''God Hates Us All'', just without the memorable riffs."<ref name="StoneReview">''"Review: New SLAYER Album Is 'God Hates Us All' Without The Memorable Riffs'"'', July 10 2006.

Despite the dismissal, drummer Lombardo came in for appraisal with the quip "at least their awesome drummer Dave Lombardo shows off some chops."<ref name="StoneReview"/>  ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper's Jamie Thomson called the effort "wholly disappointing", with the band "unwilling to ditch the nu-metal tendencies that have made much of their recent output so resistible."<ref name="GuardianReview">Thomson, Jamie.

==Album artwork and lyrical themes==
Slayer came under fire due to several concerns surrounding ''Christ Illusion''. This was largely as a result of the [[Larry Carroll]] painted album cover which depicted a mutilated, stoned Jesus, alongside controversial lyrical matter concerning terrorism, warfare and religion.

===Album artwork===
Larry Carroll, who had painted the cover artwork to previous Slayer albums such as ''[[Reign in Blood]]'', ''[[South of Heaven]]'' and ''[[Seasons in the Abyss]]'',  resumed such duties on ''Christ Illusion''.<ref name="FinalArtwork">''"SLAYER: 'Christ Illusion' Final Album Artwork Posted Online"'', June 15 2006.
