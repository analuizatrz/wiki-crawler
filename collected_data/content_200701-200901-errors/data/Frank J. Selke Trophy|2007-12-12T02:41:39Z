The '''Frank J. Selke Trophy''' is awarded annually to the [[National Hockey League]] [[Forward (ice hockey)|forward]] who demonstrates the most skill in the defensive component of the game.

==History==
The trophy was first awarded at the end of the [[1977-78 NHL season]].  It was named after [[Frank J. Selke]], former general manager of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and [[Montreal Canadiens]].<ref name="SelkeNHLsite"/>  

The first recipient was [[Bob Gainey]] of the Canadiens, who won the trophy the first four years it was given, and to date he has won it more times than any other player.<ref name="SelkeLegends">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/silver_splashfrankselke.htm|title=Legends of Hockey-NHL Trophies-Frank J. Selke Trophy|publisher=Legends of Hockey|accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref> Players from the Montreal Canadiens have won the trophy the most times, with 7 times, yet only two different players won it with the Canadiens. Gainey won it four times and [[Guy Carbonneau]] won it three times. Players from the [[Detroit Red Wings]] have won it four times, with [[Sergei Fedorov]] (twice), [[Steve Yzerman]] and [[Kris Draper]].<ref name="SelkeNHLsite"/>

There has been only one instance in which a Selke Trophy winner was also awarded the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] for Most Valuable Player, which was when Sergei Fedorov captured both trophies during the [[1993-94 NHL season]].<ref name="SelkeFedorov">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=FST&year=1993-94|title=Legends of Hockey-Silverware-1993-94 Frank J. Selke Trophy Winner-Federov, Sergei|accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref>  There has not been an instance in which the [[Art Ross Trophy]] winner has been awarded the Selke Trophy, though Fedorov finished second in regular season scoring in 1994,<ref name="SelkeFedorov"/> while Art Ross Trophy runner-up [[Joe Sakic]] finished second in Selke voting in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=FST&year=2000-01|title=Legends of Hockey-Silverware-2000-01 Frank J.
