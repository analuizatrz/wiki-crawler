{{nihongo|'''''Chrono Trigger'''''|クロノ・トリガー|Kurono Torigā}} is a [[console role-playing game]] [[video game developer|developed]] and [[video game publisher|published]] by [[Square Co.|Square]] (now [[Square Enix]]) for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1995. The game's story follows a group of young adventurers who travel through time to prevent a global catastrophe. Square re-released a ported version by [[TOSE]] in Japan for [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation]] in 1999, later repackaged with a ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'' port as ''[[Final Fantasy Chronicles]]'' in 2001. A slightly enhanced ''Chrono Trigger'' was  released for the [[Nintendo DS]] on November 25th, 2008<ref>http://na.square-enix.com/ctds/</ref> in North America and Japan, and will come to Europe in early 2009. It has never been released in [[PAL region|PAL]] territories on the SNES or the PlayStation.

''Chrono Trigger'' was developed by a group that [[Square Co.|Square]] called the "Dream Team", consisting of [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], [[Kazuhiko Aoki]], and composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]—known for their works on the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series—and [[Yuuji Horii]] and artist [[Akira Toriyama]], freelance designers for [[Enix]]'s ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series.<ref name="Dream-team-name">{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co. | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System  | quote='''Keizo Kokubo:''' Well then, open the Gates to the Dream Team! ... / '''Developer's Ending:''' Cheers! You made it to one of the endings! You're now a member of the Dream Team!}}</ref> [[Masato Kato]] wrote most of the plot, while composer [[Yasunori Mitsuda]] scored most of the game before falling ill and deferring his duties to Uematsu.<ref name="procyon">{{cite web | month=November | year=1999 | title=Procyon Studio: Interview with Masato Kato | url=http://mitsuda.cocoebiz.com/friends/kato.html | publisher=Cocoebiz.com | accessdate=3 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref><ref name="powerup" />

''Chrono Trigger'' was well-received by reviewers and commercially successful. ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' magazine described certain aspects of ''Chrono Trigger'' as revolutionary, including its multiple endings, plot-related [[Quest (gaming)#Side-quest|sidequests]] focusing on character development, unique battle system, and detailed graphics.<ref name="npreview1">{{Cite journal |month=July | year=1995 |volume=74 |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |title=Epic Center: Chrono Trigger |pages=p.&nbsp;52}}</ref> The game has shipped more than 2.36 million copies in Japan and 290,000 worldwide as of March 31, 2003.<ref name="square-sales"/>

==Gameplay==
''Chrono Trigger'' features standard [[console role-playing game]] (RPG) gameplay with several innovations. The player controls the protagonist and his companions in the game's [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] [[fictional universe|fictional world]], consisting of various forests, cities, and dungeons. Navigation occurs via an [[overworld]] map, depicting the landscape from a scaled down overhead view. Areas such as forests, cities, and similar places are depicted as more realistic scaled down maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s gameplay deviates from that of traditional RPGs in that, rather than appearing in [[random encounter]]s, many enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party. Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the map rather than on a separate battle screen.<ref name="npreview2">{{Cite journal |month=July | year=1995 |volume=74 |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |title=Epic Center: Chrono Trigger |pages=p.&nbsp;53}}</ref> This concept had previously been featured in such titles as ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy Adventure]]'', but was uncommon at the time for RPGs outside the [[Action role-playing game|action RPG]] genre.
[[Image:ChronoTriggerInside.PNG|thumb|256px|left|Example of a basic battle]]
Players and enemies may use physical or magical attacks to wound targets during battle, and players may use items to heal or protect themselves.  Each character and enemy has a certain number of [[hit point]]s, and successful attacks reduce that character's hit points, while hit points can be restored with potions and spells.  When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints; if all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved chapter, except in specific storyline-related battles that allow or force the player to lose.  Between battles, the player can equip his/her characters with weapons, armor, helmets, and accessories that provide special effects (such as increased attack power or defense against magic), and various consumable items can be used both in and out of battles.  Items and equipment can be purchased in shops or found on field maps, often in [[Treasure chest (video games)|treasure chests]].  By exploring new areas and fighting enemies, players progress through ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s story.

''Chrono Trigger'' uses an [[Active Time Battle]] system—a staple of Square's ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' game series designed by [[Hiroyuki Itō]] for ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''—named "Active Time Battle 2.0".<ref name="gafreview">{{cite web | first=Robert |last=Johnson | title=Final Fantasy IV Review | date=April 28, 2003 | url=http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/review.php?reviewid=197 |publisher=GamesAreFun |accessdate=2006-09-10}}</ref> Each character can take action in battle once a personal timer dependent on the character's speed [[Attribute (role-playing games)|statistic]] counts to zero. Magic and special physical techniques are handled through a system called "Techs". Techs deplete a character's [[magic point]]s (a numerical meter like hit points), and often have special [[area of effect|areas of effect]]; some spells damage huddled monsters, while others can harm enemies spread in a line. Enemies often change positions during battle, creating opportunities for tactical Tech use. A unique feature of ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Tech system is that numerous cooperative techniques exist.<ref name="npreview2" /> Each character receives eight personal Techs which can be used in conjunction with others' to create Double and Triple Techs for greater effect. For instance, Crono's sword-spinning ''Cyclone'' Tech can be combined with Lucca's ''Flame Toss'' to create ''Fire Whirl''. When characters with compatible Techs have enough magic points available to perform their techniques, the game automatically displays the combo as an option.

''Chrono Trigger'' features several other unique gameplay traits, including [[time travel]]. Players have access to seven eras of the game world's history, and past actions affect future events. Throughout history, players find new allies, complete side quests, and search for keynote villains. Time travel is accomplished via portals and pillars of light called "time gates", as well as a [[Time travel|time machine]] named ''[[Epoch (Chrono Trigger)|Epoch]]''. The game contains thirteen unique endings; the ending the player receives depends on when and how he or she reaches and completes the game's final battle.<ref name="nppreview">{{Cite journal| volume=73 |month=June | year=1995 |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |title=Chrono Trigger: A New Standard for RPGs | pages=p.&nbsp;37}}</ref> The re-release of ''Chrono Trigger'' for the DS features a new ending that can be accessed from the End of Time upon completion of the final extra dungeon. The ending is reported to contain a new optional final boss. ''Chrono Trigger'' also introduces a [[New Game Plus|New Game+]] option—after completing the game, the player may begin a new game with the same character [[Experience point|levels]], [[Skill (role-playing games)|techniques]], and equipment (but not money) that he or she ended the previous game with. Certain items central to the storyline are removed and must be found again, such as the sword Masamune. Square has since employed the New Game+ concept in later titles, including ''[[Vagrant Story]],'' ''[[Chrono Cross]]'', ''[[Parasite Eve series|Parasite Eve]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]''.

''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s seven playable characters come from different eras in the game world's history. ''Chrono Trigger'' begins in 1000 A.D. with [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Crono|Crono]], [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Marle|Marle]], and [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Lucca|Lucca]]. Crono is the silent protagonist, characterized as a fearless young man with an interest in the art of wielding [[katana]]s. Marle,  lives in the castle, which is surrounded by lush forests. A protected girl, daring but reckless,  who on one occasion, slips out of the castle and travels around the fair belying her royal lineage. Lucca is a friend of Crono and a mechanical genius who wields a gun; her home is filled with laboratory equipment and machinery.

From the era of A.D. 2300 comes [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Robo|Robo]], a robot with a helpful and near-human personality created to assist humans. It is outfitted with a powerful arm. Found dormant in the future, Robo is repaired by Lucca and joins the group in an act of gratitude.<ref name="characters">{{cite book | year=2001 | title=Final Fantasy Chronicles instruction manual | pages=pp.&nbsp;32–33 | publisher=Square Enix  | id=SLUS-01363}}</ref>The fiercely confident [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Ayla|Ayla]] dwells in 65,000,000 B.C. Unmatched in raw strength, Ayla is the chief of Ioka Village, and leads her people in war against a species of humanoid [[reptile]]s known as Reptites.

The last two characters — [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Frog|Frog]], and the character [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Magus|Magus]] — which you will meet sooner than later, originate in A.D. 600. Frog is a former [[squire]] once named Glenn; Magus turned Glenn into an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] frog and also slew his friend Cyrus. Chivalrous but mired in regret, Frog dedicates his life to protecting Leene, the queen of Guardia, and avenging Cyrus. Meanwhile, Guardia in A.D. 600. is in a state of war against the Mystics, a race of demons and intelligent animals. Under the leadership of Magus, a powerful [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] they wage war against humanity. While Magus appears to be a power magician, his seclusiveness contains a long-lost past, a time when he used to be known as Janus, the young prince of the Kingdom of Zeal, which was destroyed by Lavos in 12,000 B.C. The incident sent him forward through time, and as he ages, he plots revenge against Lavos and broods over the fate of his sister, [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Schala|Schala]].<ref name="characters" /> Lavos, awakens and ravages the world in A.D. 1999, is an extraterrestrial parasitic creature that harvests DNA and the Earth's energy for its own growth.

===Story===
''Chrono Trigger'' begins with the Millennial Fair, where Crono had been waiting so eagerly for it to start. He wakes up late and coincidentally bumps into a royal princess whom he agrees to take around. and view Lucca's exhibition -a new teleportation device. Marle volunteers as the first guinea pig to the untested device, but disappears through a strange portal a reaction occurs between the pendant she was wearing round her neck and with the teleportation machine.<ref name="portal">'''Taban:''' What's going on Lucca?

But everyone calls me, Leene! {{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System  }}</ref> Marle then vanishes; Lucca arrives and claims that Marle is actually the princess of Guardia in A.D. 1000, and that since her ancestor was not rescued, Marle [[grandfather paradox|ceased to exist]]. With the help of a talking amphibian called Frog, Crono and Lucca rescue the real Queen, kidnapped by "Mystics" who worship the [[Wizard (character class)|wizard]] Magus. Marle reappears and the group returns to A.D. 1000, where Crono is placed on trial for allegedly kidnapping Marle. He's sentenced to death, and while awaiting his execution he breaks free from prison. With Marle and Lucca, he flees the king, to nearby Guardia Forest, where they stumble into yet another time portal.

They are shocked to find a devastated futuristic world filled with ruins, and uncover a video of the "Day of Lavos". The video shows a creature called Lavos erupting from the planet's surface in A.D. 1999 and causing fire to rain from the sky, decimating the entire planet.<ref name="dayoflavos">'''Marle:''' Say, what does this button do? / '''Lucca:'''1999 A.D.?

Melchior notes that he needs Dreamstone, a rock found only in antiquity, to repair the Masamune. The group travel to 65,000,000 B.C. and meet the cavewoman Ayla, who gives Crono her Dreamstone after a friendly drinking contest. Ayla's boyfriend, Kino, gets jealous of Crono, thinking that Ayla likes him better and steals the Gate Key, after which he is assaulted by a human resistance tribe of reptiles known as Reptilians, the Gate Key is stolen, after Ayla makes up with Kino, the group attacks a Reptilian fortress where the Reptilian King Azala demands to know the truth behind the gate key, after a battle with one of his dinosaur army generals, he returns the gate key, and Crono and company leave Ayla behind and return to their quest.<ref name="frog'sresolve">'''Frog:''' This sword...

Melchior repairs the sword, and Frog accompanies Crono as they set out to Magus's lair. They battle his three generals and confront the warlock in the process of casting a spell. Magus claims he did not create Lavos, who dwells within the planet to siphon its energy— but merely intended to summon it.<ref name="only-summoned">'''Magus:''' You fools! I only «summoned» him!

Crono and his friends awaken in 65,000,000 B.C.; after helping Ayla defeat the Reptites, they witness Lavos crash deep into the earth from above. Agreeing that Lavos is an extraterrestrial life-form, the group travels to the ancient, enlightened Kingdom of Zeal in 12,000 B.C. Zeal recently discovered Lavos and seeks to drain its power to achieve immortality through the Mammon Machine. A mysterious prophet warns the kingdom's queen about Crono, forcing their return to prehistory with no way back, by sealing the time gate they used to get there. In A.D. 2,300, they find a ship-like time machine called the Wings of Time (or ''Epoch''), which can access any time period without using a time gate.

They travel back to Zeal, where the Ocean Palace will soon be activated. Lavos awakens, disturbed by the Mammon Machine, and the prophet reveals himself to be Magus before attempting to kill the creature.<ref name="magusrevealed">'''Magus:''' I've waited for this...

He detains the group and impounds the Epoch, which his henchmen modify to fly.

==Development and releases==
''Chrono Trigger'' was produced by [[Kazuhiko Aoki]] while director credits were attributed to [[Akihiko Matsui]], [[Yoshinori Kitase]] and [[Takashi Tokita]].

===PlayStation release===

Square released an enhanced [[porting|port]] of ''Chrono Trigger'' developed by [[TOSE]] in Japan for the Sony PlayStation in 1999. Square timed its release before that of ''[[Chrono Cross]]'', the 1999 sequel to ''Chrono Trigger'', to give new players familiarity with the story of its predecessor.<ref name="ultimania" /> This version included [[anime]] cut scenes created by original character designer Akira Toriyama's [[Bird Studio]] and animated by [[Toei Animation]], as well as several bonus features, accessible after achieving various endings in the game. Scenarist Masato Kato attended planning meetings at Bird Studio to discuss how the ending cut scenes would illustrate subtle ties to ''[[Chrono Cross]]''.<ref name="ultimania" /> The port was later released in North America in 2001—along with a [[remaster]]ed version of ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''—under the package title ''[[Final Fantasy Chronicles]]''. Reviewers criticized ''Chronicles'' for lengthy load times and an absence of new in-game features.<ref name="loadtime" /><ref>{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy Chronicles Review for PlayStation | url=http://www.gaming-age.com/cgi-bin/reviews/review.pl?sys=psx&game=ffc | publisher=Gaming Age | accessdate=July 2 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

===DS release===<!--This section is linked from redirect [[Chrono Trigger DS]]--> 

On July 2, 2008, Square Enix announced that they were officially planning to bring ''Chrono Trigger'' to the [[Nintendo DS]] handheld platform.<ref name="DS">{{cite press release |title=CHRONO TRIGGER Returns!

According to a blog post on www.g4tv.com, the Nintendo DS version of ''Chrono Trigger'' has a new ending involving Crono, Marle, and Frog in front of a Time Portal.<ref>http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/690817/New_Ending_For_Chrono_Trigger_DS.html[http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/690817/New_Ending_For_Chrono_Trigger_DS.html]</ref>

The new features of the DS re-release include:
* The anime opening from the PlayStation version of the game plays when the game is loaded; this can be skipped by touching the bottom screen.
* The game can be played in either of two modes - 'DS Mode' and 'Classic Mode'. DS Mode allows for dual screen and touch screen gameplay (although the directional pad and buttons can still be used instead), while Classic Mode allows the game to be played in the style of the original SNES version. This setting is chosen at the beginning of a new game and can be altered later in the menu's settings.
* The game's settings have been expanded to allow for choosing between 'Walk' and 'Run' as an example, as well as containing several options exclusive to both DS and Classic modes.
* The game contains multiple new dungeons, including 'Dimensional Vortex' and 'Lost Sanctum'.
* Upon completion of the game, the 'Dimensional Vortex' is unlocked. This is an entirely new dungeon that contains multiple new bosses, and upon completion, a new final boss, whom beating gives a new ending.
* The anime sequences return from the PS version (note that the load times are gone). These can be switched off in the settings.
* The Japanese version of the game includes the English script as a selectable option in the settings. The game will automatically start in English if the DS console is set to that language. Note that no languages besides Japanese and English are included.
* The element 'Lightning' has become 'Light', to reflect the original name 'Heaven'.
* Party members' elements are now displayed with nameless icons (e.g. Water has a blue droplet) on the menu screen rather than an image with the element's name on it.
* Item name changes have been made to reflect the original Japanese version of Chrono Trigger - e.g. 'Tonic' has become 'Potion', and the various stat-enhancing 'Tab' items of the game have become 'Capsule' items (for example, 'Strength Capsule').
* The game's sprites and music have been noticably improved, although not vastly changed from the original. In some instances, different (albeit not new) sprite animations are used. An example of this is Robo and Frog's stances when entering a Gate.
* The character Magus, originally referred to as a 'dark wizard', is now referred to as the 'Fiendlord'; the race of creatures known as Mystics are now known as Fiends.
* The 'Arena' and 'Extras' features become unlocked upon saving the game once. These are accessed from the title screen.

'''Arena'''<br />
The Arena feature included in the DS port of the game is unlocked upon saving the game; it is accessed from the title screen menu. The location uses the Factory theme from 2300 AD as its music. Once the player enters, a man will greet them and explain that this 'Arena of the Ages' allows you to raise creatures that each correspond to one of the game's four elements (Light, Fire, Water, Shadow). After the man offers an explanation, the player is given a choice between four default basic creatures called 'Smidges'; each of them possess one of the four elements. The player can send their creature to any of the periods in time that they have visited for training; this will alter the creature's growth. Items can be bought from a Nu merchant in the Arena that enhance the training or battling aspects of a creature, as such unique items for each element exist. The player can also battle their creature against NPC character creatures - similar to Pokemon.

'''Extras'''<br />
The 'Extras' option appears on the title screen after saving the game once. It contains six accessible options and two hidden ones:
* Theater ('View in-game movies')
* Art Gallery ('View concept artwork')
* Music Box ('Listen to music tracks')
* Dojo ('View character tech skill information')
* Bestiary ('View detailed enemy information')
* Item Encyclopedia ('View item information')

These features are in the same vein as the extra options unlocked in the PS version.

The menu for the Extras also uses several new music tracks. It should be noted that these cannot be found immediately in the music box.

''Chrono Trigger'' was scored by [[Yasunori Mitsuda]] and veteran ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], with one track composed by both Uematsu and [[Noriko Matsueda]]. A sound programmer at the time, Mitsuda was unhappy with his pay and threatened to leave Square if he could not compose music.<ref name="powerup" /> Hironobu Sakaguchi suggested he score ''Chrono Trigger'', remarking, "maybe your salary will go up."<ref name="mitsuda2008" /> Mitsuda reflected, "I wanted to create music that wouldn't fit into any established genre...music of an imaginary world. The game's director, Masato Kato, was my close friend, and so I'd always talk with him about the setting and the scene before going into writing."<ref name="powerup" /> Mitsuda slept in his studio several nights, and attributed certain songs—such as ''To Far Away Times''—to inspiring dreams.<ref name="mitsuda2008" /> He also suffered a hard drive crash that lost around forty in-progress tracks.<ref name="famitsujuly2008">{{cite journal| year=2008 | journal=[[Famitsu]] | title=Chrono Trigger DS | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/July_2008_Weekly_Famitsu_Interview_with_Yasunori_Mitsuda.html   | pages=pp.&nbsp;67–70 | language=Japanese}}</ref> After Mitsuda contracted stomach ulcers, Uematsu joined the project to compose ten songs and finish the score.<ref name="powerup">{{Cite book | year=2004 | first=Chris |last=Kohler |authorlink=Chris Kohler | title=[[Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life]] | publisher=DK Publishing  | isbn=0-7440-0424-1}}</ref> Mitsuda returned to watch the ending with the staff before the game's release, crying upon seeing the finished scene.<ref name="famitsujuly2008" /> Mitsuda considers ''Chrono Trigger'' a landmark title which helped mature his talent.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://palgn.com.au/article.php?id=5478 |title=Yasunori Mitsuda Interview |accessdate=2007-05-22 | first=James |last=Gay | date=October 13, 2006 | publisher=PALGN}}</ref>

At the time of the game's release, the number of tracks and sound effects was unprecedented—the soundtrack spanned three discs in its 1995 commercial pressing.<ref name="npreview1" /> Square also released a one-disc [[acid jazz]] arrangement called "''[[The Brink of Time]]''" by [[Guido (jazz band)|Guido]] that year. In 1999, Square produced another one-disc soundtrack to complement the PlayStation release of ''Trigger'', featuring [[orchestra]]l tracks used in [[cut scene]]s. Yasunori Mitsuda also composed four new pieces for the game's bonus features which weren't included on the soundtrack.

''Chrono Trigger'' garnered much critical praise in addition to its brisk sales. ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' called it Square's "biggest game ever", citing improved graphics, sound, and gameplay over past RPG titles.

==Sequels==
''Chrono Trigger'' inspired several [[sequel]]s and expansion packs or add-ons; the first were three titles released for the [[Satellaview]] in 1995. They included ''Chrono Trigger: Jet Bike Special'', a [[racing game]] based on a [[minigame]] from the original; ''Chrono Trigger: Character Library'', featuring profiles on characters and monsters from the game; and ''Chrono Trigger: Music Library'', a collection of music from the game's soundtrack. The contents of ''Character Library'' and ''Music Library'' were later included as extras in the PlayStation rerelease of ''Chrono Trigger''. [[Production I.G]] created a 16-minute [[Original video animation|OVA]] entitled "''[[Nuumamonja: Time and Space Adventures]]''" broadcasted at the Japanese [[V-Jump]] Festival of July 31, 1996.<ref>{{cite web |title=時空冒険ぬうまもんじゃ～ |url=http://www.production-ig.co.jp/contents/works_sp/0330_/index.html |author=Production I.G staff |publisher=[[Production I.G]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Dimensional Adventure Numa Monjar |url=http://www.production-ig.com/contents/works/07_/000133.html |author=Production I.G staff |publisher=[[Production I.G]] |accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref>

Square released a fourth Satellaview game in 1996, named ''[[Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai Hōseki]]''. Feeling that ''Trigger'' ended with "unfinished business", scenarist Masato Kato wrote and directed the game.<ref name="ultimania" /> ''Dreamers'' functioned as a [[side story]] to ''Chrono Trigger'', resolving a loose subplot from its predecessor.<ref name="weeklyfamitsu">{{cite web | year=1999 | title=Weekly Famitsu | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Weekly_Famitsu.html | publisher=Chrono Compendium | accessmonthday=July 3 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> A short, [[Interactive fiction|text-based game]] relying on minimal graphics and atmospheric music, the game never received an official release outside Japan—though it was [[fan translation|translated]] by fans to English in April 2003.<ref name="fantranslation">{{cite web | date=April 15, 2003 | title=Chrono Trigger 2: Radical Dreamers | url=http://radicaldreamers.sourceforge.net/ | publisher=Demiforce | accessmonthday=July 2 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Square planned to release ''Radical Dreamers'' as an easter egg in the PlayStation edition of ''Chrono Trigger'', but Kato was unhappy with his work and halted its inclusion.<ref name="ultimania">{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Chrono Cross Ultimania | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Ultimania_Developer_Interviews.html | pages=pp.&nbsp;476–477 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | isbn=4-925075-73-X}}</ref>
