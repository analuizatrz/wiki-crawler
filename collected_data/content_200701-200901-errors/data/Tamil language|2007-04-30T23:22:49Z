'''Tamil''' ({{lang|ta|தமிழ்}} {{ISOtranslit|''tamiḻ''|ta}}; [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|/t̪ɐmɨɻ/}}) is a [[Dravidian language]] spoken predominantly by [[Tamil people|Tamils]] in [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]], with smaller communities of speakers in many other countries.  It is the official language of the Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]], and also has official status in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Singapore]].  With more than 77 million speakers,<ref name="vistawide"/> an [[Ancient Tamil country|ancient history]], a rich and continuous literature, and an international and modern presence, Tamil is one of the major languages of the world.  

Even though Tamil is characterised by its use of [[retroflex consonants]] similar to the other [[Dravidian languages]], it also uses an unique liquid l (ழ்). Tamil employs [[Agglutination|agglutinative]] grammar, where suffixes are used to mark [[noun class]], [[grammatical number|number]], and [[case]], verb [[grammatical tense|tense]] and other grammatical categories. Unlike most of the other Indian languages, [[metalanguage]] of Tamil, the language used to describe the technical linguistic terms of the language and its structure, is also Tamil<ref>A.K. Ramanujam and V. Dharwadker (Ed.), The collected essays of A.K. Ramanujam, Oxford University Press 2000, p.111</ref>. Tamil is  characterised by a marked [[diglossia]], with two basic styles and a continuum of intermediate styles which combine features from one or more of the basic styles.

[[Tamil literature]] has an literary tradition of more than two thousand years.  The earliest epigraphic records date to around 200 BCE<ref name="ucla200bc">{{cite web

==History==
[[Image:Christian prayers in tamil on palm leaves.jpg|thumb|A set of palm leaf manuscripts from the fifteenth century or the 16th century, containing [[Christianity|Christian]] [[prayer]]s in Tamil.]]
The origins of Tamil are not transparent, but it developed and flourished as an independent language with a rich literature in India for more than 2300 years. Tamil has the largest number of epigraphical inscriptions in India, estimated to be more than 55,000.<ref name="Largest number of insciptions">{{cite web |title= Students get glimpse of heritage |url= http://www.thehindu.com/2005/11/22/stories/2005112215970400.htm |author= Staff Reporter |publisher= The Hindu |date = [[November 22]] [[2005]] |accessdate= 2007-04-26}}</ref> Unlike in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh where early inscriptions were written in Sanskrit, the early inscriptions in Tamil nadu used Tamil exclusively. <ref name="caldwell1">{{cite book

Literary works in India were preserved either in [[palm leaf manuscript]]s (implying repeated copying and recopying) or through oral transmission, making direct dating impossible.<ref>Dating of Indian literature is largely based on relative dating relying on internal evidences with a few anchors. I. Mahadevan's dating of [[Pukalur]] inscription proves some of the Sangam verses. See George L. Hart, "Poems of Ancient Tamil, University of Berkeley Press, 1975, p.7-8 </ref> [[chronology|External chronological records]] and internal linguistic evidence, however, indicate that the oldest extant works were probably compiled sometime between the 2nd century BCE and the 3rd century CE.<ref name=hart1974>George Hart, "Some Related Literary Conventions in Tamil and Indo-Aryan and Their Significance" ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', 94:2 (Apr - Jun 1974), pp. 157-167.</ref><ref name=zvelebil1955>Kamil Veith Zvelebil, ''Companion Studies to the History of Tamil Literature'', pp12</ref><ref name=sastry1955>

Epigraphic attestation of Tamil begins with rock inscriptions from the 3rd century BCE, written in [[Tamil-Brahmi]], an adapted form of the [[Brahmi script]].<ref>Iravatham Mahadevan (2003). Early Tamil Epigraphy from the Earliest Times to the Sixth Century A.D. Cambridge, Harvard University Press.</ref> The earliest extant literary text is the [[Tolkāppiyam]], a work on poetics and grammar which describes the language of the classical period, [[Date_of_the_Tolkappiyam |dated variously between the 2nd BCE and 5th]] CE, the latest dates based on later redactions<ref>According to Hart (1975), the oldest portions  may date back to around 200 BCE</ref>. 

Tamil scholars categorise [[Tamil literature]] and language into the following periods: 
#[[Sangam literature|Sangam]] (200 BCE to 300 CE)
#Post-Sangam (300 to 700 CE) 
#Bhakthi period (700 to 1200 CE)
#Mediaeval Period (1200 to 1800 CE)
#Modern (1800 to the present)

The Sangam literature contains about 50,000 lines of poetry contained in 2381 poems attributed to 473 poets that includes many women poets.<ref>Rajam, V. S. 1992. A reference grammar of classical Tamil poetry: 150 B.C.-pre-fifth/sixth century A.D.. Memoirs of the American philosophical society, v. 199. Philadelphia, Pa: American Philosophical Society. p12</ref> Many of the poems of Sangam period were also set to music<ref>For example [[Paripaatal]] and [[Pathirruppaththu]]</ref>. During the post-Sangam period, important works like [[Thirukkural]], and epic poems like [[Cilappatikaram]], [[Manimekalai]], ''Cīvakacintāmani'' were composed. The Bhakthi period is known for the great outpouring of devotional songs set to [[pann]] music. Of those 9,295 Tevaram songs on [[Saivism]] and 4,000 songs on [[Vaishnavism]] are well known <ref>P.Ramanatha Pillai (Ed), Panniru thirumuraip perunthirattu (Tamil), Saiva Siddhanta Publishers, Chennai, 1961 p.3-4</ref>. The early Mediaeval Period gave rise to one of the  best known adaptations of the [[Ramayana]] in Tamil, known as Kampa Ramayanam and a story of 63 [[Nayanmars]] known as Periyapuranam.  

The initial development of Tamil is similar to that of other Dravidian languages and is independent of Sanskrit.<ref name="caldwell" /> It was little influenced by other languages such as [[Indo-Aryan languages]] up until the early medieval period.<ref>See Vaidyanathan's analysis of an early medieval text in S. Vaidyanathan, "Indo-Aryan loan words in the Civakacintamani" ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' 87:4. (Oct - Dec 1967), pp. 430-434.</ref> Although there had been mutual influence between Tamil and Sanskrit, it is believed by some  scholars that during later centuries, Tamil, along with other Dravidian languages like [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Kannada]], [[Malayalam]] etc., has been greatly influenced by [[Sanskrit]] in terms of vocabulary, grammar and literary styles.<ref name="influence">"Literature in all Dravidian languages owes a great deal to Sanskrit, the magic wand whose touch raised each of the languages from a level of patois to that of a literary idiom" (Sastri 1955, p309)</ref><ref name="caldwell">Caldwell, Robert. 1974.

==Classification==
Tamil belongs to the [[Southern Dravidian languages|southern]] branch of the [[Dravidian languages]]. It is sometimes classified as being part of a [[Tamil languages|Tamil language family]], which alongside Tamil proper, also includes the languages of about 35 ethno-linguistic groups<ref>Prof. A.K. Perumal, Manorama Yearbook (Tamil) 2005 pp.302-318 </ref> such as the [[Irula language|Irula]], [[Betta Kurumba language|Betta Kurumba]], [[Sholaga language|Sholaga]], and [[Yerukala language|Yerukula]] languages (see [[SIL Ethnologue]]). This group is a subgroup of the [[Tamil-Malayalam languages]], which falls under a subgroup of the [[Tamil-Kodagu languages]], which in turn is a subgroup of the [[Tamil-Kannada languages]].  The closest major relative of Tamil is Malayalam.

==Geographic distribution==
[[Image:Tamil speakers map.svg|thumb|Distribution of Tamil speakers in India and Sri Lanka]]
Tamil is the first language of the majority in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]] and [[North Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|North Eastern Province]], [[Sri Lanka]]. The language is spoken by small groups of minorities in other parts of these two countries such as [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], and [[Maharashtra]] in case of India and [[Colombo]] and the hill country in case of Sri Lanka.

There are currently sizeable [[Tamil diaspora|Tamil-speaking populations]] descended from colonial-era migrants in [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Asians in South Africa|South Africa]], and [[Mauritius]]. Many people in [[Guyana]], [[Fiji]], [[Suriname]], and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] have Tamil origins, but only a small number speak the language there. Groups of more recent migrants [[Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora|from Sri Lanka]] and India exist in [[Canada]] (especially [[Toronto]]), [[United States|USA]], [[Australia]], many [[Middle East]]ern countries, and most of the western [[Europe]]an countries.

===Legal status===
Tamil is the [[official Language]] of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Tamil is one of the official languages of the union territories of [[Puducherry]] and the [[Andaman & Nicobar Islands]]. It is one of 23 nationally recognised languages in the Constitution of [[India]]. Tamil is an official language of [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Singapore]]. It enjoys constitutional recognition in [[South Africa]], [[Mauritius]], and [[Malaysia]].

Tamil enjoys constitutional recognition in [[South Africa]], [[Mauritius]], and [[Malaysia]].-->

In addition, with the creation in 2004 of a legal status for classical languages by the [[government of India]], Tamil became the first legally recognised [[classical language]] following a campaign by several Tamil associations supported by academics from India and abroad, most notably Professor [[George L. Hart]], who occupies the Chair in Tamil Studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name="Hart statement">{{cite web |url= http://tamil.berkeley.edu/Tamil%20Chair/TamilClassicalLanguage/TamilClassicalLgeLtr.html |title= Statement on the Status of Tamil as a Classical Language |accessdate= 2007-04-04 |author= George Hart |date=[[April 11]] [[2000]] |work= Letter to the Indian Government regarding Tamil as a Classical Language |publisher= University of California, Berkeley}}</ref> The recognition was announced by the [[President of India]], Dr. [[Abdul Kalam]], in a joint sitting of both houses of the [[Parliament of India|Indian Parliament]] on [[June 6]], [[2004]].<ref name="Kalam speech">{{cite web

===Dialects===
Tamil dialects are mainly differentiated from each other by the fact that they have undergone different phonological changes and sound shifts in evolving from Old Tamil. For example, the word for "here" —''iṅku'' in ''Centamil'' (the classic variety)—has evolved into ''iṅkū'' in the Kongu dialect of [[Coimbatore]], ''inga'' in the dialect of [[Thanjavur]], ''iṅkane'' in the dialect of [[Tirunelveli]], ''iṅkuṭṭu'' in the dialect of [[Ramanathapuram]], ''iṅkale'' and ''iṅkaṭe'' in various northern dialects and ''iṅkai'' in some [[Sri Lankan Tamil dialects|dialects of Sri Lanka]].

Although most Tamil dialects do not differ very significantly in their vocabulary, there are a few exceptions. The dialects spoken in [[Sri Lanka]] retain many words and grammatical forms that are not in everyday use in [[India]],<ref>Thomas Lehmann, "Old Tamil" in Sanford Steever (ed.), ''The Dravidian Languages'' Routledge, 1998 at p. 75; E. Annamalai and S. Steever, "Modern Tamil" in ibid. at pp. 100-128.
</ref> and use many other words slightly differently.<ref>Kamil Zvelebil, "Some features of Ceylon Tamil" ''Indo-Iranian Journal'' 9:2 (June 1996) pp. 113-138.</ref> The dialect of the [[Iyer]]s of [[Palakkad]] has a large number of [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] loanwords, has also been influenced by Malayalam syntax and also has a distinct Malayalam accent. [[Hebbar Iyengars|Hebbar]] and [[Mandyam]] dialects, spoken by groups of Tamil [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavites]] who migrated to [[Karnataka]] in the eleventh century, retain many features of the ''Vaishnava paribasai'', a special form of Tamil developed in the ninth and tenth centuries that reflect Vaishnavite religious and spiritual values.<ref>Thiru. Mu. Kovintācāriyar, ''Vāḻaiyaṭi vāḻai'' Lifco, Madras, 1978 at pp. 26-39.</ref> Several [[caste]]s have their own [[sociolect]]s which most members of that caste traditionally used regardless of where they come from.

The [[Ethnologue]] lists twenty-two current dialects of Tamil, including [[Adi Dravida]], [[Iyer|Aiyar]], [[Iyengar|Aiyangar]], Arava, Burgandi, Kasuva, Kongar, Korava, Korchi, Madrasi, Parikala, Pattapu Bhasha, [[SLT dialects|Sri Lanka Tamil]], Malaya Tamil, Burma Tamil, South Africa Tamil, [[Tigala|Tigalu]], Harijan, [[Sankethi language|Sankethi]], [[Hebbar Iyengars|Hebbar]], Tirunelveli, [[Tamil Muslim]]  and Madurai. Although not a dialect, the Tamil spoken in [[Chennai]] (Capital of Tamil Nadu) infuses [[English Language|English]] words and is called [[Madras Bashai]].<ref name=ananthalaksmibashai>{{cite news

===Spoken and literary variants===
[[Image:Genesis in a Tamil bible from 1723.jpg|left|thumb|The opening of the book of Genesis in an 18th century Tamil [[bible]]. The language is centamil.]]
In addition to its various dialects, Tamil exhibits different forms: a classical literary style modelled on the ancient language (''caṅkattamiḻ''), a modern literary and formal style (''centamiḻ''), and a modern [[colloquial]] form (''koṭuntamiḻ''). These styles shade into each other, forming a stylistic continuum. For example, it is possible to write ''centamiḻ'' with a vocabulary drawn from ''caṅkattamiḻ'', or to use forms associated with one of the other variants while speaking ''koṭuntamiḻ''.<ref>Harold Schiffman, "[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/messeas/diglossia/handbuk.html Diglossia as a Sociolinguistic Situation]", in Florian Coulmas (ed.), ''The Handbook of Sociolinguistics''. London: Basil Blackwell, Ltd., 1997 at pp. 205 et seq.</ref>

In modern times, ''centamiḻ'' is generally used in formal writing and speech. For instance, it is the language of textbooks, of much of [[Tamil literature]] and of public speaking and debate. In recent times, however, ''koṭuntamiḻ'' has been making inroads into areas that have traditionally been considered the province of ''centamiḻ''. Most contemporary [[film|cinema]], [[theatre]] and popular entertainment on television and radio, for example, is in ''koṭuntamiḻ'', and many [[politician]]s use it to bring themselves closer to their audience.  The increasing use of ''koṭuntamiḻ'' in modern times has led to the emergence of unofficial 'standard' spoken dialects. In [[India]], the 'standard' ''koṭuntamiḻ'' is based on 'educated non-brahmin speech', rather than on any one dialect,<ref>Harold Schiffman, "Standardization or restandardization: The case for 'Standard' Spoken Tamil". ''Language in Society'' 27 (1998), pp. 359–385.</ref> but has been significantly influenced by the dialects of [[Thanjavur]] and [[Madurai]]. In [[Sri Lanka]] the standard is based on the dialect of [[Jaffna]].

==Writing system==
{{main|Tamil script}}
[[Image:History of Tamil script.jpg|thumb|right|History of Tamil script.]]
Tamil is written using a script called the ''vaṭṭeḻuttu'', an [[abugida]] belonging to the [[Brahmic family]]. The Tamil script consists of 12 [[vowel]]s, 18 [[consonant]]s and one special character, the ''āytam''. The vowels and consonants combine to form 216 compound characters, giving a total of 247 characters. As with other [[Indic scripts]], all consonants have an inherent vowel ''a'', which in Tamil, is removed by adding an overdot called a ''puḷḷi'', to the consonantal sign. Unlike most Indic scripts, the Tamil script does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced [[plosive]]s.  Instead, plosives are articulated with voice or unvoiced depending on their position in a word, in accordance with the rules of [[Tamil phonology]], as discussed below.

The Tamil script evolved from a variant of the Asokan [[Brahmi]] script, called [[Tamil-Brahmi]] or Tamili, which differed from Asokan Brahmi in a number of ways. By the 9th century, Tamil-Brahmi had evolved into more rounded characters, called ''[[vatteluttu]]'' (meaning ''curved letters''), from which the modern script evolved.  In the 18th century, some changes were made to the script by the Italian missionary Constanzo Beschi, known in Tamil as [[Veeramamunivar]], to make it easier to print.  These included placing vowel markers in both the left and right of the consonants. Around 1935, [[E.V.Ramaswamy Periyar]] suggested some further changes to make it amenable to [[printing]].<ref name=periyar>{{cite web

[[Image:Vatteluttu2.png|thumb|left|An eleventh century ''vaṭṭeḻuttu'' inscription, from the [[Brihadisvara temple]] in [[Thanjavur]]]]In addition to the standard characters, six characters taken from the [[Grantha]] script, which was used in the Tamil region to write Sanskrit, are sometimes used to represent sounds not native to Tamil, that is, words borrowed from Sanskrit, Prakrit and other languages. The traditional system of writing loan-words, which involved respelling them in accordance with Tamil phonology remains. <ref>As recommended in the traditional grammar, the Tolkāppiyam.  ''See'' Tolkāppiyam, Nūrpā 401, "vadacol kiLavi vadavezuttu oriii"; in Tamil, "வடசொற் கிளவி வடவெழுத் தொரீஇ" This rule is in the Chapter on ''col'' ("word"), in the Section for ''eccaviyal;;, எச்சவியல்" ("extra items" )</ref>

{{main|Tamil phonology}}

Tamil phonology is characterised by the presence of [[retroflex consonant]]s, and strict rules for the distribution within words of voiced and unvoiced [[plosive]]s. Tamil phonology permits few consonant clusters, which can never be word initial. Native grammarians classify Tamil phonemes into vowels, consonants, and a "secondary character", the āytam.

===Vowels===
Tamil vowels are called ''uyireḻuttu'' (''uyir'' - life, ''eḻuttu'' - letter). The vowels are classified into short (''kuṟil'') and long (five of each type) and two [[diphthong]]s, /ai/ and /au/, and three "shortened" (''kuṟṟiyal'') vowels.

The long (''neṭil'') vowels are about twice as long as the short vowels. The [[diphthong]]s are usually pronounced about 1.5 times as long as the short vowels, though most grammatical texts place them with the long vowels.

===Consonants===
Tamil [[consonants]] are known as ''meyyeḻuttu'' (''mey''—body, ''eḻuttu''—letters). The [[consonant]]s are classified into three categories with six in each category: ''valliṉam''—hard, ''melliṉam''—soft or [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]], and ''iṭayiṉam''—medium. 

Unlike most Indian languages, Tamil does not have [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] consonants. In addition, the voicing of [[plosive]]s is governed by strict rules in ''centamiḻ''. Plosives are unvoiced if they occur word-initially or doubled. Elsewhere they are voiced, with a few becoming [[fricative]]s [[intervocalic]]ally. [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]s and [[Approximant consonant|approximant]]s are always voiced.<ref>''See e.g.'' the pronunciation guidelines in G.U. Pope (1868). ''A Tamil hand-book, or, Full introduction to the common dialect of that language''. (3rd ed.). Madras, Higginbotham & Co.</ref>

The sounds {{IPA|/ʂ/, /ɕ/}} are peripheral to the phonology of Tamil, being found only in loanwords and frequently replaced by native sounds. There are well-defined rules for elision in Tamil categorised into different classes based on the phoneme which undergoes elision.

===Aytam===
Classical Tamil also had a phoneme called the ''[[Āytham|āytam]]'', written as 'ஃ'. Tamil grammarians of the time classified it as a special character (''cārpeḻuttu''), but which is very rare in modern Tamil. The rules of pronunciation given in the Tolkāppiyam, a text on the grammar of Classical Tamil, suggest that the ''āytam'' could have [[Glottal stop|glottalised]] the sounds it was combined with. It has also been suggested that the ''āytam'' was used to represent the [[Implosive consonant|voiced implosive]] (or closing part or the first half) of geminated voiced plosives inside a word.<ref>''See generally'' F. B. J. Kuiper, "Two problems of old Tamil phonology", ''Indo-Iranian Journal'' 2:3 (September 1958) pp. 191-224, esp. pp. 191-207.</ref>

==Grammar==
{{main|Tamil grammar}}
Much of Tamil [[grammar]] is extensively described in the oldest known grammar book for Tamil, the ''[[Tolkāppiyam]]''. Modern Tamil writing is largely based on the 13th century grammar ''Naṉṉūl''  which restated and clarified the rules of the ''Tolkāppiyam'', with some modifications. Traditional Tamil grammar consists of five parts, namely ''eḻuttu'', ''col'', ''poruḷ'', ''yāppu'', ''aṇi''. Of these, the last two are mostly applied in poetry.

Similar to other Dravidian languages, Tamil is an [[agglutinative language]]. Tamil words consist of a [[lexeme|lexical root]] to which one or more [[affix]]es are attached. Most Tamil affixes are [[suffix]]es. Tamil suffixes can be ''[[Derivation (linguistics)|derivational]] suffixes'', which either change the part of speech of the word or its meaning, or ''[[inflection]]al suffixes'', which mark categories such as [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]], [[Grammatical tense|tense]], etc. There is no absolute limit on the length and extent of [[agglutination]], which can lead to long words with a large number of suffixes.

===Morphology===
Tamil nouns (and pronouns) are classified into two super-classes (''tiṇai'')—the "[[rational]]" (''uyartiṇai''), and the "[[irrational]]" (''aḵṟiṇai'')—which include a total of five classes (''pāl'', which literally means 'gender'). [[Human]]s and [[deity|deities]] are classified as "rational", and all other nouns ([[animal]]s, objects, abstract nouns) are classified as irrational. The "[[rational]]" nouns and pronouns belong to one of three classes (''pāl'')—masculine singular, feminine singular, and rational plural. The "[[irrational]]" nouns and pronouns belong to one of two classes - irrational singular and irrational plural. The ''pāl'' is often indicated through suffixes. The plural form for rational nouns may be used as an [[honorific]], gender-neutral, singular form.

Suffixes are used to perform the functions of [[case]]s or [[postposition]]s. Traditional grammarians tried to group the various suffixes into eight cases corresponding to the cases used in [[Sanskrit]]. These were the [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[dative case|dative]], [[sociative case|sociative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]], [[locative case|locative]], and [[ablative case|ablative]]. Modern grammarians, argue that this classification is artificial, and that Tamil usage is best understood if each suffix or combination of suffixes is seen as marking a separate case.<ref>Harold Schiffman, "Standardization and Restandardization: the case of Spoken Tamil." ''Language in Society'' 27:3 (1998) pp. 359-385 and esp. pp.374-375.</ref> Tamil nouns can take one of four [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]]es, ''i'', ''a'', ''u'' and ''e'' which are functionally equivalent to the demonstratives in [[English language|English]].

Tamil [[verb]]s are also inflected through the use of suffixes. A typical Tamil verb form will have a number of [[suffix]]es, which show person, number, mood, tense and voice.
*Person and number are indicated by [[suffix]]ing the [[oblique case]] of the relevant [[pronoun]] (''ēn'' in the above example). The suffixes to indicate tenses and voice are formed from [[grammatical particle]]s, which are added to the stem.
*Tamil has two voices. The first indicates that the subject of the sentence ''undergoes'' or ''is the object of'' the action named by the verb stem, and the second indicates that the subject of the sentence ''directs'' the action referred to by the verb stem.
*Tamil has three simple tenses—past, present, and future—indicated by the suffixes, as well as a series of perfects indicated by compound suffixes. Mood is implicit in Tamil, and is normally reflected by the same [[morpheme]]s which mark tense categories.

Tamil does not distinguish [[adjective]]s and [[adverb]]s.Both of them fall under the category ''uriccol''.

Tamil has no [[article (grammar)|article]]s. Definiteness and indefiniteness are either indicated by special grammatical devices, such as using the number "one" as an indefinite article, or by the context.

In the first person plural, Tamil makes a distinction between [[inclusive we|inclusive]] pronouns ''நாம்'' (nām) (we), ''நமது'' (namatu) (our) that include the addressee and [[exclusive we|exclusive]] pronouns ''நாங்கள்'' (nāṅkaḷ) (we), ''எமது'' (ematu) (our) that do not. The bifurcation of the First Person Plural pronoun (we in English) into inclusive and exclusive versions can be found in [[Inclusive and exclusive we|other languages]] too.

===Syntax===
Tamil is a consistently head-final language. The verb comes at the end of the clause, with typical word order [[Subject Object Verb]] (SOV). Tamil has [[postposition]]s rather than [[prepositions]]. Demonstratives and modifiers precede the noun within the noun phrase. Subordinate clauses precede the verb of the matrix clause.

However, Tamil also exhibits extensive ''scrambling'' (word order variation), so that surface permutations of the SOV order are possible with different [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] effects. 

Tamil is a [[null subject language]]. Not all Tamil sentences have subjects, verbs and objects. It is possible to construct valid sentences that have only a verb—such as ''muṭintuviṭṭatu'' ("completed")—or only a subject and object, without a verb such as ''atu eṉ vīṭu'' ("That, my house"). Tamil does not have a [[copula]] (a linking verb equivalent to the word ''is''). The word is included in the translations only to convey the meaning more easily.

==Vocabulary==
{{seealso|Wiktionary:Category:Tamil language|Wiktionary:Category:Tamil derivations}}
A strong sense of [[linguistic purism]] is found in Modern Tamil.<ref>Sumathi Ramaswamy, En/Gendering Language: The Poetics of Tamil Identity" ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' 35:4. (Oct. 1993), pp. 683-725.</ref> Much of the modern vocabulary derives from classical Tamil,<ref>For example Cre-A's Modern Tamil Dictionary contains 15,875 words, of which only a small percentage of words, some with Grantha letters are loan words.</ref> as well as governmental and non-governmental institutions, such as the [[Government of Sri Lanka]], the [[Tamil Virtual University]], and [[Annamalai University]]. 

These institutions have generated technical dictionaries for Tamil containing [[neologisms]] and words derived from Tamil roots to replace loan words from English and other languages. Since  mediaeval times, there has been a strong resistance to the use of Sanskrit words in Tamil<ref>Sumathi Ramaswamy, "Language of the People in the World of Gods: Ideologies of Tamil before the Nation" ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', 57:1. (Feb. 1998), pp. 66-92.</ref> This resistance is demonstrated by both the general population and community leaders.  An example of this would be political leader [[Jeevanandham]], who declared his name as "Uyirinban" (the literal translation of "Jeevanandham") in protest of the Sanskrit influence in the Tamil language.   

As a result, the Prakrit and Sanskrit loan words used in modern Tamil are, unlike in some other Dravidian languages, restricted mainly to some spiritual terminology and [[abstract noun]]s.<ref>Dr.T.P. Meenakshisundaram, A History of Tamil Language, Sarvodaya Ilakkiya Pannai, 1982 (translated) p. 241-2</ref> Besides Sanskrit, there are a few loan words from Persian and Arabic implying there were trade ties in ancient times.<ref name="Veliath001">[[Silapadhigaaram]], [[Manimekalai]], P.T.Srinivasa Iyengar's "History of the Tamils: from the earliest times to 600 AD", Madras, 1929</ref> Many [[List of loan words in Sri Lankan Tamil|loan words from Portuguese and Dutch]] and English were introduced into colloquial and written Tamil during the colonial period. 

Words of Tamil origin occur in other languages. Popular [[Words of Tamil origin|examples in English]] are cash (in the sense of a small Asian coin), cheroot (''curuṭṭu'' meaning "rolled up"),<ref name="OED">{{cite web
