'''Brian Keith Urlacher''' (born [[May 25]], [[1978]]) is an [[American football]] player for the [[Chicago Bears]] of the [[National Football League]]. Urlacher, a five-time [[Pro Bowl]] player, has established himself as one of the NFL's most productive [[linebackers]]. He is regarded as one of the best defensive players in the NFL, winning the [[NFL Rookie of the Year Award|NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year Award]] in 2000 and the [[NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award]] in 2005, becoming only the fifth player in NFL history to win both awards,<ref name="chicagobearsurlacher">{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagobears.com/team/player.asp?player_id=79|title=Chicago Bears Roster — Brian Urlacher|language=English}}</ref> and anchoring the Bears' defense that set several defensive records during his stint.<ref name="chicagobearsurlacher">{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagobears.com/team/player.asp?player_id=79|title=Chicago Bears Roster — Brian Urlacher|language=English}}</ref> His leadership and aggressive playing style have made him a quintessential icon for the Chicago Bears.

==Early life==
Brian Urlacher was born to Brad and Lavoyda Urlacher in [[Pasco, Washington]]. The family broke apart in the late [[1980s]], and Lavoyda gained [[custody]] of Urlacher and his siblings.<ref name="JockBio_Brian_Urlacher">{{cite web |url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Urlacher/Urlacher_bio.html|title=JockBio: Brian Urlacher|language=English}}</ref> Lavoyda then moved the family to [[Lovington, New Mexico]], where she was eager to give the family a new start. While his mother worked several jobs to keep the family afloat, Urlacher spent his free time exercising or playing various sports. Over time, Urlacher developed a sincere interest in [[football]]. Urlacher combined his brute force, agility, and speed to lead the Lovington High School Wild Cats to a 14-0 season. Urlacher established himself as a threat in all three phases of the game.<ref name="chicagobearsurlacher">{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagobears.com/team/player.asp?player_id=79|title=Chicago Bears Roster — Brian Urlacher|language=English}}</ref>

==College career==
[[Image:BrianUNM.JPG|thumb|right|210px|Urlacher sets a weight lifting record at the [[University of New Mexico]]]]
Although Urlacher was partial to attending [[Texas Tech University]], his dreams were cut short after the university failed to offer him a much-needed [[athletic scholarship|scholarship]]. The only two [[Division I]] schools that expressed genuine interests in him were the [[University of New Mexico]] and [[New Mexico State University|New Mexico State]]. Urlacher ultimately chose to attend the University of New Mexico.<ref name="JockBio_Brian_Urlacher">{{cite web |url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Urlacher/Urlacher_bio.html|title=JockBio: Brian Urlacher|language=English}}</ref> After playing only limited time during his early years at the University of New Mexico, Urlacher was converted into a [[linebacker]]. [[Dennis Franchione]], the head coach of New Mexico’s football team, had left the team in much disarray after hoping to reconstruct the team. Franchione heavily relied on his [[upperclassmen]] to do his bidding on the football field, and often left Urlacher sidelined during most games.<ref name="JockBio_Brian_Urlacher">{{cite web |url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Urlacher/Urlacher_bio.html|title=JockBio: Brian Urlacher|language=English}}</ref> After a well-fought season, the University of New Mexico lost a decisive game to the  [[Colorado State University]]. Despite the loss, the team was invited to play in the [[Insight.com Bowl]], where they lost to the [[University of Arizona]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailylobo.com/media/storage/paper344/news/2003/01/21/Sports/Lobo-Fans.Crowd.Bowl.Game-348067.shtml?norewrite200612071906&sourcedomain=www.dailylobo.com
|title=Lobo fans crowd bowl game|language=English}}</ref> Following the 1997 season, Franchione then left the University of New Mexico, and was replaced by [[Rocky Long]], the former defensive coordinator of [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. While Long failed to distinguish the University of New Mexico as a premier football team, he helped Urlacher earn nationwide attention. By being used as a free safety, receiver, and return specialist, Urlacher was able to re-enter the football scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://golobos.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/long_rocky00.html|title=Player Bio:Rocky Long|language=English}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unmalumni.com/mirage/fall2004/bighitter_print.htm
|title=The Big Hitter|language=English}}</ref>  Despite having to cope with a losing season, Urlacher had finished his college football career as one of the most talented prospects in the nation. <ref>{{cite web|url=

==Professional career==
===On the rise===
During the [[2000 NFL Draft]], Urlacher was selected by the [[Chicago Bears]] in the first round. Early in the season, Urlacher briefly lost his starting position to [[Rosevelt Colvin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCL/is_6_31/ai_81789945
|title=Meet Urlacher's trusty sidekick - Rising Star: Rosevelt Colvin|language=English}}</ref>
However, an [[injury]] to [[Barry Minter]] forced Urlacher to fill in as the team’s starting middle linebacker. After a productive performance against the [[New York Giants]], he became an instant hit, recording over 15 tackles in each of his next two games. Not even a minor injury could prevent Urlacher from claiming the [[2000]] [[NFL Rookie of the Year Award ]], along with an invite to his first [[Pro Bowl]]. Over the next two years, Urlacher distinguished himself as one of the league's most productive linebackers by recording 313 tackles, fourteen sacks and five interceptions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2002/12/29/Bucs/High_profile____Brian.shtml|title= High profile -- Brian Urlacher|language=English}}</ref>

Under the leadership of new coach [[Dick Jauron]], the Bears surprised many with their performance during the [[2001 NFL season]]. Urlacher helped lead the Bears to three come from behind victories, and two shut-outs. During week fifteen of the 2001 season, a fake field goal allowed Bears' punter [[Brad Maynard]] to throw a game winning touchdown pass to Urlacher, giving the Bears the [[National Football Conference]]'s number two playoff seed. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A18019-2001Dec23|title=Redskins Fall From Race|language=English}}</ref> Despite their extremely productive defense, the Bears lost the divisional playoffs to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. Unfortunately, the Bears’ 2001 winning season would soon be overshadowed by three years of mediocrity.  Prior to the [[2004 NFL season]], the Bears’ organization fired coach [[Dick Jauron]], and then hired [[Lovie Smith]]. After starting the season on the lower rungs of the [[NFC North]], Urlacher suffered several injuries, which sidelined him for a majority of the season. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/sport_story_skin/465927?format=html

===Monster of the midway===

Despite starting the [[2005 NFL season]] on a disastrous note, the Bears rebound by winning eight straight games, and eventually clinching a playoff berth against the [[Green Bay Packers]] on [[Christmas Day]]. Urlacher played crucial role in the Bears' playoff berth; he recorded at least ten tackles in six consecutive games, while leading the team with 121 tackles. Additionally, his leadership and seasoned judgment allowed the Bears' defense to allow the fewest points in the league.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.actasports.com/sow.php?id=72|title=The best defense of all time?|language=English}}</ref> By the time the season ended, Urlacher and the Bears had boasted the best league's defense in the entire [[NFL]]. Before the regular season’s end, Urlacher was awarded with the [[NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award]], and an invitation to the Pro Bowl. Urlacher, who ranked among the league's top defensive tiers, received more votes than any other defensive player in the NFL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicago.about.com/od/sportsrecreation/a/122505_Bears.htm
|title=Six Chicago Bears Named to 2006 Pro Bowl|language=English}}</ref>
The following week, the [[Carolina Panthers]] defeated the Bears with a score of 29-21 in the divisional playoffs. 

The Bears started the [[2006 Chicago Bears season|2006 season]] by winning nine out of eleven games. Urlacher had a prodigious performance against the [[Arizona Cardinals]] during a week six [[Monday Night Football]] game. After trailing the Cardinals by twenty points, Urlacher helped the Bears engineer a late comeback, by stripping the ball from [[Edgerrin James]], which lead to a pivotal Bears’ recovery and touchdown. The Bears went on to win, 24-23, while Urlacher recorded eighteen total tackles (ten solo).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=2561
|title=Lightning strikes twice for Urlacher|language=English}}</ref>
Later, he went on to overcome a "sprained toe" injury to lead the Bears to a 38-20 victory over the [[New York Giants]], and made an interception in the end-zone the following week to solidify a [[shutout]] against the [[New York Jets]].<ref>[http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=2695 Bears catch up to Jets' no-huddle offense] by ''Larry Mayer'' of Chicagobears.com, posted 19 November, 2006.</ref> Urlacher and the Bears concluded the season with a 13-3 record, and the [[NFC]]’s top playoff seed. Urlacher was selected as the NFC’s starting middle linebacker in the [[2007 Pro Bowl]], and was named onto the [[Associated Press]]’s "2006 All-Pro Team". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=2825

=== Reputation ===
Following his successful rookie season, Urlacher was able to fetch a healthy popularity within the [[Chicagoland]] area. Undoubtedly, he is still one of the most popular current Chicago Bears players. Bears’ fans consider Urlacher to be one of the "[[Monsters of the Midway]]", a "[[Valhalla]]" of Bears’ icons including [[Dick Butkus]], [[Mike Ditka]], and [[Mike Singletary|“Samurai” Mike Singletary]]. On a national level, Urlacher’s jersey sales have rivaled those of other NFL icons, such as [[Michael Vick]] and [[Brett Favre]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://football.about.com/cs/footballapparel/tp/2002playjersey.htm|title=Top 10 NFL Player Jerseys|language=English}}</ref> Football fans across the nation have also voted Urlacher into five [[Pro Bowls]]. However, some skeptics and critics have considered Urlacher to be overrated. Urlacher’s injury woes in 2004 caused ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' columnist [[Jay Mariotti]] to name him the NFL’s most overrated player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suntimes.com/sports/mariotti/116332,CST-SPT-jay30.articlel|title='Overrated' Urlacher could be NFL MVP|language=English}}</ref> Even after recovering from his injury, and winning the [[NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award]] for the [[2005 NFL season|2005]] season, a 2006  ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' poll of 361 NFL players named Urlacher to be the second most overrated player in the league, behind [[Terrell Owens]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nfl.aolsportsblog.com/2006/10/31/overrated-terrell-owens-brian-urlacher-and-tom-brady/|title= Overrated: Terrell Owens, Brian Urlacher ... and Tom Brady?|language=English}}</ref> Urlacher was unfazed by the poll’s results. During an interview, he said, "Just watch the film. I don’t know what people are saying, but I’m not too worried about it anymore. All I can do is go out there and play hard and try and help my team win, and that’s what I’m going to keep doing." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=2603|title=Adversity not slowing Urlacher's meteoric rise|language=English}}</ref>



==Personal life==

Although Urlacher may appear to be intimidating, his teammates often criticize him for not being “mean” enough <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Urlacher/Urlacher_bio.html|title=JockBio: Brian Urlacher|language=English}}</ref>. Urlacher has a soft side, which is often exposed through his compassion for helping others. In 2002, Brian Urlacher appeared on ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', and won over $47,000, which he donated to charity. Urlacher, along with other Chicago Bears players, have sold autographed sports memorabilia to help fund the [[Special Olympics]]. Furthermore, Urlacher has been involved with charity work since his days at the University of New Mexico, where he volunteered countless hours for the [[Special Olympics]] and [[Ronald McDonald House]].

Urlacher was married, but later divorced by his ex-wife, Laure. While married to Laure, the couple had one daughter named Pamela. After the divorce, Urlacher briefly dated [[Paris Hilton]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://50.lycos.com/111103.asp|title=A Royal Disaster|language=English}}</ref>. Urlacher's younger brother, [[Casey Urlacher]], lived with him before beginning his professional career in the [[Arena Football League]]. Urlacher currently lives with his two children, Pamela and Riley, while occasionally hosting Kennedy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbs2chicago.com/sports/local_story_292135420.html|title=Bitter Custody Battle May Be Over For Urlacher|language=English}}</ref>
[[image:Urlachergc.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Brian Urlacher on the Cover of ''ESPN NFL 2K3'']]
In June 2005, Urlacher filed suit to establish paternity of a child, Kennedy. [[Genetic testing]] was completed to prove that he is the father. Although Urlacher was more than willing to help the child, he was worried about supplying money to the mother, [[Tyna Robertson]]. A former [[stripper]], Robertson was already well-known to the [[Mass media|media]], having made unsuccessful claims of sexual assault against famed dancer [[Michael Flatley]] and a doctor from [[Naperville, Illinois]]. Both cases were thrown out, and Flatley is in the process of counter-suing Robertson for defamation of character. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailysouthtown.com/news/115725,2NWS5-29.article|title=Who is Tyna?|language=English}}</ref>In [[October]] of [[2006]], Urlacher became invigorated after Robertson refused to drive Kennedy to Urlacher’s house in [[Lake Bluff, Illinois]]. He took Robertson to court in order to resolve Kennedy’s custody dispute. Ultimately, the judge decided it would be best for Urlacher and Robertson to meet between a halfway point during exchanges for the benefit of both parents and Kennedy. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbs2chicago.com/sports/local_story_292135420.html|title=Bitter Custody Battle May Be Over For Urlacher|language=English}}</ref>

Urlacher is also a prosperous businessman. He is the owner of an [http://www.travelingusa.com/business/brianurlachercrosscountryautotucumcari/index.html?from_cat=Rentals%20and%20Dealerships auto dealership] in [[Lovington, New Mexico]], and has appeared in several commercials for [[McDonald's]], [[Domino's Pizza]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], and [[Campbell's]] [[Chunky soup]]. Nike aired special commercials about Urlacher's high school career which contained clips and commentary of great plays he made in high school. However, Urlacher would later go on to say that he feels "uncomfortable" appearing in commercials <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Urlacher/Urlacher_mysay.html|title=JockBio: Brian Urlacher "My Say"|language=English}}</ref>. Urlacher was also the cover athlete and spokesperson for [[Sega|Sega Sports']] ''[[ESPN NFL 2K|NFL 2K3]]''. Outside of football, Urlacher is a die-hard [[Chicago Cubs]] fan, and was once invited to sing ''[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]'' during the [[Seventh-inning stretch]].  He also enjoys watching [[professional wrestling]], and even wrestled under the name “The Worm”. When the Bears' organization discovered this, they forced Urlacher to stop wrestling. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Urlacher/Urlacher_numbers.html|title=JockBio: Brian Urlacher Facts|language=English}}</ref>

Urlacher enjoys golfing during his spare time. During an episode of ''[[AT&T]]’s Home Turf'', Urlacher revealed a room in his mansion which contained a plethora of golf paraphernalia. When home, Urlacher revealed that he enjoys watching the [[Discovery Channel]], [[National Geographic]], and [[HBO]]’s ''[[Entourage]]''. Urlacher enjoys listening to a wide variety of music, including [[hip-hop]], [[rap]], [[rock (music)|rock]], and [[country music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seehowtheylive.com/bUrlacher.php|title=AT&T's Home Turf|language=English}}</ref>
