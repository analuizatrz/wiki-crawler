A '''chiton''' ([[Ancient Greek]] ''khitōn'') was a form of clothing in [[Ancient Greece]], worn by both women and men. A large belt, called the ''zoster'' could be worn over the chiton, usually under the breast ("high-girded") or around the waist ("low-girded"). A double-girded style also existed. The chiton was often worn in combination with the heavier [[himation]], which had the role of a cloak. When used alone (without a himation), the chiton was called a ''monochiton''. A long chiton which reached the heels was called a ''chiton poderes'', while a longer one which dragged the ground was called a ''chiton syrtos''.

It was the outfit of [[Aphrodite]] because it was considered very feminine, although men also wore it. [[Dionysus]] is often depicted wearing it. The chiton was also worn by the Romans, who referred to it as a ''tunica''.
