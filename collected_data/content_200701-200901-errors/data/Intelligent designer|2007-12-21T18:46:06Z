An '''intelligent designer''', also referred to as an '''intelligent agent''', is the willed and self-conscious entity that the [[intelligent design movement]] argues had some role in the [[origin of life|origin]] and/or development of life and who supposedly has left scientific evidence of this [[intelligent design]]. They also use the term "intelligent cause" implying their [[teleology|teleological]] supposition of direction and purpose in features of the universe and of living things.
The intelligent design movement is a [[neo-creationist]] campaign that arose out of the previous [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist]] and [[evangelism|evangelistic]] [[creation science]] movement.<ref>[[wikisource:Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District/2:Context|Ruling, Context]] [[Kitzmiller v.

However, as Dr. Haught testified, anyone familiar with Western religious thought would immediately make the association that the tactically unnamed designer is God, as the description of the designer in Of Pandas and People (hereinafter "Pandas") is a "master intellect," strongly suggesting a supernatural deity as opposed to any intelligent actor known to exist in the natural world. (P-11 at 85). Moreover, it is notable that both Professors Behe and Minnich admitted their personal view is that the designer is God and Professor Minnich testified that he understands many leading advocates of ID to believe the designer to be God. (21:90 (Behe); 38:36-38 (Minnich)). Although proponents of the IDM occasionally suggest that the designer could be a space alien or a time-traveling cell biologist, no serious alternative to God as the designer has been proposed by members of the IDM, including Defendants' expert witnesses. (20:102-03 (Behe)). In fact, an explicit concession that the intelligent designer works outside the laws of nature and science and a direct reference to religion is Pandasâ€™ rhetorical statement, "what kind of intelligent agent was it [the designer]" and answer: "On its own science cannot answer this question. It must leave it to religion and philosophy." (P-11 at 7; 9:13-14 (Haught)). A significant aspect of the IDM is that despite Defendants' protestations to the contrary, it describes ID as a religious argument. In that vein, the writings of leading ID proponents reveal that the designer postulated by their argument is the God of Christianity." [[wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/2:Context#Page 25 of 139|Dover trial ruling: Context]] [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]</ref>

== Who does the ID movement think the designer is? ==

[[William Dembski]] states in his book ''[[Design Inference]]'' that the nature of the intelligent designer cannot be inferred from intelligent design. All leading intelligent design proponents have stated identifying or characterizing the designer is beyond the scope of intelligent design as a line of inquiry. Proponents had hoped that, by avoiding invoking [[creation (theology)|creation]] by a specific supernatural entity, (such as that employed by [[creation science]]), intelligent design would be considered scientific and not violate the [[establishment clause]] of the [[US constitution]]. Proponents feared that were intelligent design identified as a restatement of previous forms of creationism, it would be precluded from being taught in public schools after the [[1987]] [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decision in ''[[Edwards vs Aguillard]]''. This line of reasoning was not particularly persuasive to many in the scientific community, which largely rejected intelligent design as both a line of scientific inquiry and as a basis for a sound education in science.

On December 20, 2005 [[United States federal courts|federal district court]] ruled  in [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] that intelligent design was not science and was essentially religious in nature. The ruling not only rendered that public school district's requirement endorsing intelligent design as an alternative to evolution in science classes unconstitutional
on the grounds that its inclusion violates the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], but validated the objections of critics who discounted proponent's claim that the identity was not God.

Highlighting these mutually exclusive claims about the designer, Dembski, despite having said that the intelligent designer or designers could be any [[deity|god]] or gods, or even [[space alien]]s, has also said that "intelligent design should be understood as the evidence that God has placed in nature to show that the physical world is the product of intelligence and not simply the result of mindless material forces"<ref>[http://www.designinference.com/documents/2005.08.Commending_President_Bush.pdf Why President Bush Got It Right about Intelligent Design] [[William A.

[[William A. Dembski]]. Touchstone Journal, Volume 12, Issue 4, July/August 1999</ref>  

[[Michael Behe]], in his book [[Darwin's Black Box]], suggested the designer might be a [[time travel]]ing cell biologist, apparently ignoring that such a hypothesis results in a [[grandfather paradox]].

At various times each of the leading proponents in the intelligent design movement have clearly expressed that they consider the [[Abrahamic God]] [[Elohim]] in his role as a [[creator God]], to be the intelligent designer and denied that intelligent designer is God, depending on which audience they are addressing. On example is William Dembski, who on his blog in response to the question "Is the designer responsible for biological complexity God?" said "not necessarily" and "To ask who or what is the designer of a particular object is to ask for the immediate intelligent agent responsible for its design. The point is that God is able to work through derived or surrogate intelligences, which can be anything from angels to organizing principles embedded in nature."<ref>[http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/603 Who or what is the designer?] William A. Dembski. Uncommon Descent, December 22, 2005.</ref> Yet to the intelligent design movement's conservative Christian constituents Dembski has said "intelligent design should be understood as the evidence that God has placed in nature to show that the physical world is the product of intelligence and not simply the result of mindless material forces. This evidence is available to all apart from the special revelation of God in salvation history as recounted in Scripture. ... Intelligent design makes it impossible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist.

In addition, the intelligent movement seeks as a well-documented agenda the overall goal "to defeat materialism" and the "materialist world view" as represented by evolution, and replace it with "a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions."<ref>[http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&program=CSC-News&id=2445 Evolution or design debate heats up] Paul Handley.

== What does the ID movement think the designer did? ==

Opinion as to the amount of creation the intelligent designer has done varies within the ID movement.  [[Michael Behe]]'s concept of [[irreducible complexity]] has [[natural selection]] accounting for most of [[evolution]] but the intelligent designer contributing the design of some [[protein]]s.  Others in the ID movement however contest concepts such as [[common descent]], particularly of [[human]]s and other [[ape]]s. Though most in the ID movement seem to be [[Old Earth Creationist]]s, a few are [[Young Earth Creationist]]s who believe in [[ex-nihilo]].

The amount of creation that the intelligent designer did has also been criticised by [[Young Earth Creationist]]s as not being specific enough, and particularly contradicting their beliefs of [[Biblical inerrancy]] and a young earth. <ref name="aig_views">AiGâ€™s views on the Intelligent Design Movement - by Carl Wieland, 30 August 2002 [http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs2002/0830_IDM.asp]</ref> <ref name="morris_design_not_enough">'Design is Not Enough' - by Henry H. Morris, ''Back to Genesis'' pamphlet series, No.127a, July 1999, Institute for Creation Research. [http://www.icr.org/article/859/]</ref>

Some intelligent design proponents say the intelligent designer [[fine-tuned universe|fine-tuned the universe's]] [[physical constant]]s in such a way that life is the result of the universe's physical constants being related to one another in a fashion that permits life to exist. The [[fine-tuned universe|fine-tuned universe argument]] is a central premise or presented as a given in many of the published works of prominent intelligent design proponents, such as [[William A. Dembski]] and [[Michael Behe]].

== Criticism ==

Intelligent design has been presented by its proponents as a "big tent" strategy into which several accounts of creation can fit. Were a scientific version of intelligent design approved for inclusion in public school science curricula, then a path would be opened for discussion of alternatives to not only [[natural selection]] but [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] as well, and eventually religious accounts on the [[origin of life]].  The vast majority of scientists reject the concept of intelligent design and an intelligent designer. Instead, the most widely accepted explanation is that physical processes such as natural selection can account for the complexity of life and other phenomena and features of the universe. Attempts to insert theories of intelligent design into public school science curricula fits in with the intelligent design movement's social aims, via the overturning of Western secularism as detailed in the [[Wedge strategy]]. The concept of the intelligent designer has been criticised as a [[God of the gaps#The "God-of-the-gaps argument" in modern usage|God-of-the-gaps]] argument. Introducing the hypothesis of an intelligent designer introduces the unsolved problem of accounting for the origin of such a designer ([[first cause]]).

By raising the question of the need for a designer for objects with irreducible complexity, intelligent design also raises the question, "what designed the designer?"  [[Richard Dawkins]] has argued that "If complex organisms demand an explanation, so does a complex designer. And it's no solution to raise the theologian's plea that God (or the intelligent designer) is simply immune to the normal demands of scientific explanation,"<ref name="dawkins_complexdesigner">"If complex organisms demand an explanation, so does a complex designer. And it's no solution to raise the theologian's plea that God (or the Intelligent Designer) is simply immune to the normal demands of scientific explanation. To do so would be to shoot yourself in the foot." Richard Dawkins and Jerry Coyne. 1 September 2005. The Guardian [http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/feature/story/0,13026,1559743,00.html]</ref> since such an answer would be unscientific.  With religious creationism, the question "what created God?" can be answered with theological arguments, but in intelligent design, the chain of designers can be followed back indefinitely in an [[Turtles all the way down|infinite regression]], leaving the question of the creation of the first designer dangling. As a result, intelligent design does not explain how the complexity happened in the first place; it just moves it.<ref name="dawkins_time_2">Claudia Wallis. Evolution Wars. Time Magazine, [[15 August]] [[2005]] edition, page 32 [http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1090909,00.html]</ref> 

[[Elliott Sober]] says that by intelligent design's own arguments, a designer capable of creating irreducible complexity must also be irreducibly complex: "Any mind in nature that designs and builds an irreducibly complex system is itself irreducibly complex"<ref name="sober">[http://philosophy.wisc.edu/sober/ID%20and%20the%20Supernatural%20final%20F&P%20single.pdf  Intelligent Design Theory and the  Supernatural - The "God or Extra-terrestrials" Reply] Elliott Sober. University of Wisconsin - Madison.</ref> Sober says that this an argument that intelligent design proponents still need to respond to.

If intelligent design proponents invoke an [[uncaused causer]] or [[deity]] to resolve this problem,<ref name="wdd2">"Christianity postulates the religious answer to this question that the designer is God who by definition is eternally existent and has no origin.

Access Research Network. Frequently Asked Questions about Intelligent Design. [http://www.arn.org/idfaq/How%20can%20you%20tell%20if%20something%20is%20designed.htm]</ref> and reduce intelligent design to religious creationism.  Another possible counter-argument might be an [[Turtles all the way down|infinite regression]] of designers. However, admitting infinite numbers of objects also allows any arbitrarily improbable event to occur <ref name="arbitrarily_improbable">"To explain the origin of the DNA/protein machine by invoking a supernatural Designer is to explain precisely nothing, for it leaves unexplained the origin of the Designer. You have to say something like 'God was always there', and if you allow yourself that kind of lazy way out, you might as well just say 'DNA was always there', or "Life was always there',  and be done with it." Richard Dawkins. ''The Blind Watchmaker : Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design'' pg 141</ref>, such as an object with "specific" complexity assembling itself by chance. Again, this contradicts a fundamental assumption of intelligent design that a designer is needed for every specifically complex object, producing a logical contradiction.

Critics contend the claim that positing a designer which explains gaps in our understanding yet does not need to be itself explained as not a contribution to knowledge but as a [[thought-terminating clichÃ©]].<ref name=Rosenhouse> [http://www.csicop.org/intelligentdesignwatch/designer.html Who Designed the Designer?] Jason Rosenhouse.

==The Dover trial==

In 2005, intelligent design proponents arguments regarding the identity of a designer became an issue considered by the court in [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]], the "Dover trial," where plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form of creationism, and that the school board policy requiring the presentation of intelligent design as an alternative to [[evolution]] as an "explanation of the origin of life" thus violated the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. In his ruling, the judge stated
{{Quotation|"However, as Dr. Haught testified, anyone familiar with Western religious thought would immediately make the association that the tactically unnamed designer is God..."  -- [[wikisource:Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District/4:Whether_ID_Is_Science#Page_25_of_139| ''Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, page 25'']]}}

Jones also commented that the appearance of design is [[Subjectivity|subjective]],
{{Quotation|"It is readily apparent to the Court that the only attribute of design that biological systems appear to share with human artifacts is their complex appearance, i.e. if it looks complex or designed, it must have been designed. (23:73 (Behe)). This inference to design based upon the appearance of a "purposeful arrangement of parts" is a completely subjective proposition, determined in the eye of each beholder and his/her viewpoint concerning the complexity of a system."  -- [[wikisource:Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District/4:Whether_ID_Is_Science#Page_81_of_139| ''Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, page 81'']]}}
and thus the analogy upon which the argument from design rests is flawed.
{{Quotation|"For human artifacts, we know the designer's identity, human, and the mechanism of design, as we have experience based upon empirical evidence that humans can make such things, as well as many other attributes including the designer's abilities, needs, and desires. With ID, proponents assert that they refuse to propose hypotheses on the designer's identity, do not propose a mechanism, and the designer, he/she/it/they, has never been seen. In that vein, defense expert Professor Minnich agreed that in the case of human artifacts and objects, we know the identity and capacities of the human designer, but we do not know any of those attributes for the designer of biological life. In addition, Professor Behe agreed that for the design of human artifacts, we know the designer and its attributes and we have a baseline for human design that does not exist for design of biological systems. Professor Behe's only response to these seemingly insurmountable points of disanalogy was that the inference still works in science fiction movies. -- [[wikisource:Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District/4:Whether_ID_Is_Science#Page_81_of_139| ''Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, page 81'']]}}
