'''Association football''', commonly known as '''football''' or '''soccer''', is a [[team sport]] played between two teams of 11 players. It is the most popular sport in the world.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572379/Soccer.html |title=Soccer |publisher=MSN |encyclopedia=Encarta |accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref> Football is a [[ball]] game played on a rectangular grass or [[artificial turf]] field, with a [[goal (sport)|goal]] at each of the short ends. The object of the game is to score by manoeuvring <!-- this is the correct British English spelling please do NOT change it to maneuvering --> the ball into the opposing goal. In general play, the [[goalkeeper (football)|goalkeeper]] is the only player allowed to use their hands or arms to propel the ball; the rest of the team usually use their feet to [[kick]] the ball into position, occasionally using their [[torso]] or [[head]] to intercept a ball in mid air.  The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is tied at the end of the game, either a [[tie (draw)|draw]] is declared or the game goes into extra time and/or a [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]], depending on the format of the competition.

The modern game was codified in [[England]] following the formation of [[The Football Association]], whose 1863 [[Laws of the Game]] created the foundations for the way the sport is played today. Football is governed internationally by the [[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] (International Federation of Association Football), commonly known by the [[acronym]] FIFA. The most prestigious international football competition is the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], held every four years. This event, the most widely viewed in the world, boasts an audience twice that of the [[Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/en/marketing/newmedia/index/0,3509,10,00.html |title=2002 FIFA World Cup TV Coverage |publisher=FIFA official website |accessdate=2007-09-17}}</ref>

== Nature of the game ==  
[[Image:Soccer goalkeeper.jpg|thumb|250px|A goalkeeper dives to stop the ball from entering his goal.]]
Football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the [[Laws of the Game]].  The game is played using a single round ball (the ''[[football (ball)|football]]''). Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw.

The primary rule is that players (other than [[Goalkeeper (football)|goalkeepers]]) may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play (though they do use their hands during a [[throw-in]] restart). Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around, they may use any part of their bodies other than their hands or arms.<ref name="fouls">{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws12_02.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 12) |accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref>

In typical game play, players attempt to create goalscoring opportunities through individual control of the ball, such as by [[dribbling]], passing the ball to a team-mate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the [[Referee (football)|referee]]. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.<ref name="restart">{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws8_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 8) |accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref>

At a professional level, most matches produce only a few goals. For example, the [[FA Premier League 2005-06|2005&ndash;06 season]] of the [[England|English]] [[Premier League]] produced an average of 2.48 goals per match.<ref>{{cite web |title=England Premiership (2005/2006) |work=Sportpress.com |url=http://www.sportpress.com/stats/en/738_england_premiership_2005_2006/11_league_summary.html |accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref> The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper,<ref name=LAW301>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws3_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 3&ndash;Number of Players) |accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> but a number of [[football (soccer) positions|specialised roles]] have evolved.  Broadly, these include three main categories: [[striker]]s, or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; [[Defender (football)|defenders]], who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and [[midfielder]]s, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball in order to pass it to the forwards. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, in order to discern them from the single goalkeeper. These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4196830.stm |title=Positions guide, Who is in a team? |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> The layout of a team's players is known as a [[Formation (football)|''formation'']]. Defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's [[manager (football)|manager]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197420.stm |title=Formations |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref>

== History and development ==

Countries where football is the most popular sport are coloured green, while countries where it is not are coloured red. The various shades of green and red indicate the number of players per 1,000 inhabitants.]]

Games revolving around the kicking of a ball have been played in many countries throughout history.  According to [[FIFA]], the "very earliest form of the game for which there is scientific evidence was an exercise of precisely this skilful technique dating back to the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC in [[China]] (the game of [[Cuju]])."<ref>{{cite web | title = History of Football | work = FIFA| url = http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/game/historygame1.html | accessdate =2006-11-20}}</ref> In addition, the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] game ''[[Harpastum]]'' may be a distant ancestor of football. Various forms of [[medieval football|football were played in medieval Europe]], though rules varied greatly by both period and location. 

<!--Text commented out due to lack of verifiable reference, see talk page--><!--Whilst football has continued to be played in various forms throughout the [[United Kingdom]], the English [[Independent school (UK)|public schools]] (fee-paying schools) are widely credited with certain key achievements in the creation of modern football (association football and the [[rugby football]] games&mdash;[[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]] football). During the sixteenth century English public schools generally, and headmaster [[Richard Mulcaster]] in particular, were instrumental in taking football away from its violent "[[Mob rule|mob]]" form and turning it into an organised team sport that was beneficial to schoolboys. Thereafter, the game became institutionalised, regulated, and part of a larger, more central tradition. Many early descriptions of football and references to it (e.g., in poetry) were recorded by people who had studied at these schools, showing they were familiar with the game. Finally, in the 19th century, teachers and former students were the first to write down formal rules of early modern football to enable matches to be played between schools.-->
The modern rules of football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played at the public schools of England. The [[Cambridge Rules]], first drawn up at [[Cambridge University]] in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of Association football and subsequent codes. The Cambridge Rules were written at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1848, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, [[Harrow School|Harrow]], [[Rugby School|Rugby]], [[Winchester College|Winchester]] and [[Shrewsbury School|Shrewsbury]] schools, but they were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the [[Sheffield F.C.|Sheffield Football Club]], formed by former public school pupils in 1857,<ref>{{cite book |last=Harvey |first=Adrian |title=Football, the first hundred years |publisher=Routledge |pages=pp.126 |date=2005 |location=London |isbn=0415350182}}</ref> which led to formation of a [[Sheffield & Hallamshire Football Association|Sheffield FA]] in 1867. In 1862, [[J. C. Thring|John Charles Thring]] of [[Uppingham School]] also devised an influential set of rules.<ref>{{cite news |first=David |last=Winner |date=2005-03-28 | title = The hands-off approach to a man's game |work=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,27-1544006,00.html |accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref>

These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of [[The Football Association]] (The FA) in 1863, which first met on the morning of [[26 October]] [[1863]] at the Freemason's Tavern in [[Great Queen Street]], [[London]].<ref name="FAhistory">{{cite web |title=History of the FA |work=Football Association website |url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/TheOrganisation/Postings/2004/03/HISTORY_OF_THE_FA.htm |accessdate=2007-10-09}}</ref> The only school to be represented on this occasion was [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]]. The Freemason's Tavern was the setting for five more meetings between October and December, which eventually produced the first comprehensive set of rules. At the final meeting, the first FA treasurer, the representative from [[Blackheath Rugby Club|Blackheath]], withdrew his club from the FA over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting, the first which allowed for the running with the ball in hand and the second, obstructing such a run by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Other [[History of rugby union|English rugby football clubs followed this lead]] and did not join the FA, or subsequently left the FA and instead in 1871 formed the [[Rugby Football Union]]. The eleven remaining clubs, under the charge of [[Ebenezer Cobb Morley]], went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game.<ref name="FAhistory"/> These rules included handling of the ball by "marks" and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to [[Australian rules football|Victorian rules football]] being developed at that time in Australia. The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games.

The laws of the game are currently determined by the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB). The Board was formed in 1886<ref>{{cite web |title=The International FA Board |publisher=FIFA |url=http://access.fifa.com/en/history/history/0,3504,3,00.html |accessdate=2007-09-02 }}</ref> after a meeting in [[Manchester]] of The Football Association, the [[Scottish Football Association]], the [[Football Association of Wales]], and the [[Irish Football Association]]. The world's oldest football competition is the [[FA Cup]], which was founded by [[C. W. Alcock]] and has been contested by English teams since 1872. The first official international football match took place in 1872 between Scotland and England in [[Glasgow]], again at the instigation of C. W. Alcock. England is home to the world's first [[The Football League|football league]], which was founded in 1888 by [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] director [[William McGregor]].<ref>{{cite web | title = The History Of The Football League | work = Football League website | url = http://www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10794,00.html | accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref> The original format contained 12 clubs from the Midlands and the North of England. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the international football body, was formed in [[Paris]] in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to Laws of the Game of the Football Association.<ref>{{cite web | title = History of FIFA | work = FIFA website | url = http://access.fifa.com/en/history/history/0,3504,4,00.html | accessdate = 2007-09-02}}</ref> The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the [[International Football Association Board]] in 1913. The board currently consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations.

Today, football is played at a professional level all over the world. Millions of people regularly go to football stadia to follow their favourite teams,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/news/theknowledge/0,9204,1059366,00.html |title=Baseball or Football: which sport gets the higher attendance? | author = Ingle, Sean and Barry Glendenning | date = [[2003-10-09]] | publisher=Guardian Unlimited |accessdate=2006-06-05}}</ref> while billions more watch the game on television.<ref>{{cite web | title = TV Data | work = FIFA website | url = http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/marketingtv/factsfigures/tvdata.html | accessdate = 2007-09-02 }}</ref> A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level. According to a survey conducted by FIFA published in 2001, over 240 million people from more than 200 countries regularly play football.<ref>{{cite web | title = FIFA Survey: approximately 250 million footballers worldwide | work = FIFA website | url = http://www.access.fifa.com/infoplus/IP-199_01E_big-count.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-09-02 }}</ref> Its simple rules and minimal equipment requirements have no doubt aided its spread and growth in popularity.

In many parts of the world football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual [[Fan (aficionado)|fan]]s, local communities, and even nations; it is therefore often claimed to be the most popular sport in the world. [[ESPN]] has spread the claim that the [[Côte d'Ivoire national football team]] helped secure a truce to the nation's civil war in 2005. By contrast, football is widely considered to be the final proximate cause in the [[Football War]] in June 1969 between [[El Salvador]] and [[Honduras]].<ref>{{cite web | title =

Drezner | date = [[2006-06-04]] | page = B01}}</ref>

== Laws of the game ==
There are seventeen laws in the official [[Laws of the Game]]. The same Laws are designed to apply to all levels of football, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors or women are permitted. The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football. The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the [[International Football Association Board]], not FIFA itself.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/lawsofthegame.html| title=Laws Of The Game |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=2007-09-02}}</ref>

=== Players, equipment and officials ===
{{seealso|Football (soccer) positions|Formation (football)|kit (football)}}

Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding [[substitute (football)|substitute]]s), one of whom must be the [[goalkeeper (football)|goalkeeper]]. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team; this is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the [[Penalty area (football)|penalty area]] in front of their own goal. Though there are a variety of [[Football (soccer) positions|positions]] in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.<ref name=LAW301/>

The basic equipment or ''[[Kit (association football)|kit]]'' players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate [[shin guard]]s. Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches. The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws4_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 4&ndash;Players' Equipment) |accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref>

A number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is three, though the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in friendly matches. Common reasons for a substitution include injury, tiredness, ineffectiveness, a tactical switch, or [[timewasting]] at the end of a finely poised game. In standard adult matches, a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws3_02.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 3&ndash;Substitution procedure) |accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref>

A game is officiated by a [[referee (football)|referee]], who has "full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed" (Law 5), and whose decisions are final. The referee is assisted by two [[assistant referee]]s. In many high-level games there is also a [[fourth official]]  who assists the referee and may replace another official should the need arise.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws5_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 5&ndash;The referee) |accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref>

=== Pitch ===
[[Image:Football pitch metric.svg|510px|thumb|right|Standard pitch measurements ([[:Image:Football pitch imperial.svg|See Imperial version]])]]
{{main|Football pitch}}

As the Laws were formulated in England, and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within [[IFAB]], the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in [[imperial units]]. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate [[SI|metric]] equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though popular use tends to continue to use traditional units in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of [[metrification]], such as Britain.<ref>{{cite web | title = Will we ever go completely metric? | work = BBC| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3934353.stm | date = [[2004-09-02]] | author = Summers, Chris | accessdate =2007-10-07}}</ref>

The length of the pitch for international adult matches is in the range 100&ndash;110 metres (110&ndash;120&nbsp;yd) and the width is in the range 64&ndash;75 metres (70&ndash;80 [[yard|yd]]). Fields for non-international matches may be 100&ndash;130 yards length and 50&ndash;100 yards in width, provided that the pitch does not become square. The longer boundary lines are ''touchlines'' or ''sidelines'', while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are ''goal lines''. A rectangular goal is positioned at the middle of each goal line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 1.1&ndash;The field of play) |accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be {{convert|8|yd|m|1}} apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be {{convert|8|ft|m|2}} above the ground. Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_04.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 1.4&ndash;The Field of play) |accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref>

In front of each goal is an area known as the [[penalty area]] (colloquially "18-yard box" or simply "the box" or "the area"). This area is marked by the goal-line, two lines starting on the goal-line {{convert|18|yd|m|1}} from the goalposts and extending {{convert|18|yd|m|1}} into the pitch perpendicular to the goal-line, and a line joining them. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penal foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a [[penalty kick (football)|penalty kick]]. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick-offs, goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_03.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 1.3&ndash;The field of play) |accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref>

=== Duration and tie-breaking methods ===

A standard adult football match consists of two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute "half-time" break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time.

The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is commonly referred to as ''stoppage time'' or ''injury time'', and is at the sole discretion of the referee.  The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, toward the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws7_02.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 7.2&ndash;The duration of the match) |accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref>

In league competitions games may end in a draw, but in some knockout competitions if a game is tied at the end of regulation time it may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootouts]] (known officially in the Laws of the Game as "kicks from the penalty mark") to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament. Goals scored during extra time periods count toward the final score of the game, but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament (with goals scored in a penalty shootout not making up part of the final score).

Competitions held over two legs (in which each team plays at home once) may use the [[away goals rule]] to determine which team progresses in the event of equal aggregate scores. If the result is still equal, kicks from the penalty mark are usually required, though some competitions may require a tied game to be replayed.

In the late 1990s, the [[IFAB]] experimented with ways of creating a winner without requiring a penalty shootout, which was often seen as an undesirable way to end a match. These involved rules ending a game in extra time early, either when the first goal in extra time was scored (''[[golden goal]]''), or if one team held a lead at the end of the first period of extra time (''[[silver goal]]'').  Golden goal was used at the World Cup in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]. The first World Cup game decided by a golden goal was [[France national football team|France]]'s victory over [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] in 1998. [[Germany national football team|Germany]] was the first nation to score a golden goal in a major competition, beating [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] in the final of [[Euro 1996]]. Silver goal was used in [[Euro 2004]]. Both these experiments have been discontinued by IFAB.<ref>{{cite web | title = Time running out for silver goal | work = Reuters| url = http://www.rediff.com/sports/2004/jul/02silver.htm | author = Collett, Mike | date = [[2004-07-02]] | accessdate =2007-10-07}}</ref>

=== Ball in and out of play ===
{{main|Ball in and out of play}}

Under the Laws, the two basic states of play during a game are ''ball in play'' and ''ball out of play''. From the beginning of each playing period with a [[kick-off (football)|kick-off]] (a set kick from the centre-spot by one team) until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of eight restart methods depending on how it went out of play:

* Kick-off: following a goal by the opposing team, or to begin each period of play.<ref name="restart"/>
* [[Throw-in]]: when the ball has wholly crossed the touchline; awarded to opposing team to that which last touched the ball.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws15_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 15&ndash;The Throw-in) |accessdate=2007-10-14}}</ref>
* [[Goal kick]]: when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by an attacker; awarded to defending team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws16_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 16&ndash;The Goal Kick) |accessdate=2007-10-14}}</ref>
* [[Corner kick]]: when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a defender; awarded to attacking team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws17_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 17&ndash;The Corner Kick) |accessdate=2007-10-14}}</ref>
* [[Indirect free kick]]: awarded to the opposing team following "non-penal" fouls, certain technical infringements, or when play is stopped to caution or send-off an opponent without a specific foul having occurred. A goal may not be scored directly from an indirect free kick.<ref name="freekick">{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws13_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 13&ndash;Free Kicks) |accessdate=2007-10-14}}</ref>
* [[Direct free kick]]: awarded to fouled team following certain listed "penal" fouls.<ref name="freekick"/>
* [[Penalty kick (football)|Penalty kick]]: awarded to the fouled team following a foul usually punishable by a direct free kick but that has occurred within their opponent's penalty area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws14_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 14&ndash;The Penalty Kick) |accessdate=2007-10-14}}</ref>
* [[Dropped-ball]]: occurs when the referee has stopped play for any other reason, such as a serious injury to a player, interference by an external party, or a ball becoming defective. This restart is uncommon in adult games.<ref name="restart"/>

=== Fouls and misconduct ===
{{double image|right|Yellow card.svg|60|Red card.svg|60|Players are cautioned with a yellow card, and sent off with a red card.}}
A [[foul (football)|foul]] occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the Laws of the Game while the ball is in play. The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12. Handling the ball deliberately, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent, are examples of "penal fouls", punishable by a [[direct free kick]] or [[penalty kick (football)|penalty kick]] depending on where the offence occurred. Other fouls are punishable by an [[indirect free kick]].<ref name="fouls"/>
[[Image:Ryan Valentine scores.jpg|thumb|left|A player scores a penalty kick given after an offence is committed inside the penalty box]]
The referee may punish a player or substitute's [[misconduct (football)|misconduct]] by a caution (yellow card) or sending-off (red card). A second yellow card at the same game leads to a red card, and therefore to a sending-off. If a player has been sent-off no substitute can be brought on in their place. Misconduct may occur at any time, and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad. In particular, the offence of "unsporting behaviour" may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences. Non-players, such as managers and support staff, may be dismissed by the referee if they fail to conduct themselves in a responsible manner.

Rather than stopping play, the [[referee]] may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as "playing an advantage". The referee may "call back" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within a short period of time, typically taken to be four to five seconds. Even if an offence is not penalised due to advantage being played, the offender may still be sanctioned for misconduct at the next stoppage of play.

The most complex of the Laws is [[offside (football)|offside]]. The offside law limits the ability of attacking players to remain forward (i.e. closer to the opponent's goal-line) of the ball, the second-to-last defending player (which can include the goalkeeper), and the half-way line.<ref>{{cite web | title = The History of Offside | work = Julian Carosi | url = http://mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/corshamref/sub/offhist.htm | accessdate =2006-06-03}}</ref>

== Governing bodies ==
{{seealso|Football (soccer) around the world}}
The recognised international governing body of football (and associated games, such as [[futsal]] and [[beach soccer]]) is the [[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] (FIFA). The FIFA headquarters are located in [[Zürich]].

Six regional confederations are associated with FIFA; these are:

* Asia: [[Asian Football Confederation]] (AFC)
* Africa: [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF)
* Central/North America & Caribbean: [[CONCACAF|Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football]] (CONCACAF; also known as The Football Confederation)
* Europe: [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] (UEFA)
* Oceania: [[Oceania Football Confederation]] (OFC)
* South America: [[CONMEBOL|Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol]] (South American Football Confederation; CONMEBOL)

National associations oversee football within individual countries. These are affiliated both with FIFA and their respective continental confederations.

== Major international competitions ==
The major international competition in football is the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], organised by FIFA. This competition takes place over a four-year period. More than 190 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals. The finals tournament, which is held every four years, involves 32 national teams competing over a four-week period.<ref>The number of competing teams has varied over the history of the competition. The most recent changed was in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], from 24 to 32.</ref> The [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] took place in [[Germany]]; in 2010 it will be held in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|South Africa]].<ref>{{cite web | title = 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa | work = FIFA World Cup website | url = http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/index.html | accessdate =2007-10-07}}</ref>

There has been a [[Football at the Summer Olympics|football tournament]] at every [[Summer Olympic Games]] since 1900, except at the 1932 games in [[1932 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles]]. Prior to the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) had the same status as the World Cup. Originally, the event was for amateurs only,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://access.fifa.com/en/history/history/0,3504,4,00.html |title=Where it all began |publisher=FIFA official website |accessdate=2007-10-09}}</ref> however, since the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] professional players have been permitted, albeit with certain restrictions which prevent countries from fielding their strongest sides. Currently, the Olympic men's tournament is played at Under-23 level.  In the past the Olympics have allowed a restricted number of over-age players per team;<ref>{{cite web |title=Football - An Olympic Sport since 1900 |work=IOC website |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/index_uk.asp?SportCode=FB |accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref> but that practice will cease in the 2008 Olympics.  The Olympic competition is not generally considered to carry the same international significance and prestige as the World Cup. A women's tournament was added in 1996; in contrast to the men's event, the women's Olympic tournament is played by full international sides without age restrictions. It thus carries international prestige considered comparable to that of the [[FIFA Women's World Cup]].

After the World Cup, the most important football competitions are the continental championships, which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams. These are the [[European Football Championship|European Championship]] (UEFA), the [[Copa América]] (CONMEBOL), [[African Cup of Nations]] (CAF), the [[Asian Cup]] (AFC), the [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]] (CONCACAF) and the [[OFC Nations Cup]] (OFC). The most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective continental championships, which are generally contested between national champions, for example the [[UEFA Champions League]] in [[Europe]] and the [[Copa Libertadores de América]] in [[South America]]. The winners of each continental competition contest the [[FIFA Club World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Organising Committee strengthens FIFA Club World Cup format | work = [[FIFA]]| url = http://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/organisation/media/newsid=570740.html|date=[[2007-08-24]] | accessdate =2007-10-07}}</ref>

== Domestic competitions ==
{{main|Football (soccer) around the world}}

The governing bodies in each country operate [[league system]]s, normally comprising several [[division (sport)|division]]s, in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results. Teams are placed into [[table (information)|table]]s, placing them in order according to points accrued. Most commonly, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a [[round-robin tournament]]. At the end of a season, the top team are declared the champions. The top few teams may be [[promotion and relegation|promoted]] to a higher division, and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] to a lower division. The teams finishing at the top of a country's league may be eligible also to play in international club competitions in the following season. The main exceptions to this system occur in some [[Latin America]]n leagues, which divide football championships into two sections named [[Apertura and Clausura]], awarding a champion for each.

The majority of countries supplement the league system with one or more ''cup'' competitions. These are organised on a [[single elimination tournament|knock-out]] basis, the winner of each match proceeding to the next round; the loser takes no further part in the competition. 

Some countries' top divisions feature highly-paid star players; in smaller countries and lower divisions, players may be part-timers with a second job, or amateurs.  The five top European leagues—the [[Premier League]], the [[Fußball-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]], [[La Liga]], [[Ligue 1]] and [[Serie A]]—attract most of the world's best players.

The rules of football were codified in England by the Football Association in 1863, and the name ''association football'' was coined to distinguish the game from the [[Football|other forms of football]] played at the time, specifically [[rugby football]]. The term ''soccer'' originated in England, first appearing in the 1880s as a slang abbreviation of Association football, often credited to former England captain, [[Charles Wreford-Brown]].<ref>{{cite web | author = Blain, Rebecca | title = The World's Most Beloved Sport - The History of Soccer | work = fussballportal.de | url = http://germany2006.fussballportal.de/history.php | accessdate =2007-10-07}}</ref>

Today the sport is known by a number of names throughout the English-speaking world, the most common being ''football'' and ''soccer''. Although FIFA, the sport's world governing body, defines the sport they govern as Association football in their statutes,<ref>{{cite web | title = FIFA Statutes | work = FIFA | url = http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/federation/fifa_statutes_0719_en_14479.pdf | format=PDF |accessdate =2007-10-07}}</ref> the term most commonly used by FIFA and the [[International Olympic Committee]] is football.
