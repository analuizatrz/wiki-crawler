'''Edward Matthew Ward''' ([[July 14]], [[1816]] &ndash; [[January 15]], [[1879]]) was an [[England|English]] [[Victorian era|Victorian]] narrative painter best known for his murals in the [[Palace of Westminster]] depicting episodes in British history from the [[English Civil War]] to the [[Glorious Revolution]].

Ward was born in [[Pimlico]], [[England]]. As a student at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] Ward became a member of [[The Clique]], a group of painters led by [[Richard Dadd]]. Like other members of the Clique Ward saw himself as a follower of [[Hogarth]] and [[David Wilkie (artist)|Wilkie]], considering their styles to be distinctly national in character. Many of his early paintings were set in the [[eighteenth century]] and were on Hogarthian subjects. He also painted episodes from [[seventeenth century]] history, influenced by the thinking of his friend, the historian [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]]. He also painted subjects from the history of the [[French Revolution]].

In the 1850s Ward came into conflict with the [[Pre-Raphaelites]], especially [[Millais]], whose style of art he considered to be un-British. Ward's painting of [[Charlotte Corday]] being led to execution beat Millais's [[Ophelia (painting)|Ophelia]] for a prize at Liverpool, leading to much debate at the time.

Such historical paintings led to Ward's commission to paint eight scenes in the corridor leading into the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. These were to depict parallel episodes on the [[Cavaliers (royalists)|Royalist]] and [[Parliamentary]] sides in the Civil War. Ward's paintings depict the opposed figures as if confronting one another across the corridor.

Ward continued to paint Hogarthian versions of episodes from British history throughout the 1860s, notably ''Hogarth's Studio in 1739'' (1863, [[York City Art Gallery]]) the ''Antechamber at Whitehall During the Dying Moments of Charles II'' (1865, [[Walker Art Gallery]], Liverpool). In the 1870s he painted some modern-life genre subjects, but towards the end of the decade began to suffer painful illness and depression, resulting in his suicide in 1879.

His wife [[Henrietta Ward]] was also a painter. After her husband's death she became a successful art teacher. His son [[Leslie Ward]] became a popular [[caricature|caricaturist]] for the magazine [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] under the nickname 'Spy'.
