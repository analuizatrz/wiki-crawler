Tenacious D's music showcases Black's theatrical vocals and Gass' acoustic guitar playing abilities. Many of their songs discuss the duo's purported musical and sexual prowess, as well as their friendship and intake  of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. Their albums feature absurd and humorous sketches. Music critics have compared the storyteller-style lyrics of their songs to lyrics of [[rock opera]].<ref name='The Seattle Times'>{{cite news | first=Ted | last=Fry | coauthors= | title=Sympathy for the devil: Rockers seek Satan's pick | date=[[2006-11-22]] | publisher= | url =http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/movies/2003441928_tenacious22.html | work =The Seattle Times | pages = | accessdate = 2007-03-15 | language = }}</ref><ref name='Entertainment Weekly'>{{cite news | first=Owen | last=Gleiberman | coauthors= | title=Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny (2006) | date=[[2006-11-21]] | publisher= | url =http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1562105,00.html | work =Entertainment Weekly | pages = | accessdate = 2007-03-15 | language = }}</ref> 

The band first gained popularity in 1999 when they starred in the self-titled ''[[Tenacious D (TV series)|Tenacious D]]'', a [[television series]] on [[HBO]], in which Black and Gass attempted to establish themselves as the "Greatest Band on Earth".<ref name="AMG" /> The series airs occasionally on [[Comedy Central]] and is available on their DVD, ''[[The Complete Masterworks]]''. In addition, they have since recorded two albums, and starred in their own movie, ''[[Tenacious D in: The Pick of Destiny]]''.

==History==
===Beginnings===

Black and Gass, at the time respectively aged 16 and 24, met in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] during the [[Edinburgh Fringe]]. Both at the time were members of the [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]-based theatre troupe, [[The Actors' Gang]].<ref name="tenacious-d-Scotsman">{{cite news | author=Rory Ford | title=Best band in the world? | work=Edinburgh Evening News | date=2003-03-13 | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref><ref name="tenacious-d-edinburgh">{{cite news | author=Chay Woodman | title=Tenacious D Interview | work=Virtual Festivals | url=http://www.virtualfestivals.com/artists/article.cfm?artistid=-1&articleid=411&startrow=2 | date=2006-02-7 | accessdate=2006-12-19}}</ref> While Gass initially felt threatened by Black, they eventually worked out their differences, and formed a band.<ref name="Sunday-times">{{cite news | author=The Sunday Times | title=Dude, where’s my guitar? | work=The Sunday Times | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2101-2421194,00.html | date=[[2006-08-29]] | accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref>

The band's name was derived from a term used by sports commentator [[Marv Albert]] about the tenacious [[defense (sport)|defense]] of the [[NBA]]'s [[New York Knicks]].<ref name="tenacious-d-edinburgh">{{cite news | author=Chay Woodman | title=Tenacious D Interview | work=Virtual Festivals | url=http://www.virtualfestivals.com/artists/article.cfm?artistid=-1&articleid=411&startrow=2 | date=2006-02-7 | accessdate=2006-12-19}}</ref> The name was decided by the audience of the band's first live show, in 1994 at the now defunct Al's Bar.

===Friendship===

In an interview on [[BBC Radio 1]] aired on [[January 18]], [[2006]], with [[Colin Murray]], Gass described Black as one of his best friends, adding that he is the [[Godparent|godfather]] of Black’s son: Samuel Jason.<ref name=Sunday-herald>{{cite news | author=Neala Johnston | title=Tenacious and talented | work=Herald Sun | url=http://www.news.com.au/sundayheraldsun/story/0,,21038458-5006024,00.html | date=[[2007-01-11]] | accessdate=2007-01-20}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[High Times]]'', Gass described his relationship with Black as being "pretty organic", and described Black as being "meaner" on stage.<ref name=high-times>{{cite news | author=Chris Parker | title=Are Jack Black and Kyle Gass the new Cheech & Chong? | work=High Times | url=http://www.hightimes.com/ht/entertainment/content.php?bid=65&aid=3 | date=[[2002-07-31]] | accessdate=2007-01-11}}</ref> In the same interview, Black posits that "pain and exile" were what brought the duo together.<ref name=high-times>{{cite news | author=Chris Parker | title=Are Jack Black and Kyle Gass the new Cheech & Chong? | work=High Times | url=http://www.hightimes.com/ht/entertainment/content.php?bid=65&aid=3 | date=[[2002-07-31]] | accessdate=2007-01-11}}</ref> When Gass was asked whether he felt jealously towards Black's film career in relation to his own, he responded: "If you're really friends with someone, you want them to be as successful as possible.

===Television series (1997 – 2000)===
{{main|Tenacious D (TV series)}}
''Tenacious D'' premiered in 1997, immediately following an episode of ''Mr. Show''. While a total of six episodes, ten- to twelve-minutes in length, were produced, only the first two were aired that year; the final four episodes did not air until the summer of 2000.<ref name="ign-tenacious-d">{{cite news | author=Brian Zoromski | title=Tenacious D: The Series | work=IGN.com | url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/746/746937p1.html | date=2006-11-20 | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> Although the show heavily featured Tenacious D songs, the tone and content of the series was very much shaped by collaborators [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[David Cross]], and director [[Tom Gianas]]. The show dealt with the trials and tribulations of a band trying to make it in the music business. Many songs that eventually were included on the band's first album were first featured on the show, though the episodes also contain songs that remain unreleased. 

The six episodes were titled "The Search for Inspirado", "Angel in Disguise", "Death of a Dream", "The Greatest Song in the World", "The Fan", and "Road Gig". <!--I think more happened in this period than just a TV series--> After the series aired, the band continued to perform.

<!-- Google seems to say that Tribute was first. Please don't change this unless you can cite something to say otherwise -->
The first single from the album was "[[Tribute (song)|Tribute]]" &mdash; a tribute to the "greatest and best song in the world" which, in the song, Tenacious D claimed they had performed in order to save their souls from a [[Demon]]. The music video for this song was directed by [[Liam Lynch (musician)|Liam Lynch]], and features [[Dave Grohl]] as the demon, along with cameos by [[Jason Reed]], [[Ben Stiller]] and Lynch himself. This was followed by the second single, "[[Wonderboy]]", the [[music video]] of which was directed by [[Spike Jonze]].

Two follow-up singles were released from the album. "Dio" was written as a tribute to the rock singer [[Ronnie James Dio]], and mocked him somewhat for being too old, and asked for him to stop playing rock music and "pass the torch" to Tenacious D. Dio liked the song enough to let the band appear in the music video for his song, "Push". The music video for "[[Fuck Her Gently]]" was animated by [[Spümcø]] leader [[John Kricfalusi]], the creator of ''[[Ren and Stimpy]]''. An [[extended play|EP]] entitled ''[[D Fun Pak]]'' was released in 2002. It featured a skit and acoustic versions of "[[Jesus Ranch]]" and "Kyle Quit The Band", as well as a [[megamix]] by [[Mocean Worker]].

===''The Pick of Destiny'' (2004 &ndash; Present)===

In July 2004, the band started production on their film, ''Tenacious D in: The Pick of Destiny''. Filming was delayed by almost a year due to Black being cast in [[Peter Jackson]]'s big budget remake of ''[[King Kong (2005)|King Kong]]'', which was shot in [[New Zealand]]. While on location, Black continued to work on preproduction for the Tenacious D film and shooting for ''The Pick of Destiny'' started in July 2005 with director [[Liam Lynch (musician)|Liam Lynch]],<ref name='Cinema Blend'>{{cite news | first=Joshua | last=Tyler | coauthors= | title=Picking Destiny With The D | date=[[2005-07-21]] | publisher= | url =http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Picking-Destiny-With-The-D-1372.html | work =Cinema Blend | pages = | accessdate = 2007-04-01 | language = }}</ref> who had previously directed the band's "Tribute" music video.

To coincide with the release of their new movie and album, Tenacious D embarked on their [[Tenacious D's 2006-07 Tour|2006&ndash;07 tour]] of the U.S., Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand.  This tour, which stopped mainly in small theaters, included the band's first headlining date at a major arena, [[New York City]]'s [[Madison Square Garden]].

In an interview from November 2006, Gass hinted a desire for Tenacious D to end at their current highpoint,  though it is possible that he could have been joking; in the same interview, Jack Black expressed wishes to take a year-long break from acting.<ref name="associated-press-interview">{{cite news | author=The Associated Press | title=Tenacious D: Portly powerhouse of rock | work=http://www.kltv.com/ | url=http://www.kltv.com/global/story.asp?s=5722208 | date=[[2006-11-23]] | accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref> A third studio album has neither been announced nor ruled out.

In 2006, Tenacious D starred in their own movie, ''Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny'', in which they set out to become the greatest rock band in the world, by means of a [[guitar pick]] with magical powers.

Black and Gass have made several television appearances performing songs from their first album. In [[June 16]], [[2001]], Tenacious D were featured as puppets performing "Friendship" on an episode of ''[[Crank Yankers]]''. In [[April 27]], [[2002]] they guest starred on ''[[MADtv]]'' playing the song "Tribute" with [[Foo Fighters]] vocalist [[Dave Grohl]] on drums. Later, Tenacious D made an appearance in the first episode of ''[[Tom Goes to the Mayor]]'' to be televised on [[Adult Swim]].  In the episode, they were known as "The Bear Trap Brothers," two competitive brothers who ran bear trap shops that were located side-by-side. The band appeared in musical promotional clips on MTV during the week before the premiere of ''[[The Osbournes]]''. The two musical shorts featured Black and Gass dressed in stereotypical rock outfits. These appearances were featured on ''[[Tenacious D - The Complete Masterworks|The Complete Masterworks]]'' as an [[Easter egg (virtual)|easter egg]].

In the run up to the release of ''The Pick of Destiny'' film, Tenacious D made several appearances performing the "[[POD (song)|Pick of Destiny]]" song, including at the [[American Music Awards of 2006|2006 American Music Awards]] on [[11 November]], [[2006]] and on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''. On [[2 December]], [[2006]], Tenacious D was the musical guest on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' for the first time.<ref name='SNL Transcripts'>{{cite web |title=SNL Transcripts: Matthew Fox |date=2006-12-02 |work=snltranscripts.jt.org |url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/06/06g.phtml |pages=Season 32: Episode 7 |accessdate=2007-08-18}}</ref> They opened the 2006 [[Spike TV]] Video Game Awards, with a performance of "The Metal".<ref name="gamespot-tenacious-d">{{cite news | author=Tim Surette | title=Oblivion nabs Spike TV top honors | work=Gamespot UK | url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6162929.html?sid=6162929 | date=2007-12-09 | accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref>

The song "The Metal" from [[The Pick of Destiny]] is featured in the video game [[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]], in the sixth set titled "The Hottest Band On Earth," likely a reference to Tenacious D's running joke of being the greatest band in the world.

=== Tours ===
[[Image:Saxaboom.jpg|thumb|Tenacious D 'playing' the [[Sax-a-boom]] live.]]
Tenacious D started their second nationwide [[Concert|concert tour]] in 2001, playing at bigger venues, many of which sold out.<ref name="AMG" /> Until 2006, Tenacious D usually performed only with acoustic guitars and rarely performed with a full band. Tenacious D has staged two international concert tours, and numerous domestic tours,<ref name="tenacious-d-tours">{{cite web|url=http://tenaciousd.com/tour.html|title=Tenacious D's tours|accessdate=January 13|accessyear=2007}}</ref> though they have rarely played in non-English speaking countries. Black says this is because foreign concerts are "a little funky" because "the subtleties do get lost in translation".<ref name="Relix" /> In addition, he comments of the angst they experience before concerts saying: "We're always looking for a loophole. Pretty much every concert we've ever done, we're trying to find a way to cancel the show at the last minute."<ref name="Relix" />

===Guest appearances===
