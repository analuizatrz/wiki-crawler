'''Everett McGill''' (b. '''Charles Everett McGill''' on [[October 21]], [[1945]]) is an [[US|American]] actor, born in [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]], [[Florida]]. He graduated from Rosedale Highschool, Rosedale, Kansas, in 1963.

McGill has a relatively short filmography, but has managed to garner some level of fame by appearing in films and television series, including a stint as Chad Richards on the [[soap opera]] ''[[The Guiding Light]]'' in [[1975]] and [[1976]], with [[cult following]]s. After coming into the public eye in 1981 for his role as the rugged [[caveman]] leader Naoh in ''[[Quest for Fire]]'', McGill appeared in ''[[Silver Bullet (film)|Silver Bullet]]'', a 1985 [[werewolf]] movie inspired by a [[Stephen King]] short story; the [[Korean War]] battle epic ''[[Field of Honor]]'' and the [[Clint Eastwood]] war film ''[[Heartbreak Ridge]]'' in 1986; and in the 1989 installment of the [[James Bond]] franchise, ''[[Licence to Kill]]''. 

The muscular, 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) tall actor is probably most widely recognized for his work with director [[David Lynch]]. McGill first worked with Lynch in the 1984 adaptation of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'', in which he played Fremen leader [[Stilgar]]. McGill later appeared as a major character on the TV series ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', in which he played [[Ed Hurley]], a sensitive mechanic torn between his high school sweetheart, [[Norma Jennings]], and his shrewish, one-eyed wife, [[Nadine Hurley|Nadine]]. Ed and Norma's troubled romance was one of the show's major storylines. Subsequently, McGill also appeared in Lynch's 1999 film, ''[[The Straight Story]]'', again as a mechanic.

In 1991, McGill and his ''Twin Peaks'' spouse [[Wendy Robie]] appeared as the husband-and-wife villains of the [[Wes Craven]] feature, ''[[The People Under the Stairs]]''. He appeared in ''[[My Fellow Americans]]'' as "twisted psycho" Colonel Paul Tanner, and in ''[[Under Siege 2]]'' as an equally twisted and ruthless [[mercenary]].

==Trivia==
''[[Babylon 5]]'' producer [[J. Michael Straczynski]] originally intended for Everett McGill to play the role of Major Ryan in the episode "[[Severed Dreams]]".  However he did not know McGill's first name, so when he asked to have McGill contacted, Straczynski was asked if he meant [[Bruce McGill]], to which he replied, "yes".  Even though it became apparent to Straczynski when Bruce McGill met him for lunch that this was not the McGill he expected, Straczynski decided to use Bruce McGill anyway.

McGill's nickname at Rosedale Highschool was "Punkie."
