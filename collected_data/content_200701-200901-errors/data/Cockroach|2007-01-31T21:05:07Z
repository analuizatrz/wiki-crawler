'''Cockroaches''' are [[insect]]s of the Order '''Blattodea'''. The name of the order is derived from Greek for "cockroach," ''blatta''. There are roughly 3,500 species in six families. Cockroaches exist worldwide, with the exception of the polar regions. Cockroaches are also simply known as "roaches".

The English word ''cockroach'' is derived from the Spanish ''cucaracha''. 

Among the most well-known species are the [[American cockroach]], ''Periplaneta americana'', which is about 3&nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]] long, the [[German cockroach]], ''Blattella germanica'', about 1½&nbsp;cm long, and the [[Asian cockroach]], ''Blattella asahinai'', also about 1½ cm in length.  [[Tropics|Tropical]] cockroaches are often much bigger, and extinct cockroach relatives such as the [[Carboniferous]] ''[[Archimylacris]]'' and the [[Permian]] ''[[Apthoroblattina]]'' were several times as large as these. When infesting buildings, cockroaches are considered [[pest (animal)|pest]]s; out of the thousands of species, however, only a handful fall into this designation. 

==Evolutionary history and relationships==
The earliest cockroach-like fossils are from the [[Carboniferous]] period between 354&ndash;295 million years ago. However, these fossils differ from modern cockroaches in having long [[ovipositor]]s and are apparently the ancestors of [[mantid]]s as well as modern cockroaches. Current evidence strongly suggests that [[termite]]s have evolved, in turn, directly from true cockroaches. The first fossils of "modern" cockroaches with short ovipositors appear in the early [[Cretaceous]]. [[Mantodea]], [[Isoptera]], and Blattodea are usually combined by [[entomologists]] into a higher group called [[Dictyoptera]].

==Biology==
Cockroaches are generally either [[scavenger]]s or [[omnivorous|omnivores]]. The exception to this is the [[wood]]-eating ''[[Cryptocercus]]'' species found in China and the United States. Although they are incapable of digesting the [[cellulose]] themselves, they have a symbiotic relationship with a [[protozoa]]n that digests the cellulose, allowing them to extract the nutrients. In this, they are similar to termites and current research suggests that the genus ''Cryptocercus'' is more closely related to [[termite]]s than it is to other cockroaches. Cockroaches are most common in tropical and [[subtropical]] climates. Some species are in close association with human dwellings and widely found around garbage or in the kitchen.

[[Image:Blatella germanica cdc.jpg|thumb|Female ''[[Blatella germanica]]'' with ootheca]]
Female cockroaches are sometimes seen carrying egg cases on the end of their abdomen; the egg case of the German cockroach holds about 30&ndash;40 long, thin eggs, packed like frankfurters in the case called an [[ootheca]]. The eggs hatch from the combined pressure of the hatchlings gulping air and are initially bright white [[nymph (biology)|nymphs]] that continue inflating themselves with air and harden and darken within about four hours. Their transient white stage while hatching and later while [[ecdysis|molting]] has led to many individuals claiming to have seen albino cockroaches. 

[[Image:Snodgrass common household roaches.png|thumb|'''Common household roaches'''<br /> A. [[German cockroach]], B. [[American cockroach]], C. [[Australian cockroach]], D&E. [[Oriental cockroach]] (♀ & ♂)]]
A female German cockroach carries an egg capsule containing around 40 eggs. She drops the capsule prior to hatching. Development from eggs to adults takes 3-4 months. Cockroaches live up to a year. The female may produce up to eight egg cases in a lifetime; in favorable conditions, it can produce 300-400 offspring. Other species of cockroach, however, can produce an extremely high number of eggs in a lifetime. Laying up to 100 eggs in each egg sac, it only needs to be impregnated once to be able to lay eggs for the rest of its life, allowing one single cockroach to lay over a million eggs during its lifespan.

The world's largest cockroach is the Australian [[giant burrowing cockroach]], which can grow to 9&nbsp;cm in length and weigh more than 30&nbsp;[[gram]]s. Comparable in size is the giant cockroach ''[[Blaberus giganteus]]'', which grows to a similar length but is not as heavy.

Cockroaches are mainly nocturnal and will run away when exposed to light. A peculiar exception is the [[Oriental cockroach]], which is attracted to light, thus making it a far more annoying pest. 

The cockroach is also one of the hardiest insects on the planet, capable of living for a month without food. It can also hold its breath for 45 minutes and has the ability to slow down its heart rate.

It is popularly suggested that cockroaches will "inherit the earth" if humanity destroys itself in a nuclear war. Cockroaches do indeed have a much higher radiation resistance than vertebrates, with the lethal dose perhaps 6 to 15 times that for humans. However, they are not exceptionally radiation-resistant compared to other insects, such as the fruit fly&nbsp;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/moments/s1567313.htm|title=Cockroaches & Radiation |accessmonthday=10 June |accessyear=2006}}</ref>.

The cockroach's ability to withstand radiation better than human beings can be explained in terms of the cell cycle. Cells are more vulnerable to effects of radiation when they are dividing. A cockroach's cells only divide once when in its molting cycle, which at most happens weekly. The cells of the cockroach take roughly 48 hours to complete a molting cycle, which would give time enough for radiation to affect it but not all cockroaches would be molting at the same time. This would mean some would be unaffected by the radiation and thus survive.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/kunkel/cockroach_faq.html#Q5 |title=Are cockroaches resistant to radation? |author =Joseph G. Kunkel |accessmonthday=10 June |accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Behavior==
Cockroaches have been shown to make group decisions&nbsp;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060327/cockroach_ani.html |title=Cockroaches Make Group Decisions |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |author=Jennifer Viegas |accessmonthday=10 June |accessyear=2006}}</ref>.

New research being conducted at the [[University of Florida]] shows that cockroaches leave chemical trails in their feces. Other cockroaches will follow these trails to discover sources of food, water, and where other cockroaches are hiding. One of the major implications of this research is a new technique in cockroach pest control. Cockroaches could be potentially removed from a home by leaving a chemical trail that leads away from the home.

Research has shown that group-based decision making is responsible for more complex behavior such as resource allocation.  A study where 50 cockroaches were placed in a dish with three shelters with a capacity for 40 insects in each, the insects arranged themselves in two shelters with 25 insects in each, leaving the third shelter empty.  When the capacity of the shelters was increased to more than 50 insects per shelter, all of the cockroaches arranged themselves in one shelter.  Researchers found a balance between cooperation and competition exists in group decision-making behavior found in cockroaches.  The models used in this research can also explain the group dynamics of other insects and animals.

== Cockroaches and health risks ==
A 2005 US national study on factors that affect asthma in inner-city children shows that cockroach allergens appear to worsen asthma symptoms more than other known triggers.  This study, funded by the [[United States|US]] [[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]] (NIEHS) and the US [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] (NIAID), is the first large-scale study to rank asthma triggers according to severity.

Additionally, a 2005 research study, sponsored by the National Pest Management Association (NPMA), shows a disparity in homeowner knowledge about this link.  Only 10% of homeowners nationwide feel that cockroaches are a threat to their family’s health.

==Habitat==
Cockroaches live in a wide range of environments around the world.  Pest species of cockroaches adapt readily to a variety of environments, but prefer warm conditions such as found within buildings.  Many tropical species prefer even warmer environments and do not fare well in the average household.  Only a small handful of the 3,500 or so species of cockroach are suited to thrive in the typical home.  

== Interesting facts ==
Few cockroaches die on their backs in the wild.  Natural death of cockroaches probably occurs in the stomach of a bird, bat or other small animal. The reason why cockroaches sometimes die in this position is because cockroaches' legs are not adapted for traversing smooth surfaces such as polished marble or [[vinyl]] floors. Cockroaches have evolved in rugged natural terrain filled with leaves, sticks and other environmental debris. Thus, when a cockroach finds itself on its back it may have trouble righting itself if there is not debris around to grab hold of with its legs. It is also common to come across dead cockroaches that have died of [[insecticide]]. Most of these insecticides are [[pyrethroid]] nerve poisons <ref>Hadlington & Gerozisis, 1995, Urban Pest Control in Australia, University of New South Wales Press Ltd.</ref>. The nerve poison induces muscular spasms which often result in the cockroach flipping on its back.  Without muscular coordination, the cockroach cannot right itself and eventually dies in its upside-down position.

Cockroaches are notoriously hardy animals. Radiologists have found that the lethal radiation dose for a human is approximately 800 [[Röntgen equivalent man|rem]]s (where the typical lifetime exposure is about 16 rems). However, the lethal dose for an American cockroach is 67,500 rems and for the German cockroach it is between 90,000 and 105,000 rems.<ref>Donald Lewis, Department of Entomology. Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa</ref> 
For this reason, and their ability to bury themselves underground, cockroaches could be one of the few species to survive a nuclear blast. However, they would not necessarily inherit the blasted remains of cities: cockroaches need more heat than is naturally available in the wintertime of [[temperate]] areas.

Cockroaches can survive on very little food; it has been discovered that cockroaches will eat the glue from the back of stamps.

It has also been attested that cockroaches can survive for at least seven days, sometimes a month without a head.  This is due to four reasons; one being that a cockroach breaths through [[spiracles]] instead of an airway in its head like every insect, two that cockroaches do not control breathing with their brain, three that a cockroach does not need food often, and four a cockroach does not need blood in the same way humans do.  What is more, experiments have shown that headless cockroaches can be conditioned to avoid electric shocks more quickly than cockroaches that have their heads.[http://rudimentsofwisdom.com/pages/cockroaches.htm]

A person who is allergic to consuming [[shellfish]] is also likely to have an allergy to eating cockroaches. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/spotlighthealth/2004-01-16-fear-factor_x.htm|title=Fear Factor not Afraid of Doctor |accessmonthday=24 October |accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Pest control==
[[Image:Roach control.jpg|thumb|right|165px|Cockroach control, with cockroach baits, boric acid, and hydramethylnon gel.]]
There are numerous parasites and predators of cockroaches, but few of them have proven to be highly effective for biological control. [[Wasps]] in the family Evaniidae are perhaps the most effective insect predators, as they attack the egg cases, and wasps in the family Ampulicidae are predators on adult and nymphal cockroaches (e.g., ''Ampulex compressa''). The [[house centipede]], however, is probably the most effective control agent of cockroaches, though most homeowners find the centipedes themselves objectionable.
Preventative measures include keeping all food stored away in sealed containers, using garbage cans with a tight lid, frequent cleaning in the kitchen, and regular vacuuming. Any water leaks, such as dripping taps, should also be repaired. It is also helpful to seal off any entry points, such as holes around baseboards, pipes, doors, and windows with some steel wool and some cement or putty. Once a cockroach infestation occurs, chemical controls may help alleviate the problem. Bait stations, gels containing [[hydramethylnon]], as well as [[boric acid]] powder, are toxic to cockroaches. Baits with egg killers are also quite effective at reducing the cockroach population. A simple homemade [[Vegas roach trap|Vegas cockroach trap]] is reported to be successful. Additionally, pest control products containing [[deltamethrin]] are very effective.

==Popular culture==
In popular culture, cockroaches are often regarded as vile and extremely resilient pests, due to their shiny [[exoskeleton]]s (making them look slimy, contrary to their fastidious habits), and their size, unusual for a scavenging insect. 

Movies which feature cockroaches include: 
*''[[Joe's Apartment]]'' &mdash; The bugs are cheerful, swinging party-goers who help the titular human hero.
*''[[Creepshow]]'' &mdash; Swarms of them terrorize a cantankerous and verminophobic old man.
*''[[Damnation Alley (film)|Damnation Alley]]'' &mdash; A post-apocalyptic Las Vegas is infected with a flesh-eating mutant variety.
*''[[Men in Black (film)|Men in Black]]'' &mdash; A giant cockroach-like alien's actions threaten to lead to the destruction of the Earth.
*''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]] '' &mdash; Diseased cockroaches are the target of the genetically-altered titular species.
*''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' &mdash; Cockroaches are among the many items served in a banquet scene.
*''[[Team America: World Police]]'' &mdash; After his apparent death, a coachroach crawls out of [[Kim Jong-il]]'s mouth and flies away in a rocket ship, in [[parody]] of ''Men in Black''.

In [[Franz Kafka]]'s [[Existentialism|existentialist]] story [[The Metamorphosis]], the character Gregor Samsa awakes to find himself transformed into a giant insect, often mislabeled as a cockroach. Actually, the type of bug in which Gregor transforms is not specified, though in referring to it as "[[vermin]]", and given what little physical description is offered, the implication is that it is a cockroach (as it is not described in such a way as to possibly be a [[louse]], [[bedbug]], or [[flea]]).

In the ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' episode "[[List of The X-Files episodes#Season 3: 1995-1996|War of The Coprophages]]", cockroaches are seen to group together to murder people. The character Dr. Berenbaum (based on the University of Illinois entomologist) suggests that it is actually swarms of flying cockroaches that are responsible for most [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] sightings (they generate an electro-static field which can be illuminated dependent on atmospheric conditions). In one of the scenes, a cockroach that escaped can be seen crawling over the camera, making it appear that the viewer's television has become infested. Though the shot was not planned, the producers decided to leave it in the episode.

In the television show ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'', Alf inadvertantly releases a [[Melmac (planet)|Melmacian]] cockroach in the house.  When it is sprayed with [[insecticide]], it grows bigger until it is large enough to eat him.  He discovers that a bottle of perfume will kill the cockroach.

The famous [[Mexico|Mexican]] folk song, [[La Cucaracha]], means "The Cockroach" in Spanish, and refers to cockroaches in some of its lines.

In 1987, Los Angeles rapper [[Russ Parr|Bobby Jimmy]] released the song "Roaches" as a parody of [[Timex Social Club]]'s hit song "Rumors".  Its chorus line was ''Look at all these roaches / Around me everyday / Need somethin' strong / To make 'em go away''.

The cult computer game ''[[Bad Mojo]]'' deals with a person turned into a cockroach, in clear reference to Kafka's Metamorphosis.

[[archy and mehitabel|Archy]] is a cockroach in a series of columns by [[Don Marquis]].

[[Megalon]] is a 50 meter tall cockroach that appears in several Japanese [[Godzilla]] films.

Along with rats, cockroaches are frequently seen infesting various locations in [[sam and max]] comics, and one storyline features a race of gigantic cockroaches living on the moon.

In the [[Discworld]] novel ''The Last Continent'', [[Ponder Stibbons]] is horrified to learn that the cockroach is actually the most highly evolved and advanced creature in the world, and not mankind as he had assumed.

In the early [[2000]]s, a pest control company ran a series of television commercials which initially appeared to be for products such as fabric softener or furniture polish, until a cockroach came scurrying across the screen. The bug was digitally edited so that it would actually appear to be ''on'' the viewer's television screen, rather than as part of the tape. Many viewers mistook it for an actual cockroach and tried to swat it. Some damaged their sets and wanted the company to fix them. The company declined.{{fact}}

Tyler Knox published a noir comedy in 2006 called "Kockroach" (William Morrow) in which a cockroach wakes up one morning as a man and becomes a leading gangster in Times Square during the 1950's.

==History==
Some of the earliest writings with regards to cockroaches encourage their use as medicine. [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] (''[[1st century]]''), [[Kamal al-Din al-Damiri]] and [[Abu Hanifa ad-Dainuri]] (''[[9th century]]'') all offered medicines that either suggest grinding them up with oil or boiling. The list of ailments included earaches, open wounds and "gynecological disorders".

==Miscellaneous==
*The largest by weight is a 50&nbsp;[[gram|g]] ''[[Macropanesthia rhinoceros]]''.
*The smallest species is ''[[Attaphila fungicola]]'', reaching only 4&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]].
