==Overview==
HPAI A(H5N1) is an avian disease. There is no evidence of efficient human-to-human transmission or of [[airborne transmission]] of HPAI A(H5N1) to humans. In almost all cases, those infected with H5N1 had extensive physical contact with infected birds. Still, around 60% of humans known to have been infected with the current Asian strain of HPAI A(H5N1) have died from it, and H5N1 may [[mutation|mutate]] or [[reassortment|reassort]] into a strain capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. In 2003, world-renowned virologist [[Robert Webster]] published an article titled "The world is teetering on the edge of a pandemic that could kill a large fraction of the human population" in ''[[American Scientist]]''. He called for adequate resources to fight what he sees as a major world threat to possibly billions of lives.<ref name=webster>

A 2007 study focused on the EMA subclade has shed further light on the EMA mutations. "The 36 new isolates reported here greatly expand the amount of whole-genome sequence data available from recent avian influenza (H5N1) isolates. Before our project, GenBank contained only 5 other complete genomes from Europe for the 2004–2006 period, and it contained no whole genomes from the Middle East or northern Africa. Our analysis showed several new findings. First, all European, Middle Eastern, and African samples fall into a clade that is distinct from other contemporary Asian clades, all of which share common ancestry with the original 1997 Hong Kong strain. Phylogenetic trees built on each of the 8 segments show a consistent picture of 3 lineages, as illustrated by the HA tree shown in Figure 1. Two of the clades contain exclusively Vietnamese isolates; the smaller of these, with 5 isolates, we label V1; the larger clade, with 9 isolates, is V2. The remaining 22 isolates all fall into a third, clearly distinct clade, labeled EMA, which comprises samples from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Trees for the other 7 segments display a similar topology, with clades V1, V2, and EMA clearly separated in each case. Analyses of all available complete influenza (H5N1) genomes and of 589 HA sequences placed the EMA clade as distinct from the major clades circulating in People's Republic of China, Indonesia, and Southeast Asia."<ref> [http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/13/5/713.htm CDC] article ''Genome Analysis Linking Recent European and African Influenza (H5N1) Viruses'' EID Journal Home > Volume 13, Number 5–May 2007 Volume 13, Number 5–May 2007</ref>

H5N1 isolates are identified like this actual HPAI A(H5N1) example, '''A/chicken/Nakorn-Patom/Thailand/CU-K2/04(H5N1)''':
*'''A''' stands for the species of influenza (A, B or C).
*'''chicken''' is the species the isolate was found in
*'''Nakorn-Patom/Thailand''' is the place this specific virus was isolated
*'''CU-K2''' identifies it from other influenza viruses isolated at the same place
*'''04''' represents the year 2004
*'''H5''' stands for the fifth of several known types of the protein [[hemagglutinin]].
*'''N1''' stands for the first of several known types of the protein [[neuraminidase]].

As with other avian flu viruses, H5N1 has strains called "highly pathogenic" (HP) and "low-pathogenic" (LP). Avian influenza viruses that cause HPAI are highly [[virulence|virulent]], and mortality rates in infected flocks often approach 100%. LPAI viruses have negligible virulence, but these viruses can serve as progenitors to HPAI viruses. The current strain of H5N1 responsible for the deaths of birds across the world is an HPAI strain; all other current strains of H5N1, including a North American strain that causes no disease at all in any species, are LPAI strains. All HPAI strains identified to date have involved H5 and H7 subtypes. The distinction concerns pathogenicity in poultry, not humans. Normally a highly pathogenic avian virus is not highly pathogenic to either humans or non-poultry birds. This current deadly strain of H5N1 is unusual in being deadly to so many species, including some, like domestic cats, never previously susceptible to any [[Orthomyxoviridae|influenza virus]].

===Genetic structure and related subtypes===
[[Image:Neuraminidase Ribbon Diagram.jpg|thumb|175px|left|The ''N'' in H5N1 stands for "[[Neuraminidase]]", as depicted in this ribbon diagram.]]
H5N1 is a subtype of the species ''Influenza A virus'' of the ''[[Influenzavirus A]]'' [[genus]] of the ''[[Orthomyxoviridae]]'' family. Like all other influenza A subtypes, the H5N1 subtype is an [[RNA virus]]. It has a segmented [[genome]] of eight negative sense, single-strands of [[RNA]], abbreviated as PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M and NS.

HA codes for [[hemagglutinin]], an [[antigen]]ic [[glycoprotein]] found on the surface of the influenza viruses and is responsible for binding the virus to the cell that is being infected. NA codes for [[neuraminidase]], an antigenic glycosylated [[enzyme]] found on the surface of the influenza viruses. It facilitates the release of progeny viruses from infected cells.<ref name=Couch>{{

The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) RNA strands specify the structure of proteins that are most medically relevant as targets for antiviral drugs and [[antibody|antibodies]]. HA and NA are also used as the basis for the naming of the different subtypes of influenza A viruses. This is where the ''H'' and ''N'' come from in ''H5N1''.

Influenza A viruses are significant for their potential for disease and death in humans and other animals. Influenza A virus subtypes that have been confirmed in humans, in order of the number of known human pandemic deaths that they have caused, include:

*[[H1N1]], which caused "[[Spanish flu]]" and currently causes seasonal [[human flu]]
*[[H2N2]], which caused "Asian flu"
*[[H3N2]], which caused "Hong Kong flu" and currently causes seasonal human flu
*H5N1, the world's major current [[pandemic]] threat
*[[H7N7]], which has unusual [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] potential and killed one person 
*[[H1N2]], which is currently endemic in humans and pigs and causes seasonal human flu
*[[H9N2]], which has infected three people
*[[H7N2]], which has infected two people
*[[H7N3]], which has infected two people
*[[H10N7]], which has infected two people

===Low pathogenic H5N1===
Low pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 (LPAI H5N1) also called "North American" H5N1 commonly occurs in wild birds. In most cases, it causes minor sickness or no noticeable signs of disease in birds. It is not known to affect humans at all. The only concern about it is that it is possible for it to be transmitted to poultry and in poultry mutate into a highly pathogenic strain.

* 1975 – LPAI H5N1 was detected in a wild mallard duck and a wild blue goose in Wisconsin.

* 1981 and 1985 – LPAI H5N1 was detected in ducks by the University of Minnesota conducting a sampling procedure in which sentinel ducks were monitored in cages placed in the wild for a short period of time.

* 1983 – LPAI H5N1 was detected in ring-billed gulls in Pennsylvania.

* 1986 - LPAI H5N1 was detected in a wild mallard duck in Ohio.

* 2005 - LPAI H5N1 was detected in ducks in Manitoba, Canada.

"In the past, there was no requirement for reporting or tracking LPAI H5 or H7 detections in wild birds so states and universities tested wild bird samples independently of USDA. Because of this, the above list of previous detections might not be all inclusive of past LPAI H5N1 detections. However, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) recently changed its requirement of reporting detections of avian influenza. Effective in 2006, all confirmed LPAI H5 and H7 AI subtypes must be reported to the OIE because of their potential to mutate into highly pathogenic strains. Therefore, USDA now tracks these detections in wild birds, backyard flocks, commercial flocks and live bird markets."<ref>{{cite news

H5N1 is easily transmissible between birds facilitating a potential [[global spread of H5N1]]. While H5N1 undergoes mutation and reassortment, creating variations which can infect species not previously known to carry the virus, not all of these variant forms can infect humans. H5N1 as an avian virus preferentially binds to a type of [[galactose]] receptors that populate the avian respiratory tract from the nose to the lungs and are virtually absent in humans, occurring only in and around the [[alveoli]], structures deep in the lungs where oxygen is passed to the blood. Therefore, the virus is not easily expelled by coughing and sneezing, the usual route of transmission.<ref name=Shinya>

H5N1 is mainly spread by domestic [[poultry]], both through the movements of infected birds and poultry products and through the use of infected poultry manure as fertilizer or feed. Humans with H5N1 have typically caught it from chickens, which were in turn infected by other poultry or waterfowl. Migrating [[waterfowl]] (wild [[duck]]s, [[geese]] and [[swan]]s) carry H5N1, often without becoming sick.<ref name=FAO>

===Virulence===
H5N1 has [[mutation|mutated]] into a variety of [[strain (biology)|strains]] with differing pathogenic profiles, some pathogenic to one species but not others, some pathogenic to multiple species. Each specific known genetic variation is traceable to a virus isolate of a specific case of infection.

Other animals may become infected with the virus through direct contact with these bodily fluids or through contact with surfaces contaminated with them. H5N1 remains infectious after over 30 days at 0 °C ( 32.0 °F) (over one month at freezing temperature) or 6 days at 37 °C ( 98.6 °F) (one week at human body temperature) so at ordinary temperatures it lasts in the environment for weeks. In Arctic temperatures, it doesn't degrade at all.

Because migratory birds are among the carriers of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, it is spreading to all parts of the world. H5N1 is different from all previously known highly pathogenic avian flu viruses in its ability to be spread by animals other than poultry.

In October 2004, researchers discovered that H5N1 is far more dangerous than was previously believed. [[Waterfowl]] were revealed to be directly spreading the highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 to [[chicken]]s, [[crow]]s, [[pigeon]]s, and other birds, and the virus was increasing its ability to infect mammals as well. From this point on, avian flu experts increasingly referred to containment as a strategy that can delay, but not ultimately prevent, a future avian flu pandemic.

"Since 1997, studies of influenza A (H5N1) indicate that these viruses continue to evolve, with changes in antigenicity and internal gene constellations; an expanded host range in avian species and the ability to infect felids; enhanced pathogenicity in experimentally infected mice and ferrets, in which they cause systemic infections; and increased environmental stability."<ref name=biegel>

On August 22, 2007, a 28-year-old [[Indonesia]]n chicken trader was the 2nd person to die of bird flu on the island of [[Bali]], after 4 days of hospitalization, raising the death toll due to the disease in Indonesia to 84. Tests in 2 local laboratories were positive for the H5N1 strain of the disease. 194 people — the majority of them in Indonesia -- have died since 2003, according to the [[World Health Organization]]. <ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/08/22/asia/AS-GEN-Indonesia-Bird-Flu.php ITH, Bird flu kills Balinese woman, raises death toll to 84]</ref>

The H5N1 bird flu virus can also pass through a pregnant woman's placenta to infect the fetus, researchers reported on Thursday 27 Sep 2007.
They also found evidence of what doctors had long suspected -- that the virus not only affects the lungs, but also passes throughout the body into the gastrointestinal tract, the brain, liver, and blood cells.

===High mutation rate===
Influenza viruses have a relatively high mutation rate that is characteristic of [[RNA virus]]es.  The segmentation of its [[genome]] facilitates [[genetic recombination]] by segment [[reassortment]] in hosts infected with two different influenza viruses at the same time.<ref name=WHOinfluenza/><ref name=Kou/> A previously uncontagious strain may then be able to pass between humans, one of several possible paths to a pandemic.

The ability of various influenza strains to show species-selectivity is largely due to variation in the [[hemagglutinin]] genes. Genetic [[mutation]]s in the hemagglutinin gene that cause single [[amino acid]] substitutions can significantly alter the ability of viral hemagglutinin proteins to bind to [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] on the surface of host cells. Such mutations in avian H5N1 viruses can change virus strains from being inefficient at infecting human cells to being as efficient in causing human infections as more common human influenza virus types.<ref name=Gambaryan>

}}</ref> This doesn't mean that one amino acid substitution can cause a pandemic, but it does mean that one amino acid substitution can cause an avian flu virus that is not pathogenic in humans to become pathogenic in humans.

[[H3N2]] ("[[swine flu]]") is endemic in pigs in China, and has been detected in pigs in Vietnam, increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. The dominant strain of annual flu virus in January 2006 was [[H3N2]], which is now resistant to the standard antiviral drugs [[amantadine]] and [[rimantadine]]. The possibility of H5N1 and H3N2 exchanging genes through reassortment is a major concern. If a reassortment in H5N1 occurs, it might remain an H5N1 subtype, or it could shift subtypes, as [[H2N2]] did when it evolved into the Hong Kong Flu strain of [[H3N2]].

Both the [[H2N2]] and [[H3N2]] pandemic strains contained [[avian influenza]] virus RNA segments. "While the pandemic human influenza viruses of 1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2) clearly arose through reassortment between human and avian viruses, the influenza virus causing the 'Spanish flu' in 1918 appears to be entirely derived from an avian source".<ref name=Harder>{{

==Humans and H5N1==
The earliest infections of humans by H5N1 coincided with an [[epizootic]] (an epidemic in nonhumans) of H5N1 influenza in Hong Kong's poultry population. This [[panzootic]] (a disease affecting animals of many species, especially over a wide area) outbreak was stopped by the killing of the entire domestic poultry population within the territory.

{{H5N1 cases}}

===Symptoms in humans===
{{further|[[Pneumonia]]}}

Avian influenza [[hemagglutinin]] bind alpha 2-3 [[sialic acid]] receptors while human influenza [[hemagglutinin]] bind alpha 2-6 sialic acid receptors. Usually other differences also exist. There is as yet no human form of H5N1, so all humans who have caught it so far have caught '''avian''' H5N1.

In general, humans who catch a humanized [[Influenzavirus A|Influenza A virus]] (a [[human flu]] virus of type A) usually have symptoms that include [[fever]], [[cough]], [[sore throat]], [[myalgia|muscle aches]], [[conjunctivitis]] and, in severe cases, breathing problems and [[pneumonia]] that may be fatal.  The severity of the infection depends to a large part on the state of the infected person's [[immune system]] and whether the victim has been exposed to the strain before (in which case they would be partially immune). No one knows if these or other symptoms will be the symptoms of a humanized [[H5N1 flu]].

The [[Transmission and infection of H5N1#Human mortality rate|mortality rate]] of highly pathogenic H5N1 [[avian influenza]] in a human is high; [[World Health Organization|WHO]] data indicates that 60% of cases classified as H5N1 resulted in death. In one case, a boy with H5N1 experienced [[diarrhea]] followed rapidly by a [[coma]] without developing respiratory or flu-like symptoms.<ref name=jong>

There is no highly effective treatment for [[H5N1 flu]], but [[oseltamivir]] (commercially marketed by [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]] as '''Tamiflu'''), can sometimes inhibit the influenza virus from spreading inside the user's body.  This drug has become a focus for some governments and organizations trying to be seen as making preparations for a possible H5N1 pandemic.<ref name=Tamiflu> {{cite web

However, WHO expert Hassan al-Bushra has said:
:"Even now, we remain unsure about Tamiflu's real effectiveness. As for a [[vaccine]], work cannot start on it until the emergence of a new virus, and we predict it would take six to nine months to develop it. For the moment, we cannot by any means count on a potential vaccine to prevent the spread of a contagious influenza virus, whose various precedents in the past 90 years have been highly pathogenic".<ref name=IRIN>

There are several H5N1 [[vaccine]]s for several of the avian H5N1 varieties, but the continual mutation of H5N1 renders them of limited use to date:  while vaccines can sometimes provide  cross-protection against related flu strains, the best protection would be from a vaccine specifically produced for any future pandemic flu virus strain. Dr. Daniel Lucey, co-director of the Biohazardous Threats and Emerging Diseases graduate program at [[Georgetown University]] has made this point, "There is no H5N1 [[pandemic]] so there can be no pandemic [[vaccine]]".<ref name=schultz>

===Impact on human society===
{{main|Social impact of H5N1}}
There has been a huge impact of H5N1 on [[human]] [[society]]; especially the [[financial]], [[political]], [[social]] and [[personal]] responses to both actual and predicted [[death]]s in [[bird]]s, [[human]]s, and other [[animal]]s.

Billions of [[U.S. dollar]]s are being raised and spent to research H5N1 and prepare for a potential [[avian influenza]] [[pandemic]]. Over ten billion dollars have been lost and over two hundred million birds have been killed to try to contain H5N1. 

People have reacted by buying less chicken causing poultry sales and prices to fall.<ref> [http://www.indiaenews.com/pakistan/20060507/6960.htm  India eNews] article ''Pakistani poultry industry demands 10-year tax holiday'' published May 07, 2006 says "Pakistani poultry farmers have sought a 10-year tax exemption to support their dwindling business after the detection of the H5N1 strain of bird flu triggered a fall in demand and prices, a poultry trader said."</ref> Many individuals have stockpiled supplies for a possible flu pandemic. One of the best known experts on H5N1, Dr. [[Robert Webster]], told ABC News he had a three month supply of food and water in his house as he prepared for what he considered a reasonably likely occurrence of a major pandemic.

International health officials and other experts have pointed out that many unknown questions still hover around the disease<ref name=IISD>[http://www.iisd.ca/ymb/ais/ymbvol123num1e.html International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD)] ''SCIENTIFIC SEMINAR ON AVIAN INFLUENZA, THE ENVIRONMENT AND MIGRATORY BIRDS ON 10-11 APRIL 2006'' published 14 April 2006. </ref>

Dr. [[David Nabarro]], Chief Avian Flu Coordinator for the United Nations, and former Chief of Crisis Response for the World Health Organization has described himself as "quite scared" about the potential of H5N1's potential impact on humans. Nabarro has been accused of being alarmist before and on his first day in his role for the United Nations he  proclaimed the avian flu could kill 150 million people. In an interview with the [[International Herald Tribune]], Nabarro compares avian flu to AIDS in Africa, warning that underestimations led to innappropriate focus for research and intervention.<ref name=worrier>{{cite news

However it has been pointed out that media often focuses on "worst case" and "what if?" scenarios, which often promotes a climate of fear and "a fertile ground for speculation and rumours". Availability of reliable information is tanatamount according to WHO public health official Robert Brown. Brown downplays the significance of bird flu compared to other global public health issues:
{{quotation|In terms of death statistics so far, human avian influenza is not a huge public health issue. As Brown put it, there are 40 million people living with HIV around the world. More people die of traffic accidents in Vietnam than of avian flu.  But a mix of fear, disaster and the unknown makes avian flu a topic of concern. Other factors add to this -- that avian flu marks the arrival of a new emerging infection has a large impact on the poultry industry, a high mortality rate, and the potential to cross national boundaries.}} 

However, Brown concedes that "there are still huge gaps in our knowledge of the virus" and there has been dearth of significant breakthroughs in research since 2003. Progress stagnation can be attributed to an unwillingness for international parties to share resources and knowledge.<ref name=IPSBrown>{{cite web
