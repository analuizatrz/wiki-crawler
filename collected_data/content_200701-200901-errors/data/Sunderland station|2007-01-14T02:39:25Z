'''Sunderland station''' is a mainline and [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] station in [[Sunderland]], north-east [[England]]. It is the only station in the country where both [[heavy rail]] and [[light rail]] services use the same platforms. Although the tracks are shared north of here as far as [[Fellgate Metro station]], mainline trains do not call at any of those stations.

==Layout==
Since 2002 when the station was remodelled to accommodate Metro services the layout has been unique in the Great Britain. The station has a large central island platform with each side split into two numbered platforms. Mainline services call at platforms 1 and 4 at the northern end, while platforms 2 and 3 at the southern end are for Metro services.

==Metro services==

Metro services run at a peak of eight per hour calling at all stations. 
To the south, services run to [[South Hylton Metro station|South Hylton]] along the alignment of the Sunderland to [[Durham]] mainline that fell to the [[Beeching Axe]] in the 1960s. The first station is [[Park Lane Interchange|Park Lane]], which provides a direct interchange with the bus and coach station. 

Northbound the first station is [[St Peter's, Sunderland|St Peter's]] which is a couple of hundred yards south of the long closed [[Monkwearmouth]] station that is now a [[Monkwearmouth Station Museum|museum]]. 

The track is shared with mainline trains as far as Pelaw Metro Junction, just south of [[Pelaw Metro station]]. The former mainline stations at [[Brockley Whins Metro station|Brockley Whins]], [[East Boldon Metro station|East Boldon]], [[Seaburn Metro station|Seaburn]] are now served only by the Metro. In addition new stations at [[Fellgate Metro station|Fellgate]], the [[Stadium of Light]], and St Peter's were constructed.

On [[12 December]] [[2005]] the Yellow and Green Lines of the Metro swaped routes between Pelaw and [[South Shields]] / Sunderland and South Hylton, meaning that there is a direct rail link between Sunderland and [[Newcastle Airport]] for the first time.

==Mainline services==
The current regional operator [[Northern Rail]] provides an off-peak service of one train per hour between Sunderland and Newcastle in both directions, with many trains also running to the [[MetroCentre]] shopping centre, [[Hexham]], [[Carlisle]] and [[Middlesbrough]].

The service to [[Newcastle Central Station]] is now considered an express service, calling only at [[Heworth railway station|Heworth]], which is also served by the Metro, but the lines are segregated at this point. The former stopping service is now provided only by the Metro.

In January 2006 new operator [[Grand Central Railway|Grand Central]] was granted permission to run four trains per day from Sunderland to [[King's Cross railway station|London Kings Cross]] via [[Eaglescliffe railway station|Eaglescliffe (for Middlesbrough)]], [[Northallerton railway station|Northallerton]], [[Thirsk railway station|Thirsk]] and [[York railway station|York]]. This service is expected to begin in May 2007.

==Future developments==
It is possible that the [[Leamside line]] may be re-opened. This starts at the Pelaw Junction on the Sunderland to Newcastle line and runs through to the Tursdale junction just north of  [[Ferryhill]], [[County Durham]]. The Select Committee on Transport, Local Government and the Regions has expressed concern at the delays in determing the future of this line [http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmtlgr/603/603ap07.htm]

==Electrification==
The Tyne and Wear Metro uses overhead electrification at 1500 volts DC. This is incompatible with UK mainline electrification, which uses 25,000 volts AC. Additionally the reconstruction of the station to allow the Metro services to call here now means that [[British Rail Mark 4|Mark IV coaches]], now cannot call at the station, even if diesel hauled, as they are [[break-of-gauge|out-of-gauge]] {{fact}}.
