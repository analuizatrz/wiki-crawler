{{Hindu philosophy}}'''Yoga''' ([[Devanagari]]: योग) is one of the six schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], focusing on [[meditation]] as a path to self-knowledge and liberation. In India, Yoga is seen as a means to both physiological and spiritual mastery. Outside [[India]], Yoga has become primarily associated with the practice of [[asanas]] (postures) of [[Hatha Yoga]] (see [[Yoga as exercise]]).

A committed practitioner of yoga, traditionally held to be more spiritually developed than normal people, is referred to as a [[yogi]], [[yogin]] (masculine), or [[yogini]] (feminine).

Yoga as a means of spiritual attainment is central to the [[dharmic religions]] family and has influenced other religious and spiritual practices throughout the world. <ref name=Knitter>Zen Buddhism: A History (India and China) By Heinrich Dumoulin, James W. Heisig, Paul F. Knitter (page 13)</ref><ref>Qigong: Essence of the Healing Dance - Page 268
by Garri Garripoli</ref> [[Hindu]] texts establishing the basis for yoga include the [[Upanishads]], the [[Bhagavad Gita]], the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]], the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]] and many others. <ref name=Knitter/>

Since the Bhagavad Gita was written, the main branches of Yoga have been classified as: [[Karma Yoga]], [[Jnana Yoga]], [[Bhakti Yoga]] and [[Raja Yoga]].

The discoverer of the seal, archaeologist [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|Sir John Marshall]], named the figure ''Shiva [[Pashupati]]''.<ref>Marshall, Sir John, ''Mohenjo Daro and the Indus Civilization'', London 1931</ref>

The first known written reference to yoga is in the Rig Veda, estimated to be 3,500 years old.<ref>Frawley, David, ''Yoga and Buddhism''. Hinduism Today, February, 1998.</ref> The [[Upanishads]], (800-100 BCE), [[Bhagavad Gita]] (400-100 BCE), and the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]] (200 BCE-300 CE) also discuss the concepts and teachings of yoga.

===Etymology===
[[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|[[:wikt:yoga|yoga]]}}'' is a derivation of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''yugam'', from a root ''yeug''- (Sanskrit ''yuj-'') meaning "to join" or "unite"; cognate to [[Latin]] ''iugum'' and modern [[English Language|English]] ''yoke''.

The term is attested since the [[Rigveda]] in the sense of "act of yoking, joining, attaching, harnessing" but also "undertaking, business, performance". A mental sense of "exertion, zeal, diligence" is attested since the [[Mahabharata]], and the spiritual or mystical sense of
"abstract contemplation, meditation" likewise appears in the Mahabharata as well as in the [[Upanishad]]s.

===Bhagavad Gita===
{{Main|Bhagavad Gita}}
The Bhagavad Gita ('Song of the Lord'), thought to have been written some time between 400 and 100 BCE, talks of four branches of yoga:

*[[Karma yoga]]: The yoga of action in the world
*[[Jnana yoga]]: The yoga of Wisdom and intellectual endeavor
*[[Bhakti yoga]]: The yoga of devotion to God
*[[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyana yoga]]: The yoga of meditation

===Yoga Sutras of Patanjali===
{{main|Patanjali|Yoga Sutras of Patanjali}}
[[Image:Sivakempfort.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Statue of [[Lord Shiva]] meditating.]]
The [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]] are a book of 196 aphorisms compiled by the sage [[Patanjali]] at some time between 200 BCE and 300 CE.

In reference to the Bhagavad Gita classifications, Patanjali's yoga is a form of [[Raja yoga]], as it seeks meditation as the path towards the ultimate goal. Patanjali himself referred to it as "Ashtanga Yoga" ("Eight-Limbed Yoga"), from the eight steps he set out as the practical path towards attainment of enlightenment. This eight-limbed concept became an authoritative feature of Raja yoga from that point forward, and is a core characteristic of practically every Raja yoga variation taught today.

Patanjali's Eight Limbs of yoga practice are:
:(1) ''[[Yamas|Yama]]'' (The five "abstentions"): violence, lying, theft, (illicit) sex, and possessions
:(2) ''[[Niyama]]'' (The five "observances"): purity, contentment, austerities, study, and surrender to [[god]]
:(3) ''[[Asana]]'': Literally means "seat", and in Patanjali's Sutras refers to seated positions used for meditation. Later, with the rise of Hatha yoga, asana came to refer to all the "postures"
:(4) ''[[Pranayama]]'' ("Life Force Control"): Control of ''prāna'', life force, or vital energy
:(5) ''[[Pratyahara]]'' ("Abstraction"): Reversal of the sense organs
:(6) ''[[Dharana]]'' ("Concentration"): Fixing the attention on a single object
:(7) ''[[Dhyana]]'' ("Meditation"): Intense contemplation of the true nature of reality
:(8) ''[[Samadhi]]'' ("Liberation"): Super-conscious state of enlightenment

===Hatha Yoga Pradipika===
{{Main|Hatha yoga}}
[[Image:Yoga girl.jpg|250px|thumb|A practitioner of hatha yoga perfomring a sun salute.]]
Hatha Yoga is a particular system of Yoga introduced by [[Yogi Swatmarama]], a yogic sage of the 15th century in India, and compiler of the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]]. Hatha Yoga is a development of — but also differs substantially from — the [[Raja Yoga]] of Patanjali, in that it focuses on ''[[shatkarma]]'', the purification of the physical as leading to the purification of the mind (''ha'') and ''[[prana]]'', or vital energy (''tha'').  <ref>Living Yoga: Creating a Life Practice - Page 42 by Christy Turlington (page 42)</ref><ref>Guiding Yoga's Light: Yoga Lessons for Yoga Teachers - Page 10 by Nancy Gerstein </ref> In contrast, the Raja Yoga posited by Patanjali begins with a purification of the mind (''yamas'') and spirit (''niyamas''), then comes to the body via ''[[asana]]'' (body postures) and ''[[pranayama]]'' (breath). Hatha yoga contains substantial [[tantric]] influence, <ref>Mindfulness Yoga: The Awakened Union of Breath Body & Mind - Page 6 by Frank Jude Boccio</ref><ref>Yoga: The Indian Tradition By Ian Whicher, David Carpenter (page 8)</ref> and marks the first point at which [[chakras]] and [[kundalini]] were introduced into the yogic canon. Compared to the seated asanas of Patanjali's Raja yoga which were seen largely as a means of preparing for meditation, it also marks the development of asanas as full body 'postures' in the modern sense.<ref name=Burley/>

Hatha Yoga in its many modern variations is the style that most people actually associate with the word "Yoga" today.<ref>Feuerstein, Georg. (1996). ''The Shambhala Guide to Yoga''. Boston & London: Shambhala Publications, Inc.</ref> Because its emphasis is on the body through ''asana'' and ''pranayama'' practice, many western students are satisfied with the physical health and vitality it develops and are not interested in the other six limbs of the complete Hatha yoga teaching, or with the even older Raja Yoga tradition it is based on.

==Yoga philosophy==
In all branches of yoga, the ultimate goal is the attainment of an eternal state of perfect consciousness. Within the [[Monism|monist]] schools of [[Advaita Vedanta]] and [[Shaivism]] this perfection takes the form of ''[[Moksha]]'', which is a liberation from all worldly suffering and the cycle of birth and death ([[Samsara]]) at which point there is a cessation of thought and an experience of blissful union with the Supreme [[Brahman]]. For the dualistic [[bhakti]] schools of [[Vaishnavism]], ''bhakti'' itself is the ultimate goal of the yoga process, wherein perfection culminates in an eternal relationship with [[Vishnu]] or one of his associated [[avatar]]s such as [[Krishna]] or [[Rama]].

Common to most forms of yoga is the practice of concentration (''[[Dharana|dharana]]'') and [[meditation]] (''[[Dhyana|dhyana]]''). ''Dharana'', according to [[Patanjali|Patanjali's]] definition, is the "binding of consciousness to a single point." The awareness is concentrated on a fine point of sensation (such as that of the breath entering and leaving the nostrils). Sustained single-pointed concentration gradually leads to meditation (''dhyana''), in which the inner faculties are able to expand and merge with something vast. Meditators sometimes report feelings of peace, joy, and oneness.

The focus of '''meditation''' may differ from school to school, e.g. meditation on one of the ''[[chakra]]s'', such as the heart center (''[[anahata]]'') or the 'third eye' (''[[ajna]]''); or meditation on a particular deity, such as [[Krishna]]; or on a quality like [[peace]]. Non-dualist schools such as ''[[Advaita Vedanta]]'' may stress meditation on the Supreme with no form or qualities (''[[Nirguna Brahman]]''). This is in many ways analogous to Buddhist meditation on [[Shunyata|Emptiness]].

==Yoga in other traditions==
The goals of yoga are expressed differently in different traditions. In [[Hinduism]], with its variegated viewpoints and sects, [[Self-Realization]] and [[God-Realization]] are used interchangeably, with the underlying belief that the true nature of self (truth, consciousness, and bliss), revealed through the practice of yoga, has the same nature as the universal self, which may or may not be identified with a 'creator God' depending on the philosophical standpoint of the practitioner. In [[Buddhism]], which does not postulate a creator-type god, yoga may help people deepen their [[wisdom]], [[compassion]], and [[insight]]. In Western nations, where there is a strong emphasis on [[individualism]], yoga practice may be an extension of the search for meaning in self, and integration of the different aspects of being. 
[[Image:Yogisculpture.JPG|right|thumb|250px|A sculpture of a [[Hindu]] yogi in the [[Birla Mandir]], [[Delhi]]]]
For the average person still far from enlightenment, yoga can be a way of increasing one's spiritual awareness, or cultivating [[compassion]] and [[insight]]. While the [[history of yoga]] strongly connects it with [[Hinduism]], some proponents claim that yoga is not a religion itself, but contains practical steps which can be found in the esoteric spiritual practices of all religions, as well as those who do not consider themselves religious.

===Yoga and Buddhism===
The influence of Yoga prevades the whole of Buddhism. <ref name=Heisig>Zen Buddhism: A History (India and China) By Heinrich Dumoulin, James W. Heisig, Paul F. Knitter (page 22)</ref> In relation to views of the Self, yoga's ''asmita-samapatti'' is designed to eradicate wrong views of the Self much as Buddha did in ''Anatta-lakkhana-sutta''. Of particular interest is a comparison of the Buddhist [[eight-fold path]] and the eight limbs of Patanjali's Yoga. Their moral precepts (the ''sila'' of Buddhism, the ''yama'' and ''niyama'' of yoga) share the Hindu principle of non-violence (''ahimsa''); their final steps closely relate<ref> 6. Buddhist ''Samma Vayama'' (Effort) & Yogic ''Dharana'' (Concentration), 7. Buddhist ''Samma Sati'' (Mindfulness) & Yogic ''Dhyana'' (Meditation) and 8. Buddhist ''Samma Samadhi'' & Yogic ''Samadhi''</ref>; ultimately their steps lead to an indistinguishable goal - the cessation of mental fluctuations, ''citta vritti nirodha''. 

===Yogacara school of Buddhism===
In addition [[Yogācāra]] (Sanskrit: "yoga practice"), also spelled yogāchāra, is an influential school of philosophy and psychology that developed in [[India]]n [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]] starting sometime in the fourth to fifth centuries C.E., also commonly known as [[Consciousness-only]].
[[Image:Yogini 10th century.jpg|thumb|225px|right|A 10th century sculpture of a Yogini from the [[Smithsonian Institute]]]]

===Yoga and Zen===
Zen is a form of [[Mahayana Buddhism]]. The Mahayana school of Buddhism is noted for its proximity with Yoga. <ref name=Heisig/> In the west, Zen is often set alongside Yoga, the two schools of meditation display obvious family resemblances. <ref> Zen Buddhism: A History (India and China) By Heinrich Dumoulin, James W. Heisig, Paul F. Knitter (Page xviii) </ref> The melding of Yoga with Buddhism -- a process that continued through the centuries-- represents a landmark on the path of Yoga through the [[history of India]]. Certain essential elements of Yoga are important both for Buddhism in general and for Zen in particular. <ref name=Knitter/>

===Yoga and Tibetan Buddhism===
Yoga is central to [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. In the [[Nyingma]] tradition, practicioners progress to increasingly profound levels of yoga, starting with [[Mahayoga|Mahā yoga]], continuing to [[Anuyoga|Anu yoga]] and ultimately undertaking the highest practice, [[Atiyoga|Ati yoga]]. In the [[Sarma]] traditions, the [[Anuttara yoga]] class is equivalent. Other tantra yoga practices include a system of 108 bodily postures practiced with breath and heart rhythm timing in movement exercises is known as [[Trul khor]] or union of moon and sun (channel) prajna energies, and the body postures of Tibetan ancient yogis are depicted on the walls of the Dalai Lama's summer temple of [[Lukhang]].

===Yoga and Tantra===
{{Main|Tantra}}
Yoga is often mentioned in company with [[Tantra]], and it is true that these traditions have influenced one another over time. They are both families of spiritual texts, practices, and lineages with origins in the Indian subcontinent and both have been popularized in the West.<ref>Mindfulness Yoga: The Awakened Union of Breath Body & Mind - Page 6 by Frank Jude Boccio</ref><ref>Yoga: The Indian Tradition By Ian Whicher, David Carpenter (page 8)</ref>

Tantra has roots in the first millennium, and incorporates [[Shiva]] and [[Shakti]] worship. It focuses on the [[kundalini]], a three and a half-coiled 'snake' of spiritual energy at the base of the spine that rises through [[chakras]] until [[union]] ('[[samadhi]]') between Shiva and Shakti is ultimately achieved.<ref>Tantric Yoga: The Royal Path to Raising Kundalini Power By Gavin Frost, Yvonne Frost</ref> These concepts were formally introduced into yoga with the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]], and because of the subsequent popularity of Hatha Yoga, many Hindu and western yoga teachers now accept these essentially tantric concepts within the yogic philosophy, and this is the most obvious major intersection between tantra and yoga today. The acceptance of tantric kundalini teachings into modern yoga was reinforced by the [[New Age]] movement which accompanied (and simultaneously reinforced) the rise of popularity of yoga in the West.<ref name=Burley/>

The actual method of Tantra is quite different to traditional Raja Yoga. It emphasises [[mantra]] (Sanskrit prayers, often to gods, that are repeated), [[yantra]] (complex symbols and archetypal geometric pattering or [[sacred geometry]] housing [[deity]], manifesting in a plethora of forms with a discernable syntactic pattern), and rituals that range from simple [[murti]] (a statue housing a deity) or image worship to meditation on a corpse or of [[coitus]] in a [[charnel]] ground - which is challenging for some, but simply an active meditation with the intention to resolve the perceived duality of the creative and destructive universal principle.
