'''Ian James Thorpe [[Order of Australia Medal|OAM]]''' (born [[October 13]], [[1982]]), also known as the '''''Thorpedo''''' or '''''Thorpey''''', is a former [[Australia|Australian]] [[Freestyle swimming|freestyle]] [[Swimming|swimmer]] who is regarded as one of the greatest freestyle swimmers of all time. He has won five [[Olympic Games]] gold medals, the most won by any Australian and, in [[2001 World Aquatics Championships|2001]], became the only person to have won six gold medals in one World Championships.<ref>{{cite book | last= Hunter | first= Greg| title=Ian Thorpe: The Biography |publisher= [[MacMillan]] |id=ISBN 1-4050-3632-X|year=2004| pages=404 |location=[[Sydney]]}} pp274-275</ref> In total, Thorpe has won eleven World Championship golds, the highest number of any swimmer.<ref name="gsiprofile">{{cite web | url = http://www.grandslamint.com/PlayerProfile/PlayerProfile.aspx?p=3&id=7 | title = Ian Thorpe | publisher = Grand Slam International | accessdate = 2006-11-14}}</ref>  Thorpe is the only person to have been named [[Swimming World Swimmers of the Year|World Swimmer of the Year]] four times by ''[[Swimming World magazine]]'',<ref>Hunter (2004), p viii</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Swimming World's - World Swimmers of the Year| date= [[2005]] |accessdate = 2006-11-14 | publisher=[[Swimming World magazine]] | url=http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/SwimmersOfTheYear.asp}}</ref> and was the Australian swimmer of the year from 1999 to 2003. His athletic achievements made him Australia's most popular athlete, with his philanthropy and clean image earning him further recognition as the [[Australian of the Year|Young Australian of the Year]] in 2000.<ref name="gsiprofile"/>

At the age of 14, he became the youngest male ever to represent Australia,<ref>Hunter (2004), p75</ref> and his victory in the 400&nbsp;[[metre]] freestyle a few months later at the [[1998 World Aquatics Championships|1998 Perth World Championships]] made him the youngest ever individual male World Champion.<ref>p102</ref><ref name ="andrews">{{cite book | last= Andrews | first= Malcolm| title = Australia at the Olympics |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]| location = [[Sydney]]|year=2000|pages=487|id=ISBN 0-7333-0884-8 }} pp434-436</ref> After that victory, Thorpe dominated the 400&nbsp;m freestyle, winning the event at every Olympic, World, [[Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth]] and [[Pan Pacific Swimming Championships]] until his break after the 2004 Olympics.<ref name="abc career">{{cite news| url = http://www.abc.net.au/sport/columns/200611/s1793724.htm?swimming | title = Ian Thorpe - Career at a glance| publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date = [[2006-11-21]]| accessdate = 2006-11-22}}</ref> Aside from 13 individual long-course world records,<ref>Hunter (2004), p viii</ref> Thorpe anchored the Australian relay teams, numbering the victories in the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100&nbsp;m and the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;200&nbsp;m freestyle relays in Sydney, among his five relay world records.<ref name="abc career"/> His wins in the 200&nbsp;m and 400&nbsp;m and his bronze in the 100&nbsp;m freestyle in Athens have made him the only person to have won medals in the 100-200-400 combination.<ref name="abc career"/>

After the Athens Olympics, Thorpe took a year away from swimming, scheduling a return for the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Melbourne]]. However, he was forced to withdraw due to a bout of [[glandular fever]]. Subsequent training camps in the [[United States]] were interrupted, and he announced his retirement from competition on [[November 21]], [[2006]] at the age of 24, citing waning motivation.<ref name="abc retire">{{cite news |first = |last = |title = Thorpe announces retirement |url = http://www.abc.net.au/sport/content/200611/s1793622.htm |format =  |publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date = [[2006-10-21]] |accessdate = 2006-11-21 |language = }}</ref>
==Early years==
Thorpe was a large baby, weighing 4.1kilograms and measuring 59centimetres in length at birth. He grew up in a family with a sporting pedigree in the suburb of Milperra.<ref name ="dyk">{{cite news |title = Did you know?|url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/sport/a-career-that-sets-the-gold-standard/2006/11/21/1163871405639.html |publisher = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date = [[2006-11-22]] |accessdate = 2006-11-22 |language = }}</ref> Thorpe's father, Ken, was a promising [[cricketer]] at junior level, representing [[Bankstown, New South Wales|Bankstown]] cricket club in Sydney's grade competition. Ken achieved selection for Bankstown before his teammates [[Len Pascoe]] and [[Jeff Thomson]], who became long serving members of the [[Australian cricket team]].<ref name ="dyk"/><ref name ="smh early">{{cite news |first=Michael|last=Cowley|title = A career that sets the gold standard|url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/sport/a-career-that-sets-the-gold-standard/2006/11/21/1163871405639.html |publisher = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date = [[2006-11-22]] |accessdate = 2006-11-22 |language = }}</ref> A talented batman, he once topped the season's bat averages in the latter stages of his car ahead of former Australian captain. However, paternal pressure from Ken's father Cecil detracted from his enjoyment, and Ken walked away from the sport at age 26. Thorpe's mother Margaret competed for Bankstown in A-grade [[netball]],<ref name ="smh early">{{cite news |first=Michael|last=Cowley|title = A career that sets the gold standard|url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/sport/did-you-know/2006/11/21/1163871405651.html |publisher = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date = [[2006-11-22]] |accessdate = 2006-11-22 |language = }}</ref><ref> Hunter (2004), pp1-6</ref> but Thorpe did not seem to inherit his parents' ball skills. His elder sister, Christina, had been given medical advice that swimming would strengthen her wrist, which she had broken in a backyard accident, so by chance, the five-year old Thorpe followed her in taking swimming lessons at [[Padstow, New South Wales|Padstow]] swimming pool.<ref name ="smh early"/><ref>Hunter (2004), p102</ref> Due to his unhappy sporting experience, Ken Thorpe always maintained that enjoyment was the most important aspect of his children's participation in sport.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp1-6</ref>

As a young child, Thorpe was sidelined due to a [[chlorine]] allergy.<ref name ="andrews"/> Because of this, he did not swim in his first race until age seven (at a school carnival). His allergy forced him to swim with his head out of the water; despite this ungainly technique, he won the race, primarily because of his significant size advantage.<ref name ="dyk"/><ref>Hunter (2004), p19-22</ref> Thorpe gradually overcame the allergy and progressed to the captaincy of New South Wales for the Australian Primary Schools titles in [[1994]]. He subsequently justified his appointment to the role by winning nine individual gold medals in his age division at the State Age Short Course Championships in September of that year.<ref>Hunter (2004), p36-39</ref> In [[1995]] he started his secondary education at [[East Hills Boys Technology High School]],<ref name ="dyk"/> switching coaches to swim alongside his sister under the tutelage of [[Doug Frost]]. It was a big year for his family, with Christina being selected for the national team to compete at the [[1995 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships]] in [[Atlanta]]. Ian, who had now grown to six feet, competed at his first National Age Championships against 13 year olds, winning bronze medals in the 200&nbsp;m and 400&nbsp;m freestyle. He subsequently won all ten events at the State Age Championships later that year.<ref name ="andrews"/><ref>{{cite book | last= Talbot | first= Don| authorlink = Don Talbot|coauthors= Kevin Berry and Ian Heads |publisher=Lothian |place=[[Melbourne]]|year=2003| title=Talbot: Nothing But the Best | pages= 302|id=ISBN 0-7344-0512-X}} pp224-225</ref><ref>Hunter (2004), pp46-49</ref>

== National debut ==
Thorpe competed at the [[1996 in sports|1996]] National Age Championships in [[Brisbane]], winning five gold, two silver and two bronze medals.<ref name="abc career"/> His winning times were on average two seconds per hundred metres faster than those of the silver medalist, with his 400&nbsp;m freestyle and 200&nbsp;m backstroke times qualifying him for the Australian Championships, which were qualifying events for the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]]. Frost knew that Thorpe had no realistic chance of finishing among the top two on a distance, which would mean Olympic selection at only 13 years and 6 months of age, but sent him to [[Sydney]] to gain racing experience at the senior national level.

Thorpe missed selection as expected, finishing 23rd in the 400&nbsp;m freestyle and 36th in the 200&nbsp;m backstroke.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp65-70</ref> By the end of the year, he had grown to 190&nbsp;cm (6&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]&nbsp;3&nbsp;[[inch|in]]) and 90&nbsp;kg in weight, and had also achieved qualification for the Australian Short Course Championships. It was another chance for Thorpe to gain national selection, as they were the trials for the [[1997 FINA Short Course World Championships]] in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]]. He qualified in second place for his first national final in the 400&nbsp;m individual medley, but swam more slowly in the final to miss selection.

1997 began at the New South Wales Championships in January, where he finished second behind [[Malcolm Allen]] in the 400&nbsp;m freestyle. His time of 3&nbsp;min 59.43&nbsp;s, took eight seconds off his personal best, and was the first time under four minutes  by a 14-year old in Australia. Thorpe was ranked fourth among all Australian swimmers on the distance <!-- right? --> after this performance.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp72-73</ref>

Thorpe went into the [[1997 in sports|1997]] Australian Championships in [[Adelaide]] as a serious contender for Australian selection to the [[1997 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships]] in [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]], [[Japan]]. With a top-three finish and a specific qualifying time required, Thorpe made the final in both the 400&nbsp;m individual medley and freestyle. Thorpe and Frost decided to withdraw from the medley event to conserve energy for the freestyle final after injuries to the 400&nbsp;m freestyle Olympic medallists [[Kieren Perkins]] and [[Daniel Kowalski]]. Thorpe went on to win bronze behind 16-year old Queenslander [[Grant Hackett]] and Allen, setting a new personal best of 3&nbsp;min 53.44&nbsp;s. The time was a new world age record and the first of many battles with Hackett.

Aged 14 years and 5 months, Thorpe became the youngest male ever to be selected for the Australian team,<ref name ="andrews"/> surpassing [[John Konrads]]' record by one month.<ref name = "ABC profile">{{cite news | title=Ian Thorpe: On course to sink Athens opposition | date= [[2004]] |accessdate = 2006-11-14 | publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] | url=http://abc.net.au/olympics/2004/profiles/ianthorpe.htm}}</ref> Frost cited Thorpe's selection as a cause for his eventual focus on freestyle.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp73-75</ref> Thorpe continued his good form at the National Age Championships a fortnight later where he contested all twelve events, winning ten individual gold and two bronze medals, and setting six national records in the process.<ref name ="smh early"/><ref>Hunter (2004), pp75-76</ref>

== International debut ==
In June, two months before the [[1997 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships]], Thorpe required an appendix operation, causing him to miss two weeks of training.<ref> Hunter (2004), p82</ref> With the absence of qualification rules for specific events in [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]], Thorpe opted to register in the 200&nbsp;m freestyle and [[butterfly swimming|butterfly]] as well as the 400&nbsp;m individual [[medley swimming|medley]] and freestyle. He came fourth in his heat of the 200&nbsp;m freestyle after setting another personal best of 1&nbsp;min 51.46&nbsp;s. Despite his failure to qualify for the final, he earnt selection for the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;200&nbsp;m freestyle relay team. There he combined with [[Michael Klim]], [[Ian van der Wal]] and Hackett to claim silver, making him the youngest ever Pan Pacific medalist. Thorpe then qualified for his first individual final at international level in the 400&nbsp;m freestyle, proceeding to come from fifth at the 300&nbsp;m mark to claim silver behind Hackett in a time of 3&nbsp;min 49.64&nbsp;s.<ref name ="andrews"/><ref name="andrews h"> Malcolm (2000), pp191-192</ref> His finishing burst was to become a trademark, and his time, which ranked him third in the world would have given him silver at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta Olympics]].<ref name ="smh early"/><ref>Hunter (2004), p75</ref> In October 1997, a few days before his fifteenth birthday, Thorpe competed in qualifying trials in [[Brisbane]] for the [[1998 World Aquatics Championships]]. Thorpe gained selection for the Championships in [[Perth, Western Australia]] in January by finishing fourth and second respectively in the 200&nbsp;m and 400&nbsp;m freestyle. He continued his improvement by setting new personal best times in both events.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp91-92</ref>

Thorpe's first international appearance on his home soil, at the [[1998 World Aquatics Championships|1998 World Championships]] in Perth, began with the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;200&nbsp;m freestyle relay. Thorpe secured a position for the team after posting a time of 1&nbsp;min 48.85&nbsp;s with a flying start in the heats.In the final, Klim, who had earlier become the 200&nbsp;m freestyle world champion, developed a lead which Hackett maintained, passing a half-body-length lead over the Americans. Thorpe broke away from 200&nbsp;m butterfly Olympic champion, [[Tom Malchow]], to set a split time of 1&nbsp;min 47.67&nbsp;s, the same as Klim's winning time in the 200&nbsp;m final. By the end of Thorpe's leg, Australia were two seconds ahead of the world record pace, and three seconds ahead of the Americans. Although anchorman Kowalski finished half a second outside the world record, it was the first time that Australia had won the event at global level since [[1956 in sports|1956]].<ref name="abc career"/> Having secured his first world title, Thorpe went into the 400&nbsp;m final ranked fourth in the world, behind [[Emiliano Brembilla]], Hackett and [[Massimiliano Rosolino]] of Italy. Hackett lead from the outset, establishing a comfortable 2.29&nbsp;s lead over Thorpe by the 300&nbsp;m mark. Although Thorpe reduced the margin to 1.53&nbsp;s at the 350&nbsp;m mark, Hackett was still on course for victory until Thorpe gained 1.68&nbsp;s in the last 50&nbsp;m to pass Hackett on the final stroke. Thorpe's time of 3&nbsp;min 46.29&nbsp;s was the fourth fastest in history and made him the youngest ever male individual world champion.<ref name ="andrews"/><ref name ="andrews h"/><ref>Hunter (2004), pp96-102</ref>

As a result of the media attention generated by his win on home soil, Thorpe received multiple offers for television commercials and was mobbed by autograph hunters. He became a high-profile supporter of the [[Children's Cancer Institute]], after his sister Christina's brother-in-law to be became gravely ill with the disease. After the World Championships, Thorpe announced that he would complete his Year 10 studies by correspondence, an announcement that attracted public criticism. He cited disappointment after his grades had deteriorated due to the burden of his international swimming commitments in 1997. Sporting and commercial commitments were only to increase as his career developed, leading to his education finishing at Year 10.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp95-102</ref>

Thorpe returned to the water in March at the Australian Championships in [[Melbourne]], which were selection trials for the [[1998 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Malaysia]]. Thorpe's improvement continued when he defeated world champion Klim in the 200&nbsp;m freestyle in 1&nbsp;min 47.24&nbsp;s, faster than Klim's World Championship winning time two months earlier. Despite trailing by over a body-length at the 150&nbsp;m mark, Thorpe accelerated past Klim in the last 50&nbsp;m to post a time that was more than a second faster than his effort in Perth. His effort was a Commonwealth record and secured Thorpe's first national title. He then claimed the 400&nbsp;m freestyle title from Hackett and clocked 50.36&nbsp;s in the 100&nbsp;m freestyle. His time earned silver in his first 100&nbsp;m race at the national level, gaining him Commonwealth selection in three individual events.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp110-113</ref> He went on the European summer tour to compete in the [[Mare Nostrum]] series, complementing his Australian success by winning the 200-400&nbsp;m double in all three meetings at [[Monte Carlo]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Canet]].<ref>Hunter (2004), pp117-118</ref>

Thorpe's rise continued when the Australians arrived in [[Kuala Lumpur]] during September for the Commonwealth Games. Thorpe's first event was the 200&nbsp;m freestyle, where he lead throughout to record a time of 1&nbsp;min 46.70&nbsp;s, just one hundredth outside [[Giorgio Lamberti]]'s world record. He then combined with Klim, Kowalski and [[Matt Dunn]] in the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;200&nbsp;m freestyle relay to break the world record of the [[Unified Team]] set at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] by 0.09&nbsp;s.<ref>{{cite news |first = |title = 1998 Commonwealth Games  |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/636.asp |publisher = [[Swimming World magazine]] |date = [[1998-09-25]] |accessdate = 2006-11-21 |language = }}</ref> Thorpe's run ended when a personal best of 50.21&nbsp;s in the 100&nbsp;m freestyle was only sufficient for fourth place, but he returned to victory with the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100&nbsp;m freestyle relay team. He claimed a fourth gold in the 400&nbsp;m freestyle, setting another personal best of 3&nbsp;min 44.35&nbsp;s, just 0.55&nbsp;s slower than Kieren Perkins' [[1994 in sports|1994]] mark (regarded by some as the greatest swim in history).<ref name="abc career"/><ref>{{cite news |first = |title = 1998 Commonwealth Games: Day 4 |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/637.asp |publisher = [[Swimming World magazine]] |date = [[1998-09-26]] |accessdate = 2006-11-21 |language = }}</ref><ref name ="andrews"/><ref>Hunter (2004), pp121-123</ref>

Thorpe left school at the end of year after completing Year 10. His decision caused consternation amongst those who believed that concentrating on swimming alone would be detrimental, with [[Stephen Holland]] stating "If this kid just does swimming and nothing else, he won't last beyond the Sydney Olympics". Holland himself had broken world records since the age of 15 and was expected to win the 1500&nbsp;m freestyle at the [[1976 Montreal Olympics]], but retired from the sport in despair after concentrating only on swimming and failing to win. Thorpe disagreed, pointing to his informal search for knowledge using books and the internet, stating that "Swimming is a small part of my life". He eventually sat for his School Certificate on a flight to a [[FINA World Cup]] meet in 1999, meticulously supervised by former school teacher and Australian head coach [[Don Talbot]]. At the end of the year, Thorpe's impact in the swimming community was acknowledged when he became the youngest male swimmer to be named by ''[[Swimming World magazine]]'' as the [[Swimming World Swimmers of the Year|World Swimmer of the Year]].<ref>Hunter (2004), pp130-133</ref>

== 1999 Pan Pacific Championships == 
[[1999 in sports|1999]] began with heavy media expectations that Thorpe would inevitably break both 200&nbsp;m and 400&nbsp;m world records, given his continuing physical growth. The first opportunity came in late March at the 1999 Australian Championships in Brisbane, which doubled as a selection event for the [[1999 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships]]. Thorpe again swam in the 400&nbsp;m with his usual tactic of kicking away from Hackett in the last 150&nbsp;m, but Perkins' record eluded him, this time by just 0.05&nbsp;s. Hackett, who was still hurting after being dropped from the world-record breaking relay team the previous year, turned the tables in the 200&nbsp;m event, passing Thorpe in the final 50&nbsp;m to win Thorpe's title.<ref name ="andrews h"/> Although both were outside Lamberti's mark, Hackett went on to break it the following night in a relay event.<ref>{{cite news |first = |title = Hackett Breaks 200m Freestyle World Record |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/817.asp |publisher = [[Swimming World magazine]] |date = [[1999-03-24]] |accessdate = 2006-11-21 |language = }}</ref> Thorpe finished the Championships by continuing his improvement in the 100&nbsp;m freestyle, posting a time of 49.98&nbsp;s, his first under the 50&nbsp;s barrier. The Australians immediately travelled onto [[Hong Kong]] for the [[1999 FINA Short Course World Championships]], where Thorpe broke Lamberti's nine-year-old world record in the 200&nbsp;m freestyle, the oldest world record. However, Hackett again interrupted his winning streak by relegating him to silver in the 400&nbsp;m event, cutting 5&nbsp;s from the time Thorpe had set the previous year.<ref name ="andrews"/><ref>Hunter (2004), pp137-139</ref>

The [[1999 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships]] were held in August [[1999 in sports|1999]] at [[Sydney Olympic Park]], and were viewed as a rehearsal for the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] to be held in the same venue with an identical schedule. With Thorpe expected to deliver world records, it was the first time that the event was shown live on Australian television. It was Thorpe's first international meet in his home town. The opening night saw him pitted against Hackett and [[South Africa]]'s [[Ryk Neethling]] in the 400&nbsp;m freestyle final. The race began steadily with the trio reaching the 200&nbsp;m mark in a group, on the world record pace. Thereafter, Thorpe accelerated away, taking a full body length lead in the next 40&nbsp;m, and recording a split time 1.86&nbsp;s ahead of world-record pace at 300&nbsp;m. He extended his lead to four body lengths by the 350&nbsp;m mark and finished in a time of 3&nbsp;min 41.83&nbsp;s, cutting almost two seconds from the world record,<ref name="abc career"/> and covering the second half in almost the same time as the first.<ref name ="firstwr">{{cite news |first = Stephen J.|last= Thomas|title = 1999 Pan Pacific Championships: Day 1 |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/981.asp |publisher = [[Swimming World magazine]] |date = [[1999-08-22]] |accessdate = 2006-11-21 |language = }}</ref> Talbot reacted to the performance by dubbing Thorpe as "the greatest swimmer we've [Australia] ever had", whilst four-time American Olympic gold medalist [[Rowdy Gaines]], commentating for [[NBC]] said "..he went into a balls-out sprint at at 250 - and I have never seen anything like that...I have been around swimming a long time and it's the most amazing swim I've ever seen, hands down." A formula used by the International Swimming Statisticians Association to compare world records in different events gave his performance the highest score of all current world records. Thorpe promptly donated his A$25,000 bonus for being the first person to break a world record in the pool to charity.<ref name ="andrews"/><ref name="gsiprofile"/> Later the same night, Thorpe anchored the Australians to a historic victory in the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100&nbsp;m freestyle final, the first time the United States had been defeated in the event. After diving into the pool an arm's length ahead of [[Jason Lezak]], he pulled away to set an Australian record relay split of 48.55&nbsp;s.

== 2000 Olympic build-up ==
Thorpe started [[2000 in sports|2000]] looking to add a third individual event to his Olympic schedule<!-- to be performed in front of an expectant home crowd-->. He explored his options by contesting the 1500&nbsp;m freestyle at the New South Wales Championships in January, which he won. He then embarked on a European [[FINA World Cup]] tour in order to hone his racecraft, but this was overshadowed by comments made by German head coach [[Manfred Thiesmann]]. Thiesmann implied that Thorpe was using steroids, stating "We all know Lamberti was pumped up and his times stood for ages, but Thorpe is not only passing them - he's passing them by seconds".<ref name = "Talbot blood"> Talbot (2003) p156</ref> The Australian delegation pointed to Thorpe's clean record, while ''Swimming World'' editor-in-chief, Phillip Whitten, stated his belief that Thorpe was clean: "There is absolutely no reason to suspect Ian Thorpe is doping. Detailed underwater stroke analysis shows he has extraordinary technique. In addition, he exhibits none of the physical signs of drug use. His physical attributes, natural talent, excellent coaching and superior technique account entirely for his superb performances."<ref name="swiminfo tech">{{cite news |title = World Cup VIII: German Coach Accuses Thorpe of Doping |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/1192.asp |publisher = [[Swimming World magazine]] |date = [[2000-02-03]] |accessdate = 2006-11-21 |language = }}</ref> Thorpe's difficulties heightened at the subsequent [[Germany|German]] leg of the tour in [[Berlin]], when he and American [[backstroke]] World Champion [[Lenny Krayzelburg]] were drug-tested. Unable to locate the required containers, the testing officials asked the swimmers for permission to have their samples left unsealed in a fridge overnight against the security protocol for drug testing, permission that was refused by the Australian and US officials.

Thorpe and Frost travelled to [[Colorado]] for a month of altitude training away from Australian media, but could not escape the attention of American coaches who timed each of Thorpe's work-outs.

Entering the Olympics, the Australian public expected Thorpe to deliver multiple world records and gold medals as a formality; Sydney's ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' posted a front page spread headlined ''Invincible''. Thorpe cruised through the heats of the 400&nbsp;m on the first morning of competition and still managed to post a new Olympic record,<ref>{{cite news |first=Phillip|last= Whitten|title =Olympic Day 1 Prelims - Complete |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/1781.asp |publisher = [[Swimming World magazine]] |date = [[2000-09-16]] |accessdate = 2006-11-21 |language = }}</ref> shortening bookmakers' odds to 50-1. By the time the final was held that night, the pressure had intensified &mdash; the host nation had yet to win its first gold medal. Thorpe lead throughout, and although [[Italy]]'s [[Massimiliano Rosolino]] was within a body-length at the 300&nbsp;m mark, Thorpe's finishing kick extended the final margin to three body-lengths.

[[Image:Thorpe relay.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Thorpe ''(right)'' and his teammates celebrate victory in the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100&nbsp;m freestyle relay.]]
Thorpe lined up later in the night alongside Klim, [[Chris Fydler]] and [[Ashley Callus]] to anchor the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100&nbsp;m freestyle relay, an event which the Americans had never lost at Olympic level. After Klim had broken the individual world record, Fydler and Callus clung onto the arm-length lead, with Thorpe ready to duel with [[Gary Hall Jr.]]. Thorpe timed his dive much better than Hall, and surfaced a body-length ahead of the silver medalist in the 100&nbsp;m from the Atlanta Olympics. Hall opened a half a body-length lead in the first lap, but Thorpe used his finishing kick in the last 40&nbsp;m to claim victory by just 0.17&nbsp;s and set a new world record.<ref name="abc career"/><ref name ="oly2000 d1"/> It sparked wild celebrations amongst the partisan crowd, and evoked an uncharacteristic celebration from Thorpe. Whereas he would usually stare calmly at the scoreboard and slowly pump his fists, he immediately jumped out of the pool, screaming and hugging his ecstatic teammates. He even went as far as playing [[air guitar]] to mock Hall's pre-race claim that the Americans would "smash" the Australians ''like guitars''. Talbot described the race as the "greatest moment" of his coaching career, but felt that the emotional euphoria negatively impacted the subsequent performance of his team.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp218-225</ref><ref>Talbot (2003) pp194-195</ref>

I just want to make a medal and stand on the podium." However, Van den Hoogenband showed his hand in the evening semi-finals by cutting more than a second off his personal best, breaking Thorpe's record by 0.16&nbsp;s to set a new benchmark of 1&nbsp;min 45.35&nbsp;s.

However, as a result of starting harder than usual, Thorpe was unable to produce his trademark finishing kick, and van den Hoogenband drew away to claim gold and equal his world record.

With the [[2001 in sports|2001]] Australian Championships held in [[Hobart]] in March, Thorpe added the 800&nbsp;m freestyle to his repertoire, after [[FINA]] had added the event for the [[2001 World Aquatics Championships]].

Thorpe arrived in [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]] under immense pressure, having been chosen by broadcaster [[TV Asahi]] as the marketing drawcard of the event with his face visible throughout the country. With the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100&nbsp;m freestyle relay being held after the 400&nbsp;m freestyle on the first night, Thorpe appeared to be conserving energy when he reached the 200&nbsp;m mark two seconds outside his world record.

The relay saw him in exactly the same position as in previous years, diving in fractionally ahead of American [[Jason Lezak]] after Klim, Callus and Pearson had completed the first three legs.

== 2002 Commonwealth Games and Pan Pacific Championships ==
Thorpe began competition in [[2002 in sports|2002]] at the Australian Championships in [[Brisbane]] in March, which were used to select the team for the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]] and the [[2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships]]. After his record six gold medals in Fukuoka, the meet was surrounded by further expectations of world records and speculation that he would match [[Mark Spitz|Spitz]]'s seven gold medals. His winning time of 3&nbsp;min 40.54&nbsp;s was the second fastest time in history, but such was the expectation on him that the ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' ran the headline "Newsflash:Ian Thorpe did not break a world record". He went on to claim the 200&nbsp;m event in a time one second slower than his best before claiming the 100&nbsp;m in 48.98&nbsp;s, making it the first time since 1999 that he had failed to break a world record at a major meet.<ref name="swiminfo 2002">{{cite news |first = Phillip|last = Whitten|title = 2002 Year in Review |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/2002_year_in_review.asp |publisher = [[Swimming World magazine]] |date = [[2006-12-30]] |accessdate = 2006-11-21 |language = }}</ref> He also experimented by adding the 100&nbsp;m backstroke to his repertoire, coming second in a time of 55.74&nbsp;s.

By this time, Thorpe's relationship with Frost was beginning to unravel. Thorpe had always insisted that his swimming was about enjoyment and improving himself in setting faster times, rather than victory or defeat. This contrasted with Frost, who had a more aggressive and combative mindset, often making bold public statements. Thorpe ignored Frost's advice in the lead up to the Commonwealth Games and bulked up his upper body by a further 5&nbsp;kg to 105&nbsp;kg, making him the heaviest elite swimmer in history. His reasoning that the strength gains would outweigh any loss in flexibility raised media concerns over his physiological strategy.<ref>Talbot (2003), pp228-229</ref> On the first night in Manchester, Thorpe again lowered his 400&nbsp;m mark by 0.09&nbsp;s to 3&nbsp;min 40.08&nbsp;s,<ref name="abc career"/><ref name="swiminfo 2002"/> before anchoring the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100&nbsp;m freestyle relay team to another gold.<ref name="bbc cg2002">{{cite news |title = Thorpe's six of the best |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/commonwealthgames2002/hi/swimming/newsid_2166000/2166261.stm | publisher = [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |date = [[2006-08-02]] |accessdate = 2006-11-21 |language = }}</ref> The following night, prior to the 200&nbsp;m final, Thorpe was seen arguing with Frost in the warm-up area over Frost's strategy of focusing on the opposition.

The [[2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships]] followed in [[Yokohama]] less than a month later with media speculation about Thorpe and Frost overshadowing the racing. Thorpe began his campaign with a victory over Hackett in the 400&nbsp;m freestyle in a pedestrian time five seconds outside world record pace. Afterwards, he revealed that both swimmers had deliberately conserved energy for the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100&nbsp;m freestyle relay later in the night.

Along with the switch of coaches, Thorpe indicated that he would change his focus to try and improve his sprinting performance in the 100&nbsp;m freestyle. He thus dropped the 800&nbsp;m freestyle from his schedule despite being the reigning world champion and record holder. His sprinting capacity showed signs of improvement at the [[FINA World Cup]] event in December 2002 in [[Melbourne]], where he set a personal best in the 50&nbsp;m freestyle. He subsequently participated in the European legs of the [[FINA World Cup]] in January 2003 in an attempt to bring his new training regime to fruition under race conditions. He came within one second of the 200&nbsp;m and 0.05&nbsp;s of the 400&nbsp;m freestyle world records as well as setting the sixth fastest ever time in the 200&nbsp;m individual medley. He had come within 1.35&nbsp;s of the world record in his first international race in the event. The first major test of Thorpe's partnership with Menzies came at the Australian Championships held in [[Sydney]] in March, with the public waiting to see the results produced by his new coach. Thorpe did not threaten any of his world records, completing the 400&nbsp;m and 200&nbsp;m freestyle more than two and one seconds respectively off his best. Although he still managed to hold off Hackett in both races to retain his titles,<ref>{{cite news |first = Stephen J.|last = Thomas|title = Aussie Champs: Jones Lowers Breast Mark Again, Thorpe Unhappy With 8th Fastest 200 Free|url= http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/5172.asp|publisher = [[Swimming World magazine]] |date =[[2003-03-24]] |accessdate = 2006-11-20 |language = }}</ref> he later admitted that he was "pretty disappointed" with his performances. Prior to the 100&nbsp;m race, Thorpe announced that after his sprint training, he would aim to post a time equivalent to his Pan Pacific relay split of 47.20&nbsp;s. When he only managed to tie with [[Ashley Callus]] in a time of 49.05&nbsp;s,<ref>{{cite news |first = Stephen J.|last = Thomas|title = Thorpe, Callus Tie in 100&nbsp;m Free at Aussie Trials |url= http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/5182.asp| |publisher = [[Swimming World magazine]] |date =[[2003-03-25]] |accessdate = 2006-11-20 |language = }}</ref> he was criticised, with the '' [[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' stating "The measure of Thorpe's sprinting ability is that he could only match the efforts of a virus-riddled Callus".

Thorpe arrived for the [[2003 World Aquatics Championships|2003 World Championships]] in [[Barcelona]] (his first major competition since Menzies appointment) under heavy media scrutiny following his failure to improve his times at the Australian Championships.

After his feats at the 2003 World Championships, [[Speedo]] had generated significant media publicity by offering Michael Phelps USD 1 million if he could match Spitz's seven golds. Thorpe was adamant that this was impossible, and scrapped his seventh event, the 200&nbsp;m individual medley from his Olympic program.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp349-350</ref> In late March [[2004 in sports|2004]] at the Australian Championships in [[Sydney]], Thorpe lined up in the heats of the 400&nbsp;m freestyle, but overbalanced whilst on the blocks and fell into the water, resulting in his disqualification.<ref name="abc career"/> An attempted appeal, asserting that a noise had caused him to make his mistake, was dismissed, ending his chance to defend the 400&nbsp;m Olympic title. This prompted widespread debate, with former swimmer [[Shane Gould]] asserting that the selection policy should be relaxed to maximise Australia's chances by selecting Thorpe, whilst Talbot, head coach [[Leigh Nugent]] and [[Kieren Perkins]] defended the selection policy. Public debate was also widespread, with [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[John Howard]] describing the situation as a "tragedy".<ref>{{cite news |first = Jacquelin|last = Magnay|title = I'm over it already, says a gracious Thorpe |url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/17/1037490052340.html | publisher = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date = [[2004-03-24]] |accessdate = 2006-11-14 |language = }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first = Mark|last = Bannerman|title = Thorpe's tumble divides nation |url = http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2004/s1076520.htm |publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date = [[2004-03-29]] |accessdate = 2006-11-14 |language = }}</ref> Despite the intense media spotlight, Thorpe managed to win the 100&nbsp;m and 200&nbsp;m freestyle events in times of 48.83s and 1&nbsp;min 45.07s respectively to ensure his selection for Athens.

Although Thorpe said that Stevens should not be pressured into stepping aside, he was also criticised by columnists who felt that he was inherently pressuring Stevens, for not unequivocally ruling himself out.

[[Image:Ian Thorpe dq.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Thorpe overbalances on the blocks during the heats of the 400&nbsp;m freestyle at the 2004 Australian Championships, resulting in disqualification for causing a false start.]]

The pressure in the lead-up was further compounded by the media attention surrounding Phelps, who had decided that the 200&nbsp;m freestyle would be one of the events in his quest for eight gold medals. This prompted many media outlets to label the race between Thorpe, van den Hoogenband, Phelps and Hackett as ''The Race of the Century''. With the media spotlight growing, Thorpe tried to avoid media attention, tersely stating at the pre-Olympics training camp in [[Germany]] that "If I'm stepping on people's toes, they can live with that, because I have to race at the Olympics and I'm being selfish because that's what I need to do at this stage."<ref>Hunter (2004), pp377-380</ref> Thorpe's increasing focus on the 100&nbsp;m event, coupled with the media pressure, resulted in speculation that he was vulnerable to Hackett in the 400&nbsp;m event.

In a topsy-turvy performance at irregular pace, Thorpe was passed by [[Klete Keller]] by the 150&nbsp;m mark before accelerating again to reclaim the lead by the 200&nbsp;m mark. Thorpe kept Hackett and Keller at around half a body-length up to the 300&nbsp;m mark, before breaking to a body-length lead by 350&nbsp;m. However, he could not produce his trademark finishing kick and was closed down by Hackett, holding on by only 0.26&nbsp; in a time three seconds outside his own world record.

Thorpe returned to competition at the New South Wales Championships in [[December 2005]] in the 200&nbsp;m, stating his intention to retire after the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]].<ref>{{cite news |title = Thorpe Not Planning Beyond 2008 |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/10697.asp | publisher = [[Swimming World magazine]] |date = [[2006-01-27]] |accessdate = 2006-11-14 |language = }}</ref> He also announced that with a view to concentrating on the 100&nbsp;m freestyle, he had dropped his pet event, the 400&nbsp;m freestyle, despite the urging of national coach [[Alan Thompson (swimming coach)|Alan Thompson]] to swim the event.<ref>{{cite news |first = |last = |title = Aussie Expectations Are High for Commonwealth Games |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/10507.asp |format =  |publisher = [[Swimming World magazine]] |date = [[2006-01-02]] |accessdate = 2006-11-14 |language = }}</ref> Thorpe began his qualification campaign for the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] in February [[2006 in sports|2006]] by winning the final of the 200&nbsp;m freestyle in a time of 1&nbsp;min 46.42s, expressing disappointment at a time slower than his performances at the State Championships.<ref>{{cite news |first = Stephen J.|last = Thomas|title = Australian Commonwealth Games Trials: Day Two Finals: Flash!

However he reasserted that he was enjoying his return and was anticipating further improvement at the Commonwealth Games.<ref>{{cite news |first = Stephen J.|last = Thomas|title = Australian Commonwealth Games Trials: Day Four Finals: Schipper Breaks Commonwealth Record to Win 100 Fly; Thorpe Gets the Job Done in 100 Freestyle to Take Fifth Title |url = http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/10771.asp |publisher = [[Swimming World magazine]] |date = [[2006-02-02]] |accessdate = 2006-11-14 |language = }}</ref> 
This was ambition was derailed on March 7, when Thorpe announced that he had withdrawn from the 2006 Commonwealth Games due to [[bronchitis]]. The illness had prevented him from training and Thorpe asserted that he would not even be of benefit in the team events.<ref>{{cite news | title = Thorpe is Out of Commonwealth Games|url= http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/10981.asp|publisher = [[Swimming World magazine]] |date =[[2006-03-07]] |accessdate = 2006-11-14 |language = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,18377317-2,00.html|title=Illness forces Thorpe to stand down|author=By staff writers and wires|accessdate=2006-03-07}}</ref> The illness that floored Thorpe was later diagnosed as a strain of [[glandular fever]],<ref>{{cite news |first =Jim|last = Wilson|title = Ian Thorpe turns to gymnastics|url= http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20532859-14641,00.html| publisher = [[Herald Sun]] |date = [[2006-10-06]] |accessdate = 2006-11-14 |language = }}</ref> and after a further delay due to a broken hand, he moved to [[Los Angeles]] in [[July]] to work with American coach [[Dave Salo]].

== Retirement ==
After withdrawing from the Australian Swimming Championships in Brisbane: the selection trials for the [[2007 World Aquatics Championships]], speculation mounted that Thorpe had lost motivation and would retire. On [[November 21]], 2006, at the age of 24, Thorpe held a press conference in [[Sydney]] to announce his retirement from competitive swimming where he briefly discussed his future directions.<ref>{{cite news | title=Ian Thorpe quits swimming | date=[[2006-11-21]] |accessdate = 2006-11-21 | publisher=news.com.au | url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,20795172-2,00.html}}</ref> [[Shane Gould]] noted that although his physical state was good, his mental state was empty, resulting in his decision to move on. Thorpe said that although he had been contemplating retirement for some time, he was afraid of the future as swimming had given him a "safety blanket". Thorpe noted that "As I got fit, physically fit, my mind also got fit," which he said had allowed him to reach his decision. He was close to tears when thanking the Australian public for its support, but declared that his retirement was a "joyous" occasion that the public could join to celebrate his career.<ref>{{cite news | first=Nicole|last=Jeffery|title=Thorpe looks up from black line | date=[[2006-11-22]] |accessdate = 2006-11-22 |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20799039-2722,00.html|publisher =[[The Australian]]}}</ref>

Following his retirement, head coach of the US men's swimming team [[Bob Bowman]], who also coaches [[Michael Phelps]], stated that Thorpe was "the greatest middle-distance swimmer of all time and he's the greatest relay swimmer I have seen." He also further cited Thorpe's ability to raise the profile of the sport and popularise it, noting that Phelps' public image was itself modelled on Thorpe's. [[Australian Olympic Committee]] president [[John Coates]] stated that "In 50 years from now Australians will still marvel at the feats of Ian Thorpe," paying tribute to his work for the Olympic movement. This was reinforced by [[Dawn Fraser]], the first person to win an Olympic event three times, who said that Thorpe was the "greatest swimmer in the world as far as freestyle swimming is concerned", but lamented that he would not attempting a hat-trick of 400&nbsp;m titles. His coach [[Tracey Menzies]] said that he "made the impossible things possible" whilst mentor Milt Nelms asserted that Thorpe was still capable of making a comeback for Beijing.<ref>{{cite news | first=Nicole|last=Jeffery|title=World bids adieu to pool pioneer | date=[[2006-11-22]] |accessdate = 2006-11-22 |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20799152-2722,00.html|publisher =[[The Australian]]}}</ref>

Thorpe's success has been attributed to a work ethic, mental strength, powerful kick, ability to accelerate and having a physiology suited to swimming. This led former [[Australia]]n head coach [[Don Talbot]] to label him as "the greatest swimmer the world has seen". Although ''Swimming World'' labelled his technique as "extraordinary" and "superior",<ref name="swiminfo tech"/> Talbot disagreed, stating his belief that Thorpe has placed too much of the workload on his kick at the expense of his arms. Talbot also cited Thorpe's ability to manage his workload and his day-to-day recovery between races during a meet, which he believed was deficient.<ref>Talbot (2003), pp1221-229</ref> He was known for his trademark six-beat kick to power away to victory in the closing stages of races, attributed to his unusually large size 17 feet.<ref name = "ABC profile"/>

==Personal life==
Thorpe is one of the most prominent and popular sportsmen in Australia. Despite competing in a sport where the vast majority of international athletes live below the [[poverty line]], marketing surveys have consistently shown Thorpe to be the most sought after Australian athlete for sponsorship deals, surpassing footballers who compete on a weekly basis in much larger stadia.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp vii-viii</ref> Aside from his swimsuit sponsor [[Adidas]], Thorpe is sponsored by Australian corporate giants such as [[Qantas]], [[Telstra]] and the [[Seven Network]].<ref name ="magnetic">{{cite news |first = Chloe|last = Saltau|title = The magnetic Mr Thorpe |url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/07/27/1059244481899.html|publisher = [[The Age]] |date = [[2003-07-28]] |accessdate = 2006-11-16 |language = }}</ref><ref>Hunter (2004), pp90, 140, 168</ref> In spite of his popularity as an athlete, his demeanour is often described as being quiet and mild-mannered. Known for his long-standing interest in fashion, he serves as an ambassador for [[Armani]],<ref name ="dyk"/> and has his own line of designer jewellery and underwear. Such interests have often led to speculation that Thorpe might be [[homosexuality|homosexual]], with his picture having been featured prominently on gay websites.<ref name ="magnetic"/> It was only in [[2002]] that he finally denied this rumour. In an interview with [[Monica Attard]] on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC national radio]], he asserted that he was [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]], though he said that he was flattered by these rumours, because he felt that being part of a minority group showed "strength in your character".<ref name="ABC profile"/><ref>{{cite news |first = Jacquelin|last = Magnay|title = Thorpe straight as the line on the bottom of the pool |url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/17/1037490052340.html |publisher = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date = [[2002-11-18]] |accessdate = 2006-11-10 |language = }}</ref><ref>Hunter (2004), pp318-320</ref>

Thorpe's interests in fashion and culture resulted in him making frequent visits to [[New York City]] (which he describes as a second home), often for obligations with Armani. He narrowly escaped death there on [[September 11]], [[2001]], having stopped at the [[World Trade Center]] on his morning jog before returning to his hotel.<ref name ="dyk"/> It was during this September trip that he was invited to be interviewed on the ''[[Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', which was notable due to the relative lack of interest in competitive swimming in America when compared to other major sports.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp280-281</ref> He later became a spokesperson for the unsuccessful [[New York City 2012 Olympic bid|New York city bid]] for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], even promising to defer his retirement to compete in them at the age of 29, if New York were to be successful.<ref>{{cite news |first = Jacquelin|last = Magnay|title = Ian Thorpe 'to rescue NY Olympic dream' |url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/sport/ian-thorpe-to-rescue-ny-olympic-dream/2005/07/04/1120329384268.html |format =  |publisher = [[The Age]] |date = 2005-07-05 |accessdate = 2006-11-10 |language = }}</ref> Thorpe's interests have also seen him involved in television, starring in a reality television show in [[2002]] called ''[[Undercover Angels]]'', which imitated the [[Charlie's Angels]] series. The show involved Thorpe directing three young women who performed good deeds for people in need. Although it was popular with the public and attracted more than a million viewers, it was widely panned by critics.<ref name ="magnetic"><ref>Hunter (2004), p294-295</ref> He also appeared as an extra in the American sitcom ''[[Friends]]''.<ref name ="dyk"/><ref>Hunter (2004), p244</ref>

Thorpe is widely popular in [[Asia]], and [[Japan]] in particular. He was identified in [[2000]] by [[TV Asahi]] as the swimmer likely to be the most successful at the forthcoming 2001 Fukuoka World Championships, and was selected as the marketing figurehead for the event. In a visit before the Championships to promote Asahi in a series of television events, he found his picture featured prominently on giant billboards.<ref name="gsiprofile"/><ref>Hunter (2004), pp236, 249, 257-260</ref> When he returned for the competition itself, he was mobbed at the airport by youthful crowds 25&nbsp;m deep, with hundreds camping outside the Australian team hotel. Aside from the younger generations, he was also praised by the older sections of the Japanese public as a role model for youth, due to what they interpreted as his humility and work ethic. He further endeared himself to them by doing interviews in [[Japanese language|Japanese]].<ref name ="magnetic"><ref>Hunter (2004), pp264-265, 275-276</ref> In [[2002]], in the wake of the tourism slump after the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]], he agreed to be a tourism ambassador for the [[Australian Tourism Commission]] in Japan. The high-profile campaigning involved frequent television advertising and a meeting with then [[Prime Minister of Japan|Japanese Prime Minister]] [[Junichiro Koizumi]], resulting in an upturn in Japanese tourism to Australia which was credited to Thorpe.<ref>Hunter (2004), pp292-293</ref><ref>{{cite news |first = Paul|last = McIntyre|title = Seafood campaign tests Thorpe's pulling power |url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/07/1089000223836.html?from=storylhs |format =  |publisher = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date = [[2004-07-08]] |accessdate = 2006-11-16 |language = }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last= Hockey | first= Joe| authorlink= Joe Hockey |title=Ian Thorpe - Australia's First Holiday Ambassador in Japan |url = http://minister.industry.gov.au/index.cfm?event=object.showContent&objectID=EDC62CAE-FB97-40EE-B7B30CFAA2CC7A91 |format =  |publisher = [[Government of Australia]] |date = [[2002-02-25]] |accessdate = 2006-11-22 | language=}}</ref> In 2005 the [[Yakult]] company in Japan released a 'Thorpedo' energy drink, featuring a picture of Thorpe on the bottle.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yakult to sell Ian Thorpe sports drink |url = http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/358607 |format =  |publisher = [[Japan Today]]|date=[[2005]] |accessdate = 2006-03-22 |language=}}</ref> This was part of an equity deal with the [[So Natural]] food group in which Thorpe was offered a 5% stake in the company, initially worth A$1.1m in return for the use of his name and image on their products. The 15-year deal covers markets across East and Southeast Asia and could expand Thorpe's share in the venture to 50% depending on its commercial success.<ref>{{cite news |first = Paul|last = McIntyre|title = Seafood campaign tests Thorpe's pulling power |url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/07/1089000223836.html?from=storylhs |format =  |publisher = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date = [[2004-07-08]] |accessdate = 2006-11-16 |language = }}</ref><ref>Hunter (2004), pp350-351</ref>

More recently, Thorpe has also emerged as a [[philanthropy|philanthropist]], founding the Ian Thorpe Fountain for Youth trust in [[2000]].<ref>Hunter (2004), p248</ref> The organization raises funds for research on childhood illnesses and also sponsors a school in [[Beijing]] for orphaned children with disabilities. In addition, it works with [[The Fred Hollows Foundation]] to improve health standards and living conditions in [[Indigenous Australians|Australian aboriginal]] communities.<ref name="gsiprofile"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.hollows.org/content/TextOnly.aspx?s=168|title= Jeff McMullen|accessdate=2006-11-16 |work= The Fred Hollows Foundation}}</ref><ref>Hunter (2004), pp331-333</ref> In addition to philanthropy, Thorpe also has an interest in raising awareness in wider social issues. Thorpe is prominent in the campaign against drug use, inside and outside sports. He has called for the introduction of blood testing<ref name="Talbot blood"/> and repeatedly criticised [[FINA]] for allegedly inadequate drug-testing procedures, claiming that "for anyone to think that they're swimming at a clean Olympic Games, they'd be naive". Although swimmers and coaches praised him, he was condemned by FINA, who accused him of bringing the sport into disrepute.<ref name="ABC profile"/><ref>{{cite news |first = |last = |title = Hall backs Thorpe over drug use claims |url = http://www.abc.net.au/sport/content/200408/s1168739.htm |format =  |publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date = [[2004-08-04]] |accessdate = 2006-11-10 |language = }}</ref><ref>Hunter (2004), pp379</ref> He was also selected by the [[United Nations]] to lead an anti-recreational drugs campaign in [[Japan]],<ref>Hunter (2004), p250</ref> as well as promotional work for [[UNICEF]] for UN Children's Week.<ref>Hunter (2004), p279</ref>
