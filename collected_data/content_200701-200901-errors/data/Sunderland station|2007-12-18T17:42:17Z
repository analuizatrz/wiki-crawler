'''Sunderland station''' is a [[National Rail]] and [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] station in [[Sunderland]], north-east [[England]]. It is the only station in the country where both [[heavy rail]] and [[light rail]] services use the same platforms. Although the tracks are shared between Sunderland and Pelaw Metro Junction (a short distance south of [[Pelaw Metro station]]), [[Northern Rail]] trains do not call at any of the intermediate stations.

==History of the current station==
The following information has been obtained from a 15 page booklet entitled "The new Sunderland Station - Official opening Thursday 4th November 1965." The booklet was published by British Railways, North Eastern Region in October 1965, printed by Herald Printers, York. Reference R23588.:-

The current Sunderland Station buildings were officially opened on Thursday 4th November 1965 by T. H. Summerson, Esq., J.P., D.L., who was then the President of the Summerson Group of Companies and the former Chairman of the North Eastern Railway Board.

At around that time progress was being made in the modernisation of railway passenger stations in the North Eastern Region of British Railways and it involved a number of extensive rebuilding schemes. Advantage was being taken of the larger stations, which occupied sites in the centre of towns which they served, which included Sunderland, Leeds City and Harrogate stations, of their property development potential.

At Sunderland, with station platforms and lines below street level, property development on the area above, included (as in 1965) a four-storey department store to be built over the North End of the station and a two-storey block of twenty shops, which were complete at that time, over the centre of the station. The area over the South End was occupied by new station buildings, which
was the first to three to be formally opened on the above date.

===Earlier stations===
The first railway passenger services to Sunderland were provided by the Durham & Sunderland Railway Company in 1836. The line approached from the south along the coast and the terminus was near South Dock, which was known as Town Moor station.

Undistinguished either in architecture, convenience or accommodation it was replaced 22 years later by Hendon station, half a mile to the south, at a point where the line had to be joined by the Newcastle & Darlington Junction Railway Company's line to Penshaw and Durham.

Meanwhile the Newcastle & Darlington Company had built their station at Fawcett Street, just south of the site of the present station.

In 1879, the North Eastern Railway Company opened a line from Ryhope Grange Junction, over the river to Monkwearmouth, and a new station was built on the present site. It opened on August Bank Holiday Monday of that year and both of the other stations at Hendon and Fawcett Street were closed.

The current station, officially known as - Sunderland Central - at that time, was known locally as the New station. Its platforms and lines lie in a cutting running north and south bounded by retaining walls to the east and west. Its single entrance and street-level buildings were at the North End, but a second entrance and associated buildings at the south were added five years later. The platform area was covered by an over-all semi-elliptical arched-rib roof which together with the North End buildings, was badly damaged by bombs in 1943.

In 1953, the old roof was replaced by umbrella-type roofing and the South End buildings were given an interim 'face-lift', the complete rebuilding being deferred to enable advantage to be taken of the site's potential for property development and to ensure compatibility with the town's proposals for the redevelopment of this central area. 

The complete rebuilding of the station was accomplished by November 1965.

===Buildings===
The current station buildings, which opened after re-building work in November 1965, formed at that time part of a complete rebuilding scheme which involved almost the entire area of the station site which was decked over and developed at street level.

The buildings covered the south end of the station area and a two-storey block of 20 shops, which were built by City and Central Shops Limited, occupies the central area. The old station buildings at the North End, which were retained in use until the new properties were being developed, were closed and demolished. In that area British Railways provided new premises for parcels traffic and Post Office Mails, which were redeveloped with the alterations to the platforms for Metro train services in 2002, and Littlewood's Mail Order Stores Limited (now occupied by [[T J Hughes]]), developed a four-storey department store with a main frontage on to High Street West.

As at November 1965, following the withdrawal of local stopping train services on the lines to West Hartlepool, Durham and South Shields, passenger trains were concentrated on one island platform with access to the concourse area by a dual 'one-direction' stairway. The second island platform was given over to the working of parcels traffic as a new parcels office premises was to be built at the North End and brought into use. Prior to this the parcels traffic was being dealt with at Monkwearmouth.

Also at that time, the revised station working enabled the running lines and sidings at the South End of the station to be simplified. The consequent reduction in permanent way (i.e. railway track) released areas of land at track level which was available for the erection of support for further street level development between Athenaeum Street and Holmside bridges and also on the south side of Holmeside.

At the time that the modernised buildings opened from [[4 November]] [[1965]], train services from Sunderland included a half hourly service each weekday to and from Newcastle, and an hourly service to and from West Hartlepool and Middlesbrough, with additional trains at peak periods. There were also then through morning trains to London and to Liverpool, and a sleeping car service to London every night of the week. Good connections were available from Newcastle with all parts of the country.

==Layout==
Since 2002 when the station was remodelled to accommodate Metro services the layout has been unique in the Great Britain. The station has a large central island platform with each side split into two numbered platforms. Northern Rail services call at platforms 1 and 4 at the northern end, while platforms 2 and 3 at the southern end are for Metro services.

==Metro services==

Metro services run at a peak of eight per hour calling at all stations. 
To the south, services run to [[South Hylton Metro station|South Hylton]] along the alignment of the Sunderland to [[Durham]] mainline that fell to the [[Beeching Axe]] in the 1960s. The first station is [[Park Lane Interchange|Park Lane]], which provides a direct interchange with the bus and coach station. 

Northbound the first station is [[St Peter's Metro station|St Peter's]] which is a couple of hundred yards south of the long closed [[Monkwearmouth]] station that is now a [[Monkwearmouth Station Museum|museum]]. 

The track is shared with mainline trains as far as Pelaw Metro Junction, just south of [[Pelaw Metro station]]. The former mainline stations at [[Brockley Whins Metro station|Brockley Whins]], [[East Boldon Metro station|East Boldon]], [[Seaburn Metro station|Seaburn]] are now served only by the Metro. In addition new stations at [[Fellgate Metro station|Fellgate]], the [[Stadium of Light]], and St Peter's were constructed.

On [[12 December]] [[2005]] the Yellow and Green Lines of the Metro swaped routes between Pelaw and [[South Shields]] / Sunderland and South Hylton, meaning that there is a direct rail link between Sunderland and [[Newcastle Airport]] for the first time.

==Mainline services==
The current regional operator [[Northern Rail]] provides an off-peak service of one train per hour between Sunderland and Newcastle in both directions, with many trains also running to the [[MetroCentre]] shopping centre, [[Hexham]], [[Carlisle]] and [[Middlesbrough]].

The service to [[Newcastle Central Station]] is now considered an express service, calling only at [[Heworth railway station|Heworth]], which is also served by the Metro, but the lines are segregated at this point. The former stopping service (which called at [[Seaburn]], [[East Boldon Metro station|East Boldon]] and [[Brockley Whins Metro station|Brockley Whins]]) is now provided only by the Metro.

In January 2006 new operator [[Grand Central Railway|Grand Central]] was granted permission to run four trains per day from Sunderland to [[King's Cross railway station|London Kings Cross]] via [[Eaglescliffe railway station|Eaglescliffe (for Middlesbrough)]], [[Northallerton railway station|Northallerton]], [[Thirsk railway station|Thirsk]] and [[York railway station|York]]. Grand Central began running services on 18th December 2007.

==Future developments==
It is possible that the [[Leamside line]] may be re-opened. This starts at the Pelaw Junction on the Sunderland to Newcastle line and runs through to the Tursdale junction just north of  [[Ferryhill]], [[County Durham]]. The Select Committee on Transport, Local Government and the Regions has expressed concern at the delays in determing the future of this line [http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmtlgr/603/603ap07.htm]

==Electrification==
The Tyne and Wear Metro uses overhead electrification at 1500 volts DC. This is incompatible with UK mainline electrification, which uses 25,000 volts AC. Additionally the reconstruction of the station to allow the Metro services to call here now means that [[British Rail Mark 4|Mark IV coaches]], now cannot call at the station, even if diesel hauled, as they are [[break-of-gauge|out-of-gauge]] {{Fact|date=February 2007}}.
