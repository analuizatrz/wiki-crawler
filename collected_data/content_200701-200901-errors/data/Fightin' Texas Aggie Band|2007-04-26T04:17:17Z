==Joseph Holick and the beginnings of the band==
[[Image:Aggie Band.jpg|right|thumb|"ATM" formation during halftime at [[Kyle Field]]]]
Joseph Holick, age 22, and his brother Louis, rode in an empty boxcar to Orange, Texas, so that they could get lumber mill employment. However, the two stopped off in Bryan, Texas, and young Joseph began to doubt his choice. "I was a small boy and couldn't do lumbering work" said Joseph once, and so he stayed back and worked under Raymond Blatherwick, owner of a prominent boot shop. According to the Holick family, Lawrence Sullivan Ross, the first successful president of TAMC, stopped into Blatherwick's boot shop and noted how inconvenient it was for cadets to go to Bryan for their boots. Holick was requested to be stationed at the college, and there he went to do work for the young university. <ref name="Powell">The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band (Centennial Series of the Association of Former Students, Texas A & M University) by Donald B. Powell and Mary Jo Powell, http://www.amazon.com/Fightin-Centennial-Association-Students-University/dp/0890965951/ref=sr_1_1/103-5649495-4846222?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1175011672&sr=8-1</ref><ref name="holicks page">http://holicks.com/contact.html</ref>

Shortly after he moved to work at A&M, the staff discovered his musical talents, and requested him to play the bugle. For $65 a month, he was assigned to play "Reveille" and "Taps." Thinking that this was an impressive amount compared to his previous work, Holick wanted "to get more than just two tunes for its money, and when he had established himself as the bugler, he asked the commandant for permission to start a cadet band." When the commandant agreed, they went about finding the proper resources to start up the band, and Joseph Holick was named its first bandmaster.<ref name="Powell" /><ref name="holicks page" />

*Some of the Aggie Band drills, including the "Four-Way Crossthrough" require band members to actually step between each other's feet in order to complete the maneuver.<ref name="aggieband.org">http://www.aggieband.org/visitors-about.php</ref> When these drills were run through the drill program on a computer, an error was returned stating that the drill was impossible because it required two people to be in the same spot at the same time.<ref>http://b-batt.tamu.edu/dwnld/040918-jumbo-clem.wmv</ref> For this reason, these drills were written by hand until 2000 when new software was installed and an override feature was added.
