{{Korean name|Ban}}
'''Ban Ki-moon''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA pronunciation]]: {{IPA|[pan.gi.mun<!-- Please, don't edit [ban.gi.mun]. Hangul's 'ㅂ' is pronounced [p] (not [pʰ], like 'picture' in English), except that it is put between voiced sounds. -->]}}) (born [[June 13]] [[1944]] in [[Eumseong]], [[North Chungcheong]],<!--South Korea did not exist as a state in 1944 --> [[Korea]]) is a former [[South Korea]]n [[diplomat]] who succeeded [[Kofi Annan]] as the [[United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General]] of the [[United Nations]] on [[January 1]] [[2007]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061013/ap_on_re_as/un_secretary_general|title=Ban named next U.N. secretary-general|publisher=''[[Associated Press|AP]]''|accessdate=2006-10-13}}</ref>

Ban was the [[Foreign Minister]] of [[South Korea|the Republic of Korea]] from January 2004 to [[November 1]] [[2006]]. On [[October 13]] [[2006]], he was elected to be the eighth Secretary-General by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and was sworn in on [[December 14]] [[2006]].  He had previously addressed the General Assembly in his capacity as foreign minister during its annual general debate each year since 2004.

==Education==
Ban received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[international relations|International Relations]] from [[Seoul National University]] in 1970 and earned a [[Master of Public Administration|Master in Public Administration]] from the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] in 1985.

==Personal==
Ban Ki-moon is married and has a son and two daughters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mofat.go.kr/me/me_a001/me_b002/me_c007/me01_02_sub01.jsp|title=Biography of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade|publisher=''[[South Korea|Republic of Korea]]'' - Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade|accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref> In addition to his native [[Korean language|Korean]], Ban speaks [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[German language|German]], according to his [[curriculum vitae]]. However, there have been questions on the extent of his knowledge of [[French language|French]], a language that veto-wielding [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] member [[France]] insists any United Nations Secretary General must be able to speak. This has resulted in some controversy. (See [[#Criticism|Criticism]])

An exchange student during the 60's at High School in Marin County, California, Ban met then [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] after winning an English language competition organized by the [[American Red Cross]]. He has said that it was after this meeting that he resolved to become a diplomat.

==Career==
[[Image:Ban Ki-moon and Condoleezza Rice.jpg|thumb|left|Ban Ki-moon with [[Condoleezza Rice]].]]
Ban joined the [[Foreign relations of South Korea|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] in May 1970, and worked his way up during the years of the [[Yusin Constitution]].

His first overseas posting was to [[New Delhi]], after which he worked in the United Nations Division at the foreign ministry's headquarters. At the time of [[Park Chung Hee]]'s assassination, Ban had climbed to the position of First Secretary at South Korea's Permanent Observer Mission to the UN  in [[New York City]] (South Korea only became a full UN member state on [[September 17]] [[1991]]). He subsequently assumed the post of Director of the United Nations Division. He has been posted twice to the [[Republic of Korea]] ([[ROK]]) [[embassy]] in Washington, D.C. Between these two assignments he served as Director-General for American Affairs in 1990&ndash;1992. He was promoted to the position of Deputy Minister for Policy Planning and International Organizations in 1995. He was then appointed [[National Security Advisor (South Korea)|National Security Advisor]] to the President in 1996, and assumed the office of Vice Minister in 2000. His most recent post was as Foreign Policy Advisor to the President, [[Roh Moo-hyun]].

While serving as [[Ambassador]] to [[Austria]], Ban was elected as Chairman of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization ([[CTBTO]] PrepCom) in 1999. During the ROK's Presidency of the 56th Session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] (GA) in 2001, he worked as Chef de Cabinet of the President of the GA. 

Ban has been actively involved in issues relating to inter-Korean relationships. In 1992, he served as Vice Chairman of the South-North Joint Nuclear Control Commission, following the adoption by South and [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea)|North Korea]] of the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the [[Korean Peninsula]]. In September 2005, as [[Foreign Minister]], he played a leading role in the diplomatic efforts to adopt the Joint Statement on resolving the North Korean nuclear issue at the Fourth Round of the [[Six-Party Talks]] held in [[Beijing]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Secretary-General of the United Nations==

In February 2006, Ban declared his candidacy to replace [[Kofi Annan]] as UN Secretary-General at the end of 2006, becoming the first South Korean to run for Secretary-General.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/nation/200602/kt2006021416334111990.htm|title=Minister Ban to Run for Top UN Job|author=Song-wu, Park|publisher=[[The Korea Times]]|accessdate=2006-09-28|date=[[2006-02-14]]}}</ref> He topped each of the four [[straw poll]]s conducted by the [[UN Security Council]] on [[July 24]],<ref>{{cite  web|url=http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/115|title=Ban takes 1st Straw Poll|publisher=[http://www.unsg.org UNSG.org]|date=[[2006-07-24]]|accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref> [[14 September]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/138|title=Ban firms up lead in second Straw Poll|publisher=[http://www.unsg.org UNSG.org]|date=[[2006-09-14]]|accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref> [[September 28]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/164|title=Ban slips but holds, Vike Freiberga pushes into third|publisher=[http://www.unsg.org UNSG.org]|date=[[2006-09-28]]|accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref> and [[October 2]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/170|title=Ban Ki-moon wins|publisher=[http://www.unsg.org UNSG.org]|date=[[2006-10-02]]|accessdate=2006-10-02}}</ref> 

<!-- [[Image:BUSHBANKI.jpg|thumb|300px|left|President [[George W. Bush]] talks with [[United Nations Secretary-General]] Designate Ban Ki-moon of the [[Republic of Korea]].]] -->
On [[September 25]], [[2006]], while these polls were being conducted, Ban addressed the [[Asia Society]] in New York on his candidacy and views on major issues confronting the UN.<ref>http://www.asiasociety.org/speeches/06ny_ban.html</ref> The next day he gave an interview to the Asia Society's ''AsiaSource'', focusing again on the upcoming challenges to be faced by the UN. Earlier in the year he had addressed the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] in New York.<ref>http://www.asiasource.org/news/special_reports/kimoon.cfm</ref>

Subsequently, in an [[October 2]] informal poll, Ban received fourteen favorable votes and one "no opinion" from the fifteen members of the Security Council.  More importantly, Ban was the only one to escape a veto, while each of the five other candidates received at least one "no" vote from the five permanent members of the council —  People's Republic of China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1104AP_UN_Next_Chief.html|title=Ban vows to reform U.N. if given top job|publisher=[http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/]|date=[[2006-10-03]]|accessdate=2006-10-09}}</ref>  After the vote, [[Shashi Tharoor]], who finished second, withdrew his candidacy<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/morenews/showmorestory.asp?id=94211|title=Shashi Tharoor pulls out of UN race|publisher=[http://www.ndtv.com/ NDTV.com]|date=[[2006-10-02]]|accessdate=2006-10-02}}</ref> and [[China|China's]] Permanent Representative to the UN told reporters that "it is quite clear from today's straw poll that Minister Ban Ki-moon is the candidate that the Security Council will recommend to the General Assembly."<ref>http://webcast.un.org/ramgen/sc/so061002pm3.rm</ref> 

{{wikinews|General Assembly elects Ban Ki-moon as next UN chief}}
On [[October 9]], the Security Council formally chose Ban as its nominee. On [[October 13]], the 192-member [[UNGA|General Assembly]] adopted a resolution, by [[acclamation]], appointing Ban as Secretary-General. On [[January 1]], [[2007]] Ban took office as the eighth Secretary-General of the United Nations.

On Thursday, March 22, 2007, while taking part in a press conference in Baghdad's green zone, a mortar attack hit close to where the secretary general was standing, interrupting the conference and visibly shaking Ban and others.  He was unharmed by the incident.

==Awards==
Ban has twice been awarded the Order of Service Merit in 1975 and 1986 by the Government of the [[Republic of Korea]].  For his accomplishments as an envoy, he received the Grand Decoration of Honour from the [[Republic of Austria]] in 2001.  A year later, the government of [[Brazil]] bestowed the Grand Cross of Rio Branco upon him.  

In September 2005, the [[Korea Society]] in [[New York]] honoured him with the [[James A. Van Fleet Award]] for his contributions to friendship between the United States and the Republic of Korea.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/news/news_detail.htm?No=39557|title=Samsung Chairman Lee Receives Van Fleet Award|date=[[2006-09-20]]|accessdate=2006-09-28|publisher=[http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/ KBS World]}}</ref>

==Criticism==

Ban claims to be fluent in both [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] which have long been considered the de facto operating languages of the UN. However, he has struggled to answer questions in French from journalists since being sworn in as UN Secretary General.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/reportsfromabroad/herland/20061214.html|title=Is Ban Ki-moon a franco-phoney?|publisher=CBC News}}</ref>

As the election of the successor to the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan drew closer there was rising criticism of the South Korean campaign on Ban's behalf. Specifically, his alleged practice of systematically visiting all member states of the UN Security Council in his role as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade to secure votes in his support by signing trade deals with European countries and pledging [[foreign aid]] to [[developing countries]] were the focus of some news articles.<ref>http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25689-2380336,00.html</ref><ref>[http://online.wsj.com/google_login.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB115984169920380825.html%3Fmod%3Dgooglenews_wsj online.wsj.com]</ref>

According to the ''[[Washington Post]],'' "rivals have privately grumbled that Republic of Korea, which has the world's 11th-largest economy, has wielded its economic might to generate support for his candidacy". Ban reportedly has said that these insinuations are "groundless". In an interview on [[17 September]] [[2006]] he reportedly stated: "As front-runner, I know that I can become a target of this very scrutinizing process" and "I am a man of integrity."<ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/28/AR2006092801765.html</ref>

Although not directly a criticism of Ban Ki-moon, there has also been concern{{Fact|Who expressed this 'concern'?|date=February 2007}} over the appointment of Kang Kyung-wha, Ban's [[campaign manager]], as [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights]], an assistant secretary-general-level position, with only weeks left in Kofi Annan's term.<ref>http://www.nysun.com/article/40249</ref>

Within Korea, Ban’s nickname is "Ban-jusa", which may be loosely translated as “Ban the administrative clerk." 
This appellation is used by Ban’s supporters and opponents alike, but the latter intend to hint at a “lack of charisma and a supposed willingness to bend to the will of his superiors,” as well as his personality, which they perceive to be uninspiring.<ref name="economist-E1_RDDDJGQ">{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_RDDDJGQ
|title=The UN’s new secretary-general
|accessdate=2006-10-05
|publisher=The Economist
}}</ref>
Perhaps an attempt at a comeback to claims of a lack of charisma would explain his singing of a version of ''[[Santa Claus Is Coming to Town]]'', where he replaced the words 'Santa Claus' with his own name at the 2006 UN Correspondents dinner early in December.<ref name="newsArticle.aspx?type=worldNews&storyID=2006-12-14T223240Z_01_NOOTR_RTRJONC_0_India-280289-2.xml">{{cite web |url=http://in.today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldNews&storyID=2006-12-14T223240Z_01_NOOTR_RTRJONC_0_India-280289-2.xml
|title=Ban Ki-moon Is Coming To Town
|accessdate=2006-12-16

Ban has been criticized for not sufficiently condemning the [[death penalty]], specifically in the case of [[Barzan al-Tikriti]] and [[Awad al-Bandar]], two top officials who were convicted, along with [[Saddam Hussein]], of the deaths of 148 Shia Muslims in the Iraqi village of [[Dujail]] in the [[1980s]]. Though Ban did write a letter of appeal to Iraqi High Tribunal urging restraint in this case, he stated that capital punishment "was for each and every ([[United Nation]]) member state to decide." Ban has also been praised for respecting the UN's limited jurisdiction on the matter, as the UN Charter makes no mention of any position on the death penalty.

==Religious views==

Despite some initial rumors that he was a member of the [[Unification Church]], and later reports that stated he is a member of a "group without Church",<ref>http://www.asianews.it/view.php?l=en&art=7415</ref> ''[[The Economist]]'' confirmed in [[January 2007]] that he is not a member of any church or religious group.<ref>http://www.economist.com/world/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8525903</ref>
