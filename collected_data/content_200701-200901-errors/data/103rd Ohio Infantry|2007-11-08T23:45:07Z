The '''103rd Regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry''' was an [[infantry]] [[regiment]] from northern [[Ohio in the American Civil War|Ohio]] that served in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]].

On [[July 21]], [[1862]], [[William B. Castle]], as chairman of the District Military Committee, [[Cleveland, Ohio]], sent a letter to [[Governor of Ohio|Governor]] [[David Tod]], enclosing a copy of a resolution recommending that the appointment of company officers for the 103rd Regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry.[http://www.ohiohistory.org/onlinedoc/civilwar/sa0147/43_04.cfm] The unit was to draw members from  [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio]], [[Lorain County, Ohio]] and [[Medina County, Ohio]]. 

The 103rd Regiment Infantry was organized at [[Cleveland, Ohio]], in August 1862. It was ordered to Kentucky on [[September 3]], [[1862]], and attached to the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, [[Army of Kentucky]], [[Department of the Ohio]]. The regiment saw action in [[Kentucky]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]] and [[Tennessee]].

The 103rd mustered out on [[June 12]], [[1865]]. It lost during its term of service 2 officers and 137 enlisted men killed and mortally wounded, and 3 officers and 106 enlisted men by disease, for a total 148. 

In 1866, veterans formed the 103rd O.V.I. Association. They and/or their descendants have held a reunion every year since then, the only U.S. organization of its kind.
