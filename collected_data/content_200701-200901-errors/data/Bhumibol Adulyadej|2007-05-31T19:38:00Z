'''Bhumibol Adulyadej''' ({{lang-th|ภูมิพลอดุลยเดช}}; {{IPA2|pʰuːmipʰon adunjadeːt}}; [[Royal Thai General System of Transcription|Royal Institute]]: Phumiphon Adunyadet; {{Audio|Bhumibol Adulyadej.ogg|listen}}) (born [[December 5]], [[1927]]), is the current [[Chakri Dynasty|King of Thailand]]. Officially styled "the Great" (Thai: มหาราช, ''[[Maharaja]]''), he is also known as '''[[Rama (King of Thailand)|Rama IX]]''', His name, Bhumibol Adulyadej, means "Strength of the Land, Incomparable Power".<ref>{{cite book | author=Wimuttanon, Suvit (ed.) | title=Amazing Thailand (special collector's edition)|publisher=World Class Publishing | year=2001 | pages=Page 33 |id=ISBN 974-91020-3-7}}</ref> Having reigned since [[June 9]], [[1946]], he is the world's [[List of longest reigning current monarchs|longest-serving]] current [[head of state]] and the [[List of longest reigning monarchs of all time|longest-serving]] monarch in [[Thailand|Thai]] history.<ref name="longestthai">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1996 | url = http://www.worldhop.com/Journals/J5/ROYAL.HTM | title = A Royal Occasion speeches | format = | work = | publisher = Worldhop.com Journal | accessdate = 05 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

Although Bhumibol is a [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarch]], he has several times made decisive interventions in [[Politics of Thailand|Thai politics]], including the [[2005-2006 Thai political crisis]]. He was credited with facilitating Thailand's [[History of Thailand since 1973#Democracy|transition to democracy]] in the 1990s, although in earlier periods of his reign he supported military regimes.  Most recently, he endorsed the [[CDRM|military junta]] which overthrew the elected government of [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] during the [[2006 Thailand coup d'état|September 2006 coup]].  A [[billionaire]] and one of the wealthiest men in the world, Bhumibol used part of his great wealth to fund development projects, particularly in rural areas. He is immensely popular in Thailand, and is revered as a semi-divine figure by many Thais. Critics, mostly outside Thailand, attribute this status to the [[censorship in Thailand|suppression of criticism]] of the monarchy.<ref name="criticism">{{cite web | last = Macan-Markar | first = Marwaan | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006-05-24 | url = http://www.asiamediaforum.org/node/441 | title =

Bhumibol was born in the [[United States]] and educated primarily in [[Switzerland]]. Bhumibol is also an accomplished musician, artist, and sailor.

== Early life ==
Bhumibol was born in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], in the United States, the youngest son of [[Mahidol Adulyadej]], Prince of [[Songkhla]], and son of King [[Chulalongkorn]] and [[Thai royal and noble titles#Mom (wife)|Mom]] [[Srinagarindra|Sangwal]] (later Somdej Phra Sri Nakarindhara Boromaratchachonnani). At the time of his birth, he was known in Thailand as Phra Worawongse Ther Phra Ong Chao Bhumibol Adulyadej (พระวรวงศ์เธอ พระองค์เจ้าภูมิพลอดุลยเดช), reflecting the fact that his mother was a commoner.<ref name="commoner">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =  | url = http://www.holcimfoundation.org/media/publications/awards_global/Global06_Info_Thai-King_en.doc | title = King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand | format = DOC| work = | publisher = Holcim Foundation | accessdate = 2006-08-13}}</ref> Had he been born just a few years earlier, before his uncle [[Prajadhipok|King Prajadhipok]] passed a law allowing children of a prince and a commoner to be called [[Thai royal and noble titles#Phra Ong Chao|Phra Ong Chao]] (a prince of a lesser status than [[Thai royal and noble titles#Chao Fa|Chao Fa]]), he would have been called [[Thai royal and noble titles#Mom Chao|Mom Chao]] (the most junior class of the Thai princes), similar to his [[Ananda Mahidol|older brother]] and [[Galyani Vadhana|sister]].<ref name="chakridynastyranks">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =  | url = http://members.tripod.com/~tudtu/chakri.html | title = The Illustrious Chakri Family | format = | work = | publisher = Tudtu | accessdate = 2006-08-13}}</ref>

Bhumibol was brought back to Thailand in 1928, after [[Mahidol Adulyadej|Prince Mahidol]] obtained a certificate from Public Health Program at [[Harvard University]]. After primary schooling at the [[Mater Dei Institute|Mater Dei]] school in [[Bangkok]], he left with the rest of his family in 1933 for [[Switzerland]], where he continued his secondary education at the [[École Nouvelle de la Suisse Romande]] in [[Chailly-sur-Lausanne]], and received the ''[[baccalauréat]] des lettres'' (high-school diploma with major in [[French literature]], [[Latin]], and [[Greek]]) from the Gymnase Classique Cantonal of [[Lausanne]]. He was studying science at the [[University of Lausanne]] when his elder brother, Phra Ong Chao [[Ananda Mahidol]], was crowned King of Thailand in 1935. King [[Ananda Mahidol]] then elevated his brother and sister to [[Chao Fa]] status, the most senior class of the Thai princes and princesses. They came to Thailand briefly in 1938, but returned to Switzerland for further study, where they stayed until 1945.<ref name="kingjubnet">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1999 | url = http://www.kanchanapisek.or.th/biography/hmk.en.html | title = Biography of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej | format = | work = The Golden Jubilee Network | publisher = Kanchanapisek Network | accessdate = 2006-08-05}}</ref>

== Succession and marriage ==
Bhumibol ascended to the throne following the death of his brother, King [[Ananda Mahidol]], on [[June 9]], [[1946]]. Ananda Mahidol's death resulted from a gunshot to the head while in his bedroom in the Baromphiman Palace in the [[Grand Palace, Bangkok|Grand Palace]], under circumstances that to this day remain a mystery.<ref>{{cite web | last = Simpson | first = Keith | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1978 | url = http://www.khunnamob.info/board/note.php?ref=m1ebrtzP | title = Forty Years of Murder: an Autobiography | format = | work = Chapter 13: The Violent Death of King Ananda of Siam | publisher =  | accessdate = 23 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> Bhumibol then returned to Switzerland in order to complete his education, and his uncle, [[Rangsit, Prince of Chainat]], was appointed Prince Regent. Bhumibol switched over his field of study to law and [[political science]] in order to prepare himself more effectively for his new position as ruler.

While finishing his degree in Switzerland, Bhumibol visited [[Paris]] frequently. It was in Paris that he first met a [[first cousin once removed]], [[Thai royal and noble titles#Mom Rajawongse|Mom Rajawongse]] [[Sirikit]] Kitiyakara, daughter of the Thai ambassador to [[France]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Bhirom Bhakdi| first = Soravij| authorlink = | coauthors = | year =  | url = http://www.soravij.com/queens.html | title = Queens of the Chakri Dynasty| format = | work = | publisher =  | accessdate = 1 August | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> He was 21 and she was 15. Bhumibol became a regular visitor to the ambassador's residence.

On [[October 4]], [[1948]], while Bhumibol was driving a [[Fiat Topolino]] on the [[Geneva]]-[[Lausanne]] highway, he [[rear-end collision|collided into the rear]] of a braking truck 10 km outside of Lausanne. He hurt his back and incurred cuts on his face that [[enucleation|cost him sight in his right eye]].<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =  | url = http://srinai.tripod.com/guide/King.html | title = A Royal Romance | format = | work = | publisher =  Srinai Tripod.com| accessdate = 12 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = Dec 5, 2005 | url = http://www.bangkokpost.net/60yrsthrone/60yrsthrone/index.html | title = The Making of a Monarch | format = | work = | publisher = Bangkok Post | accessdate = 12 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref><ref>Handley, Paul M. (2006). [[The King Never Smiles]]. Yale University Press, Page 104. ISBN 0-300-10682-3.</ref>  He subsequently wore an [[ocular prosthetic]].  While he was hospitalized in Lausanne, Sirikit visited him frequently. She met his mother, who asked her to continue her studies nearby so that Bhumibol could get to know her better. Bhumibol selected for her a boarding school in Lausanne, [[Riante Rive]]. A quiet engagement in Lausanne followed on [[July 19]], [[1949]], and the couple were married on [[April 28]], [[1950]], just a week before his coronation.

Bhumibol and his wife Queen Sirikit have four children:

* (Formerly HRH) Princess [[Ubol Ratana]], born [[April 5]], [[1951]]&nbsp;in Lausanne, Switzerland;
* HRH Crown Prince [[Maha Vajiralongkorn]], born [[July 28]], [[1952]];
* HRH Princess [[Maha Chakri Sirindhorn]], born [[April 2]], [[1955]];
* HRH Princess [[Chulabhorn Walailak]], born [[July 4]], [[1957]].

One of Bhumibol's grandchildren, [[Bhumi Jensen]], was killed in the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. He was the son of Princess Ubol Ratana.

== Coronation and titles ==
{{Thai Royal Family|Thai Garuda emblem.png}}
Bhumibol was crowned King of Thailand on [[May 5]], [[1950]] at the Royal Palace in Bangkok where he pledged that he would "reign with righteousness for the benefit and happiness of the Siamese people" ("เราจะครองแผ่นดินโดยธรรม เพื่อประโยชน์สุขแห่งมหาชนชาวสยาม").<ref name="oath">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = 
http://www.2bangkok.com/news05t.shtml | title = Royal Power Controversy | format = | work = | publisher = 2Bangkok.com | accessdate = 2007-01-04}}</ref> His ceremonial name is:
:พระบาทสมเด็จพระปรมินทรมหาภูมิพลอดุลยเดช มหิตลาธิเบศรามาธิบดี จักรีนฤบดินทร์ สยามินทราธิราช บรมนาถบพิตร (Phrabat Somdej Phra Paramindra Maha Bhumibol Adulyadej Mahitaladhibet Ramadhibodi Chakrinarubodindara Sayamindaradhiraj Boromanatbophit {{Audio|Th-King Bhumibol's ceremonial name.ogg|listen}})

On the same day, he made his consort Queen ([[Thai royal and noble titles#Somdej Phra Boromarajini|Somdej Phra Boromarajini]]). The date of his coronation is celebrated each May 5 in Thailand as [[Coronation Day (Thailand)|Coronation Day]], a public holiday. On [[December 5]], [[1996]], Bhumibol celebrated his 50th anniversary as the King of Thailand, becoming the longest reigning monarch in Thai history.<ref name= "longestthai"/>

Following the death of his grandmother Queen [[Savang Vadhana]] (สว่างวัฒนา, Sawang Watthana Phra Phanvasa Aiyeekajao), Bhumibol entered a 15-day monkhood ([[October 22]]&ndash;[[November 5]], [[1956]]) at [[Wat Bowonniwet]], as is customary at the death of elder relatives. During this time, Sirikit was appointed his regent. She was later appointed Queen Regent ([[Thai royal and noble titles#Somdej Phra Boromarajininat|Somdej Phra Boromarajininat]]) in recognition of this.

Although Bhumibol is sometimes referred to as King Rama IX in English, the name "[[Rama (King of Thailand)|Rama]]" is never used in Thai. The name is used to approximate "'''Ratchakal ti Kao'''" (รัชกาลที่ 9, literally "the Ninth Reign"). More commonly, Thais refer to him as '''Nai Luang''' or '''Phra Chao Yu Hua''' (ในหลวง or พระเจ้าอยู่หัว: both mean "the King"). Formally, he would be referred to as '''Phrabat Somdej Phra Chao Yu Hua''' (พระบาทสมเด็จพระเจ้าอยู่หัว) or, in legal documents, '''Phrabat Somdej Phra Paraminthara Maha Bhumibol Adulyadej''' (พระบาทสมเด็จพระปรมินทรมหาภูมิพลอดุลยเดช), and in English as His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej. He signs his name as ภูมิพลอดุลยเดช ป.ร. (Bhumibol Adulyadej Por Ror; this is the Thai equivalent of Bhumibol Adulyadej R[ex]).

== Role in Thai politics ==
===Plaek Pibulsonggram era===
In the early years of his reign, during the government of military dictator [[Plaek Pibulsonggram]], Bhumibol had no real power and was little more than a ceremonial front for the military-dominated government.  In August 1957, 6 months after parliamentary elections, General [[Sarit Dhanarajata]] accused the government of Field Marshal [[Plaek Pibulsonggram|Pibulsonggram]] of [[lèse majesté]] due to its conduct of the 2,500th anniversary celebration of [[Buddhism]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Handley, Paul M. | title=The King Never Smiles |publisher=Yale University Press | year=2006 | pages=Page 129-130, 136-137 |id=ISBN 0-300-10682-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Thak Chaloemtiarana | title=Thailand: The Politics of Despotic Paternalism |publisher=Social Science Association of Thailand | year=1979 | pages=Page 98}}</ref>  On September 16, 1957, Pibulsonggram went to Bhumibol to seek support for his government.<ref>{{cite book | author=Suwannathat-Pian, Kobkua | title=Thailand's Durable Premier |publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1995 | pages=Page 30 |id=ISBN 967-65-3053-0}}</ref>  Bhumibol told the Field Marshal to resign to avoid a coup; Pibulsonggram refused.  That evening, Sarit Dhanarajata seized power, and two hours later Bhumibol decreed martial law, named Sarit as "defender of the capital", and allowed Sarit to countersign royal decrees.<ref>{{cite book | author=Handley, Paul M. | title=The King Never Smiles |publisher=Yale University Press | year=2006 | pages=Page 138 |id=ISBN 0-300-10682-3}}</ref> 

===Sarit Dhanarajata era===
[[Image:SaritandBhumibol2.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Bhumibol bestowing an [[honorary doctorate]] to [[Sarit Dhanarajata]], 1960, [[Kasetsart University]]]] 

During Sarit's dictatorship, the monarchy was revitalised.  Bhumibol attended public ceremonies, toured the provinces and patronised development projects. Under Sarit, the practice of crawling in front of royalty during audiences, banned by King [[Chulalongkorn]], was revived and the royal-sponsored [[Thammayut Nikaya]] order was revitalised. For the first time since the absolute monarchy was overthrown, a king was conveyed up the [[Chao Phraya River]] in a [[Thailand's Royal Barge Procession|Royal Barge Procession]] to offer robes at temples.<ref>{{cite web | last = Evans | first = Dr. Grant | authorlink = | coauthors = citing Christine Gray | year = 1998 | url = http://www.laosnet.org/fa-ngum/ewans.htm | title = The Politics of Ritual and Remembrance: Laos since 1975 | format = | work = | publisher = Laosnet.org | accessdate = 05 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Evans, Dr. Grant | title=The Politics of Ritual and Remembrance: Laos since 1975 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press | year=1998 | pages=Pages 89-113 |id=ISBN 0-8248-2054-1}}</ref> 

Other disused ceremonies from the classical period of the [[Chakri dynasty]], like the royally-patronised ploughing ceremony (Thai: พิธีพืชมงคล), were also revived.<ref>{{cite web | last = Klinkajorn | first = Karin | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =  | url = http://www.international.icomos.org/xian2005/papers/2-18.pdf | title = Creativity and Settings of Monuments and Sites in Thailand: Conflicts and Resolution | format = PDF| work = | publisher = International Council on Monuments and Sites | accessdate = 05 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>  Upon Sarit's death in [[8 December]] [[1963]], an unprecedented 21 days of mourning was declared in the palace.  A royal five-tier umbrella shaded his body while it lay in state.  Long-time royal advisor Phraya [[Srivisarn Vacha]] later noted that no Prime Minister ever had such an intimate relation with Bhumibol as Sarit.<ref>Thongthong Chandrangsu, A Constitutional Legal Aspect of the King's Prerogatives (M.A. thesis) Chulalongkorn University, 1986), page 160</ref>

Contemporary thinkers differ in their views about the relationship between Bhumibol and Sarit.  Paul Handley, writer of [[The King Never Smiles]], views that Sarit was Bhumibol's tool, whereas political scientist Thak Chaloemtiarana views that Sarit used Bhumibol in order to build his own credibility.<ref>ใจ อึ๊งภากรณ์, [http://www.prachatai.com/05web/th/home/page2.php?mod=mod_ptcms&ContentID=6366&SystemModuleKey=HilightNews&System_Session_Language=Thai บทความ รศ.ใจ อึ๊งภากรณ์ วิจารณ์ : The King Never Smiles], 14 ธันวาคม 2549</ref><ref>ทักษ์ เฉลิมเตียรณ, การเมืองระบบพ่อขุนอุปถัมภ์แบบเผด็จการ, สำนักพิมพ์มหาวิทยาลัยธรรมศาสตร์ 2525</ref>

===Thanom Kittikachorn era===
Field Marshal [[Thanom Kittikachorn]] was appointed premier a day after Sarit's death in 1963.  He continued most of Sarit's policies for a decade.  During the 1970s, Bhumibol was a key figure in the [[Village Scouts]] and [[Red Gaur]] paramilitary organizations. In October 1973 after massive protests and the deaths of a large number of pro-democracy demonstrators, Bhumibol opened the gates of the [[Chitralada Palace]] to fleeing protestors, and holding an audience with student leaders. Bhumibol subsequently appointed the [[Thammasat University]] Rector [[Sanya Dharmasakti]] as the new Prime Minister, replacing Thanom.  Thanom subsequently moved to the [[United States]] and [[Singapore]].  A succession of civilian governments followed, but the return of Field Marshal Thanom and his ordination as a novice monk at [[Wat Bowonniwet]] in 1976 led to renewed conflict. Protests against the ex-dictator escalated and came to a head when two newspapers published doctored photographs depicting Thammasat students hanging the Crown Prince [[Vajiralongkorn]] in effigy.<ref>{{cite web | last = Beemer | first = Bryce | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1997 | url = http://www.asiatour.com/thailand/e-01land/et-lan73.htm | title = Explorations in Southeast Asian Studies | format = | work = Forgetting and Remembering "Hok Tulaa", the October 6 Massacre| publisher = University of Hawaii | accessdate = 05 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> With the public convinced that ''[[lèse majesté]]'' had been committed, military and paramilitary forces attacked the University, leading to a [[6 October 1976 Massacre|bloody massacre]] on [[6 October]] [[1976]].

===Prem Tinsulanond era===
[[Image:Prem-King-Queen.jpg|thumb|left|210px|[[Prem Tinsulanond]] prostrate before Bhumibol and Sirikit.]] 
The ensuing chaos was used as a pretext for a military coup that same evening.  The junta submitted three names to the king to choose from to become the next Premier: Deputy President of the king's [[Privy Council]] [[Prakob Hutasingh]], right-wing Bangkok Governor [[Thamnoon Thien-ngern]], and conservative Supreme Court judge [[Thanin Kraivixien]].<ref>The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/webblog/view_blog.php?uid=492&bid=1817 His Gracious Majesty], 21 February 2007</ref>  Bhumibol chose Thanin.  Thanin was overthrown in a military coup in October 1977 by General [[Kriangsak Chomanan]]. Kriangsak was succeeded in 1980 by Army Commander-in-Chief General [[Prem Tinsulanond]], future [[Privy Council (Thailand)|Privy Council]] President.  

Bhumibol's refusal to endorse [[Manoonkrit Roopkachorn#Attempted coup of 1981|military coups in 1981 (the April Fool's Day coup)]] and [[Manoonkrit Roopkachorn#Attempted coup of 1985|1985 (the Share Rebellion)]] ultimately led to the victory of forces loyal to the government, despite much violence, and in 1981, the seizure of Bangkok by rebel forces.  The coups led many to note that Bhumibol had misjudged Thai society and that his credibility as an impartial mediator between various political and military factions had been compromised.<ref>Michael Schmicker , Asian Wall Street Journal, 23 December 1982</ref><ref>สุลักษณ์ ศิวรักษ์, "ลอกคราบสังคมไทย", กรุงเทพฯ: หนังสือไทย, 2528</ref><ref>Anonymous, "The Chakri Dynasty and Thai Politics, 1782-1982", cited in Handley, Paul M.

=== Crisis of 1992 ===
{{main|Bloody May}}
[[Image:SuchindaBhumibol.JPG|thumb|left|230px|[[Chamlong Srimuang]], Prime Minister [[Suchinda Kraprayoon]], and Privy Council President [[Prem Tinsulanonda]] prostrate before Bhumibol during [[Bloody May]], 1992.]] 
In 1992, Bhumibol played a key role in Thailand's transition to a democratic system. A coup on [[February 23]], [[1991]] put Thailand back under military dictatorship. After a general election, held in 1992, the majority parties invited General [[Suchinda Kraprayoon]], a leader of the coup group, to be the Prime Minister. This caused much dissent, and the conflict escalated to demonstrations and then to a large number of deaths when the military was brought in to control the protesters. The situation became increasingly critical as neither side would back down and the violence escalated.

Bhumibol summoned Suchinda and the leader of the pro-democracy movement, Major General [[Chamlong Srimuang]], to a televised audience. At the height of the crisis, the sight of both men appearing together on their knees (in accordance with royal protocol) made a strong impression on the nation, and led to Suchinda's resignation soon afterwards. It was one of the few public occasions where Bhumibol directly intervened in a political conflict. A general election was held shortly afterward leading to a civilian government.

=== Crisis of 2005-2006 and the September 2006 coup===
{{main|Thailand political crisis 2005-2006|Finland Plot|2006 Thailand coup d'état}}
====Before the coup====
Weeks before the [[Thailand legislative election, April 2006|April 2006 legislative election]], a coalition opposed to prime minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] (including the [[People's Alliance for Democracy]]) petitioned Bhumibol to appoint a replacement Prime Minister and Cabinet to resolve the [[Thailand political crisis 2005-2006|political crisis]]. However, demands for royal intervention met with much criticism from the public. Bhumibol, in a speech on [[April 26]], [[2006]], responded, "Asking for a Royally-appointed prime minister is undemocratic. It is, pardon me, a mess. It is irrational".<ref name="invalidate">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/27/headlines/headlines_30002592.php | title = HM the King's April 26 speeches | format = | work = | publisher = The Nation | accessdate = 2006-07-05}}</ref>

After publicly claiming victory in the boycotted [[Thailand legislative election, April 2006|April parliamentary elections]], Thaksin Shinawatra had a private audience with Bhumibol.  A few hours later, Thaksin appeared on national television to announce that he would not accept the Premiership, and would be taking leave from politics.

In May 2006, the [[Sondhi Limthongkul]]-owned [[Manager Daily]] newspaper published a series of articles describing the "[[Finland Plot]]", alleging that Thaksin and former members of the [[Communist Party of Thailand]] planned to overthrow the king and seize control of the nation.  No evidence was ever produced to verify the existence of such a plot, and Thaksin and his [[Thai Rak Thai]] party vehemently denied the accusations and sued the accusers.

In a rare, televised speech to senior judges, Bhumibol requested that the judiciary take action to resolve the political crisis.<ref name="invalidate" /> On [[May 8]], [[2006]], the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]] invalidated the results of the April elections and ordered [[Thailand legislative election, October 2006|new elections scheduled for 15 October 2006]].<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/08/headlines/headlines_30003512.php | title = Constitution Court invalidate the April election and order new election | format = | work = | publisher = The Nation | accessdate = 2006-07-05}}</ref>  The Criminal Court later jailed the Election Commissioners.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/07/25/headlines/headlines_30009521.php | title = EC Commissioners arrive at Bangkok Remand Prison | format = | work = | publisher = The Nation | accessdate = 2006-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=111195 | title = EC Guilty in Historic Ruling | format = | work = | publisher = Bangkok Post | accessdate = 2006-07-25}}</ref>

On 20 July, Bhumibol signed a royal decree endorsing new [[Thailand legislative election, October 2006|House elections for 15 October 2006]].  In an unprecedented act, the King wrote a note on the royal decree calling for a clean and fair election.

====The coup====
On the evening of [[September 19]], [[2006]], the Thai military overthrew the government and seized control of Bangkok in a bloodless coup. The junta, led by the [[Sonthi Boonyaratglin|Commander of the Army]], called itself the [[Council for Democratic Reform under the Constitutional Monarchy]] and pledged its loyalty to the King.  Martial law was declared, the Constitution repealed, and the October elections were cancelled.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060919/ap_on_re_as/thailand | title = Thai commander takes over after coup | format = | work = | publisher = Yahoo News | accessdate = 2006-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,214498,00.html | title = Thai Military Launches Coup to Remove PM Thaksin | format = | work = Associated Press | publisher = Foxnews.com | accessdate = 2006-09-19}}</ref> On 20 September, the King endorsed the coup, and asked the civil servants to take orders from Gen. Sonthi, the leader of the military coup.

The [[2006 Thailand coup d'état#Role and position of the King|King's role in the coup]] was the subject of much speculation among Thai analysts and the international media.  The King had an audience with [[Privy Council (Thailand)|Privy Council]] President General [[Prem Tinsulanonda]] at the same time the first Special Forces troops were ordered mobilized.<ref name="Timeline">The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/20/headlines/headlines_30014092.php Coup as it unfolds], 20 September 2006</ref>  In a BBC interview, [[Thitinan Pongsudhirak]] of [[Chulalongkorn University]] noted that "This coup was nothing short of Thaksin versus the King...  He is widely seen as having implicitly endorsed the coup."  In the same interview, social critic [[Sulak Sivaraksa]] claimed that "Without his involvement, the coup would have been impossible."  Sulak added that the King is "very skillful. He never becomes obviously involved. If this coup goes wrong, [[Sonthi Boonyaratglin|Sonthi]] will get the blame, but whatever happens, the King will only get praise."<ref>Kate McGeown, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5367936.stm Thai king remains centre stage], BBC News, 21 September 2006</ref>  On Saturday 23 September 2006, the junta warned they would "urgently retaliate against foreign reporters whose coverage has been deemed insulting to the monarchy."<ref>ABC News, [http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200609/s1747249.htm Thai junta vows action against foreign media], 23 September 2006</ref>  The President of Bhumibol's Privy Council, General Prem Tinsulanonda, supported the coup.  The junta later appointed Privy Council member General [[Surayud Chulanont]] as Prime Minister.

====After the coup====
On his 79th birthday, the King praised the junta leadership in a nationally televised speech, calling it “wise and experienced”.

The junta appointed a [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Tribunal]] to rule on alleged poll fraud cases concerning the [[Thai Rak Thai]] and [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat]] parties.  Guilty rulings would dissolve both parties, Thailand's largest and oldest, respectively, and ban party leadership from politics for five years.  The weeks leading up to the verdicts saw rising political tensions.  On [[24 May]] [[2007]], about a week before the scheduled verdict, Bhumibol gave a rare speech to Administrative Court judges.  "You have the responsibility to prevent the country from collapsing," he warned them in the speech, which was shown on all national television channels simultaneously during the evening.  “The nation needs political parties,” he said.  The practical meaning of Bhumibol's advice was not clear, and interpretations varied.  Some observers saw it as suggesting to the judges not make a compromise ruling.  Others saw it as a warning against dissolving the two parties.  Bhumibol, who spoke standing but in a weak, rasping voice, was careful not to say where he stood on the merits of the case.  "In my mind, I have a judgment but I cannot say," he said.  "Either way the ruling goes, it will be bad for the country, there will be mistakes."<ref>The China Post, [http://www.chinapost.com.tw/international/110557.htm Thai king urges firm, clear verdict in key case], 25 May 2007</ref><ref>Gulf Times, [http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&item_no=151176&version=1&template_id=45&parent_id=25 Thai king against dissolving parties], 25 May 2007</ref><ref>BBC, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6690441.stm Thai king warns over court ruling], 25 May 2007</ref>  The Tribunal later aquitted the Democrat Party but dissolved the Thai Rak Thai party and banned over 100 of its executives from politics for five years.

== Royal powers ==
:''For a historical perspective on how Bhumibol's constitutional powers have changed over time, see the [[Constitutions of Thailand]] article''
[[Image:King_bhumibol_monument.jpg|thumb|right|Monument to King Bhumibol in [[Phitsanulok]], Thailand]]
Bhumibol retains enormous powers, partly because of his immense popularity and partly because his powers  - although clearly defined in the [[Constitution of Thailand|Thai Constitution]] - are often subject to conflicting interpretations.  This was highlighted by the controversy surrounding the appointment of a new Auditor-General. The Constitution Court ruled in July 2004 that the appointment of [[Jaruvan Maintaka]] to this post by the State Audit Commission was unconstitutional. But Jaruvan refused to leave her position without an explicit order from Bhumibol. When the Senate approved of a replacement for Jaruvan, Bhumibol, in a very rare move, refused to approve the replacement.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = September 09, 2005 | url = http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/polcrisis/p25.php | title = ‘My govt serves His Majesty’ | format = | work = | publisher = The Nation | accessdate = 14 August | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> The Senate declined to vote to override his veto.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = October 11, 2005 | url = http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/polcrisis/p53.php | title = Senate steers clear of motion on Jaruvan | format = | work = | publisher = The Nation | accessdate = 14 August | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> Finally in February 2006 the Audit Commission reinstated Jaruvan when it became clear from a memo from the Office of the King's Principal Private Secretary that Bhumibol supported her appointment, even if it was unconstitutional.

This raised the issue of whether Bhumibol was more powerful than the Constitution. Senator [[Kaewsan Atibhodi]], a former member of the Constitution Drafting Committee, noted that under Article Seven of the 1997 Constitution said that: "whenever no provision under this Constitution is applicable to any case, it shall be decided in accordance with the constitutional practice in the democratic regime of government with the King as Head of the State”. Kaewsan interpreted this as giving Bhumibol veto powers over the Senate's appointment of Wisut Montriwat to replace Jaruvan: "Whenever [the King] considers [something as being] not beneficial to the people and being unjust, His Majesty has a veto power".<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = September 07, 2005 | url = http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/polcrisis/p20.php | title = THAMMASAT DEBATE: Royal powers forum packed | format = | work = | publisher = The Nation | accessdate = 05 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

Bhumibol had very rarely vetoed legislation.  In 1976, when the Parliament voted 149-19 to extend democratic elections down to local levels, Bhumibol refused to sign the law.<ref>{{cite book | author=Handley, Paul M. | title= The King Never Smiles: A Biography of Thailand's Bhumibol Adulyadej |publisher=Yale University Press | year=2006 | page=Page 233 |id=ISBN 0-300-10682-3}}</ref>  The Parliament refused to vote to overturn the King's veto.  In 1954, Bhumibol vetoed parliamentary-approved land reform legislation twice before consenting to sign it.<ref>{{cite book | author=Handley, Paul M. | title= The King Never Smiles: A Biography of Thailand's Bhumibol Adulyadej |publisher=Yale University Press | year=2006 | page=Page 126 |id=ISBN 0-300-10682-3}}</ref>  The law limited the maximum land any individual could hold at 50 rai (20 acres), at a time when the Crown Property Bureau was the Kingdom's largest land-owner.  The law was repealed after General Sarit overthrew the elected government in a coup.

Bhumibol's hold over Thai public opinion was demonstrated following the [[2003 Phnom Penh riots]] in Cambodia, when hundreds of Thai protesters, enraged by the burning of the Thai embassy in Phnom Penh, gathered outside the Cambodian embassy in Bangkok, ripped the Cambodian seal out of the front wall, and tried to break into the embassy. The situation was resolved peacefully when Police General Sant Sarutanonda told the crowd that he had received a call from royal secretary Arsa Sarasin conveying Bhumibol's call for calm.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2003 | url = http://www.2bangkok.com/burning.shtml | title = THE BURNING OF THE THAI EMBASSY IN CAMBODIA | format = | work = | publisher = The Nation, 2Bangkok.com | accessdate = 05 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

Bhumibol has the constitutional prerogative to pardon criminals.  The 2006 pardon of several convicted paedophiles, including an Australian rapist and child pornographer, has caused controversy.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006 | url = http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30007691 | title = Aussie pedophile free on royal pardon | format = | work = | publisher = The Nation | accessdate = 05 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = McDonald | first = Phillipa | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = June 30, 2006 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200606/s1675208.htm | title = Campaigners condemn paedophile's release | format = | work = | publisher = ABC News Online | accessdate = 05 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Bathersby | first = Damien | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = July 02, 2006 | url = http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/localnews/storydisplay.cfm?storyid=3690777&thesection=localnews&thesubsection=&thesecondsubsection=  | title = Royal pardon for child predator | format = | work = | publisher = Sunshine Coast Daily | accessdate = 05 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

== Royal projects ==
Bhumibol has been involved in many social and economic development projects, although the nature of his involvement has varied by political regime.<ref>{{cite web | last = Chitbundid | first =Chanida | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2003 | url = http://socio.tu.ac.th/For%20Web%20(soc-anth)/2546_ANTH.htm | title = The Royally-initiated Projects: The Making of Royal Hegemony (B.E. 2494-2546) | format = | work = | publisher = Thammasat University | accessdate = 06 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

The military regime of [[Plaek Pibulsonggram]] (1951-1957) suppressed the monarchy; however, during that period Bhumibol managed to initiate a few projects using his own personal funds.  These projects included the Royal Film and Radio Broadcasting Projects to help recover the palace's image.

In the military regime of [[Sarit Dhanarajata]] and his successors (1958-1980), Bhumibol was reportrayed as the "Development King," and appropriated to the economic and political goals of the regime.  Royally-initiated projects were implemented under the financial and political support of the government, including projects in rural areas and communities under the influence of the [[Communist Party of Thailand]].  Bhumibol's visits to these projects were heavily promoted by the Sarit government and broadcast on the state-controlled media.

During the civilian governments of General [[Prem Tinsulanond]] (1981-1987), the relationship between the Thai state and the monarch was at its closest.  Prem, later to become President of Bhumibol's [[Privy Council (Thailand)|Privy Council]], officially allocated government budgets and manpower to support royal projects.  Most activities in this period involved the development of large scale irrigation projects.

During the modern period (post-1988), the structured development of the Royal Projects reached its apex. Bhumibol's [[Chaipattana Foundation]] was established, promoting the [[self-sufficient economy]] theory, an alternative to the [[Export-oriented industrialization|export-oriented policies]] adopted by the period's elected governments.

== Awards ==

In May 2006, [[UN Secretary-General]], [[Kofi Annan]], presented the [[United Nations]]' first [[Human Development Lifetime Achievement Award]] to Bhumibol.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006 | url = http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=18625&Cr=Thai&Cr1= | title = With new Human Development award, Annan hails Thai King as example for the world | format = | work = | publisher = UN News Center | accessdate = 05 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

In 1960, Bhumibol was a recipient of the [[Royal Victorian Chain]], a personal award of the British Monarch.

Bhumibol, who serves as head of [[The National Scout Organization of Thailand]], was presented the [[Bronze Wolf]] award on [[June 20]], [[2006]], [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]]'s highest award, for his support and development of [[Scouting]] in Thailand by [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl XVI Gustav]], King of [[Sweden]] and Honourary President of the World Scout Foundation.  The presentation took place at [[Chitralada Palace]] in Thailand and was witnessed by Chairman of the [[World Scout Committee]] Herman Hui.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006 | url = http://www.scout.org/press/wnews/060704.shtml.en | title = His Majesty The King of Thailand awarded the Bronze Wolf | format = | work = | publisher = World Organization of the Scout Movement | accessdate = 05 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

Bhumibol set a world record for receiving the greatest number of [[Honorary degree|honorary university degrees]] (136) in 1997.<ref>{{cite book | author=Handley, Paul M. | title=The King Never Smiles |publisher=Yale University Press | year=2006 | pages=Page 417 |id=ISBN 0-300-10682-3}}</ref>  Most of his degrees came from [[List of universities in Thailand|Thai universities]]: for instance, [[Kasetsart University]] awarded him ten honorary doctoral degrees at once.

Also called the Diamond Jubilee, the 60th Anniversary Celebrations of His Majesty the King's Accession to the Throne were a series of events marking Bhumibol's reign. Events included the [[Thailand's Royal Barge Procession|royal barge procession]] on the Chao Phraya River, fireworks displays, art exhibitions, pardoning 25,000 prisoners,<ref>{{cite web | last = Pinyorat | first = Rungrawee C. | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006 | url = http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2006/06/09/millions_of_thai_honor_king | title = Millions of Thai honor king | format = | work = | publisher = Boston.com News, Associated Press | accessdate = 05 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> concerts and dance performances. Tied in with the anniversary, on [[May 26]], [[2006]] [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] presented Bhumibol with the [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s first Human Development Lifetime Achievement Award. National holidays were on June 9 and June 12&ndash;13, 2006. On June 9, the King and Queen appeared on the balcony of Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall before hundreds of thousands of people. The official royal barge procession on June 12 was attended by the King and Queen and royal visitors from 26 other countries. On June 13, a state banquet for the royal visitors was held in the newly constructed Rama IX Throne Hall at the [[Grand Palace, Bangkok|Grand Palace]], the first official function for the hall. 

The Thai people also created the official Royal Flora Expo in Chiang Mai to honor their king. It was three months long, and featured botanical exhibits from around the world. The king was prominent in several of the exhibits.

On [[16 January]] [[2007]], the [[CDRM|junta]] officially declared the end of the 60th anniversary celebrations and commenced year-long celebrations of Bhumibol's 80th birthday.<ref>The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/02/16/headlines/headlines_30027071.php Govt launches commemorative events for HM the King's 80th birthday], 16 February 2007</ref>

== Private life ==
Bhumibol is a painter, photographer, author and translator. His book ''Phra Mahachanok'' is based on a traditional ''[[Jataka]]'' story of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] scripture.

In his youth, Prince Bhumibol was greatly interested in firearms.<ref>{{cite book | author=Handley, Paul M. | title=The King Never Smiles |publisher=Yale University Press | year=2006 | pages=Page 70 |id=ISBN 0-300-10682-3}}</ref> He kept a [[carbine]], a [[Sten gun]], and two automatic [[pistols]] in his bedroom, and he and brother, King [[Ananda Mahidol]], often used the gardens of the [[Grand Palace, Bangkok|Baromphiman Palace]] for target practice.

Bhumibol suffers from [[spinal stenosis|lumbar spine stenosis]], a narrowing of the canal that contains the [[spinal cord]] and nerve roots, which results in back and leg pain and numbness in the legs.  He received a microsurgical decompression in July 2006.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=109508_19114638.html | title = Doctors to Permfom Surgery on Thai king, 78 | format = | work = | publisher = Bangkok Post | accessdate = 20 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30008905 | title = Doctors to perform surgery to cure lumbar spine stenosis for His Majesty | format = | work = Breaking News | publisher = The Nation | accessdate = 20 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>
=== Music ===
Bhumibol is also an accomplished jazz musician and composer. He was the first Asian composer awarded honorary membership of the Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts in Vienna at the age of 32.<ref>{{cite web | last = Tang | first = Alisa | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006-06-13 | url = http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2006/06/13/thailands_monarch_is_ruler_jazz_musician/?rss_id=Boston.com+%2F+News| title = Thailand's monarch is ruler, jazz musician | format = | work = | publisher = Boston.com News, Associated Press | accessdate = 2007-02-28}}</ref> He used to play jazz music on air on the Or Sor radio station.

His songs can often be heard at social gatherings and are performed in concerts. They can be listened to [http://kanchanapisek.or.th/royal-music/index.en.html here].

=== Sailing ===
Bhumibol is an accomplished sailor and sailboat designer.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = Feb 6,  2006 | url = http://www.bangkokpost.net/60yrsthrone/art/index.html | title = The Heart for Art | format = | work = | publisher = Bangkok Post | accessdate = 20 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>  He won a gold medal for sailing in the Fourth [[1967 Southeast Asian Peninsular Games|Southeast Asian Peninsular (SEAP) Games]] in 1967, together with HRH Princess [[Ubol Ratana]] who he tied for points.<ref>{{cite web | last = Cummins | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = Dec 2004 | url = http://www.chiangmai-mail.com/111/special.shtml | title = His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great: Monarch of Peace and Unity | format = | work = | publisher = Chiang Mai Mail | accessdate = 20 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>  This accomplishment is all the more remarkable given Bhumibol's lack of binocular [[depth perception]]. Bhumibol has also sailed the [[Gulf of Thailand]] from [[Hua Hin]] to Toey Harbour in [[Sattahip]], covering 60 nautical miles in a 14-hour journey on the "Vega 1", an [[OK (dinghy)|OK Class dinghy]] he built.

Like his [[Mahidol Adulyadej|father]], a former naval engineer, Bhumibol was an avid boat designer and builder.  He produced several small sail-boat designs in the International [[Enterprise (dinghy)|Enterprise]], [[OK (dinghy)|OK]], and [[Moth (dinghy)|Moth]] Classes.  His designs in the Moth class include the “Mod”, “Super Mod”, and “Micro Mod”.

== Wealth ==
Bhumibol is one of the wealthiest men in the world. Estimates of the [[Asian economic crisis|post-devaluation]] (circa 1997-1998) wealth of the royal household range from 2 billion to 8 billion USD (approx. 80 - 320 billion THB).<ref>{{cite web | last = Horn | first = Robert | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = December 06, 1999 | url = http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1206/thai3.moneyman.html | title = The Banker Who Saved A King | format = | work = | publisher = Time Asia | accessdate = 05 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>  The wealth and properties of Bhumibol and his family are managed by the [[Crown Property Bureau]] (CPB) and the Privy Purse.  The CPB was established by law but is independent of the Thai Government.  Through the CPB, Bhumibol owns massive amounts of land and equity in many companies.  The CPB is the majority shareholder of [[Siam Cement]] (the largest Thai industrial conglomerate), [[Christiani & Nielsen]] (one of the largest construction firms), [[Deves Insurance]] (one of the largest insurers), [[Siam Commercial Bank]] (one of the largest banks), and [[Shin Corporation]] (a major telecommunications firm, through the CPB's holdings in Siam Commercial Bank).   The CPB also rents or leases about 36,000 properties to third parties, including the sites of the [[Four Seasons Hotel Bangkok]], the [[Suan Lum Night Bazaar]], [[Siam Paragon]] and [[Central World Plaza#Central World Tower|Central World Tower]].  The CPB spearheaded a plan to turn Bangkok’s historical [[Rajadamnoen]] Avenue into a shopping street known as the “[[Champs-Élysées]] of Asia” and in 2007, shocked longtime residents of traditional marketplace districts by giving them eviction notices.<ref name="sentinel">Asia Sentinel, [http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=402&Itemid=32], Thailand's Royal Wealth, 1 March 2007</ref>   Bhumibol's substantial income from the CPB, at least five billion [[baht]] in 2004 alone, is exempt from taxes.<ref>According to Section 8 of the [http://www.crownproperty.or.th/history.php Royal Assets Structuring Act of 1936] (พระราชบัญญัติ จัดระเบียบทรัพย์สิน ฝ่ายพระมหากษัตริย์)</ref><ref name="sentinel" />  The CPB receives many state privileges.  Although the Ministry of Finance technically runs the CPB, in reality the decisions are made by Bhumibol.  The CPB's annual report is for the eyes of Bhumibol alone.<ref name="sentinel" />

In addition, the King has numerous personal investments independent of the CPB.  He is personally the majority shareholder of the Thai Insurance Company (a leading insurer) and Sammakorn (a leading property developer), as well as many other companies.<ref>See Stock Exchange of Thailand Report 56-1 for [http://www.set.or.th/dat/finreport/form56/0019F56300320060533533564T.zip TIC] and [http://www.set.or.th/dat/finreport/form56/0349F56310320060432572107T.zip SAMCO]</ref>

Bhumibol's personal aircraft is a [[Boeing 737-800]].  He has two spare aircraft: an [[Airbus 319-300]] and an [[Airbus ACJ319]] (dubbed "[[Air Force One]]" by the media) that had been purchased by the [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] government for government use.  Both Airbuses are used by other members of the royal family.<ref>The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/04/21/national/national_30032343.php King's new aircraft arrives, with 'Air Force One' in reserve], 21 April 2007</ref>

==Lèse majesté==
Although the King is held in great respect by many Thais, he is also protected by [[lèse majesté]] laws which allow critics to be jailed for three to 15 years.  The laws were toughened during the dictatorship of royalist Premier [[Tanin Kraivixien]], such that criticism of any member of the royal family, the royal development projects, the royal institution, the Chakri Dynasty, or any previous Thai King was also banned.<ref>The original penalty was a maximum of 7 years imprisonment, but was toughened to a minimum of 3 years and a maximum of 15 years.  This harsher sentence has been retained to the current day, see Colum Murphy, "[http://www.feer.com/articles1/2006/0609/free/p023.html A Tug of War for Thailand’s Soul]", Far Eastern Economic Review, September 2006.  As stipulated under the Constitution, [[lese-majeste]] only applied to criticism of the [[Bhumibol|King]], [[Sirikit|Queen]], [[Vajiralongkorn|Crown Prince]], and Regent.  Tanin, a former Supreme Court justice, reinterpretted this as a blanket ban against criticism of [[Bhumibol Adulyadej#Royal projects|royal development projects]], the royal institution, the [[Chakri Dynasty]], or any [[Kings of Thailand|Thai King]].  See David Streckfuss, "Kings in the Age of Nations: The Paradox of Lèse-Majesté as Political Crime in Thailand", Comparative Studies in Society and History 37 (3): 445-475.  The reinterpretation has stood to the present day.</ref>  Jail terms for Thai citizens committing lèse majesté are usually harsher than for foreigners.  Social critic [[Sulak Sivaraksa]] has been charged several times with lèse majesté, but has always been acquitted.  Politician Veera Musikapong was jailed and banned from politics for lèse majesté, despite the palace's opinion that the remarks were harmless.

Acts deemed insulting to the King's image are also criminal offenses in Thailand.  Charges may be filed by anybody, except for the King himself.  In 2007, Oliver Jufer, a [[Swiss]] man, was sentenced to 10 years in jail for daubing black paint on portraits of Bhumibol while drunk <ref>BBC, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6505237.stm Swiss man jailed for Thai insult], 29 March 2007</ref>.  The Thai press was requested not to publish any information about the case.

Another high-profile case is the banning of [[YouTube]]. On April 4th, 2007, the Thai government blocked Thai access to YouTube as a result of a video clip which it deemed insulting to the king.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/04/05/tech/main2651336.shtml Thai YouTube Ban Persists Over King Clip] AP (via CBS), April 5, 2007, retrieved April 8, 2007</ref><ref> [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6532137.stm More Thai king videos on YouTube] BBC, April 5, 2007, retrieved April 8, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/04/06/thailand.youtube.reut/ New Thai king clips on YouTube], BBC, April 6, 2007, retrieved April 8, 2007</ref>  Various leaders of the military junta claimed that the clip was an attempt to undermine the monarchy, attack Thailand as a country, and threaten national security.<ref>The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/04/16/opinion/opinion_30031941.php Inconvenient truths of censorship], 16 April 2007</ref> (''See [[Media of Thailand#YouTube Controversy]])

There is controversy over whether criticism of members of the King's Privy Council also qualifies as criticism of the King.<ref>Bangkok Post, [http://pages.citebite.com/v1x4o9y3g2jxi Authorities close in on Prem's foes], 5 April 2007</ref>  Police Special Branch Commander Lt-General Theeradech Rodpho-thong refused to file charges of lèse majesté against activitists who launched a petition to oust Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda, claiming that the law only  applied to members of the royal family.<ref>The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/04/03/headlines/headlines_30030967.php Row festers over website seeking to oust Prem], 3 April 2007</ref>  Two days later, he was demoted by Police Commander [[Seripisut Temivavej]].<ref>The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/04/05/headlines/headlines_30031154.php Special Branch chief demoted in reshuffle], 5 April 2007</ref>

Bhumibol himself stated that he was not above criticism in his 2005 birthday speech.  "Actually, I must also be criticised. I am not afraid if the criticism concerns what I do wrong, because then I know. Because if you say the king cannot be criticised, it means that the king is not human," he said.  Despite this, few have dared to call for the repeal of the law.  Any doing so have been accused of disloyalty and could also be charged with lèse majesté.<ref>Al Jazeera, [http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/23449886-635A-44C9-A116-DDAEB5F9863C.htm Swiss man 'insulted' Thai king], 12 March 2007</ref>  Political scientist [[Giles Ungpakorn]] noted that "the lèse majesté laws are not really designed to protect the institution of the monarchy.  In the past the laws have been used to protect governments, to protect military coups. This whole [royal] image is created to bolster a conservative elite well beyond the walls of the palace."

== Biographies ==
American journalist Paul Handley, who spent thirteen years in Thailand, wrote the biography ''[[The King Never Smiles]]''. The [[Thailand Ministry of Information and Communication Technology|Information and Communications Ministry]] banned the book and blocked the book's page on the Yale University Press website in January 2006.  In a statement dated 19 January 2006, Thai National Police Chief General [[Kowit Wattana]] said the book has "contents which could affect national security and the good morality of the people."<ref>{{cite web | last = Warrick-Alexander | first = James| authorlink = | coauthors = | year = February 06, 2006 | url = http://www.yaledailynews.com/article.asp?AID=31649 | title = Thailand Bars  Univ. Website | format = | work = | publisher = Yale Daily News | accessdate = 05 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>  The book provides a detailed discussion of Bhumibol's role in Thai political history and also analyses the factors behind Bhumibol's popularity, though it is sometimes based on rumors which cannot be confirmed.

[[William Stevenson (Canadian writer)|William Stevenson]], who had access to the Royal Court and the Royal Family, wrote the biography ''The Revolutionary King'' in 2001.<ref>{{cite book | author=Stevenson, William | title=The Revolutionary King |publisher=Constable and Robinson | year=2001 | pages= |id=ISBN 1-84119-451-4}}</ref> An article in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' says the idea for the book was suggested by Bhumibol.<ref name="Time magazine">{{cite web | last = McCarthy | first = Terry | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = December 06, 1999 | url = http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1206/thai1.king.html | title = The King and Ire | format = | work = | publisher = Time Asia | accessdate = 05 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> 

Critics noted that the book displays intimate knowledge about personal aspects of Bhumibol. However, the book has been unofficially banned in Thailand and the Royal Household Bureau has warned the Thai media about even referring to it in print. (An official ban was not possible as it was written with the Royal blessing). The book has been criticised for factual inaccuracies, disrespecting  Bhumibol (it refers to Bhumibol by his family nickname "Lek"), and proposing a controversial theory explaining the death of King Ananda. Stevenson said, "The King said from the beginning the book would be dangerous for him and for me."<ref name="Time magazine" />

== Succession to the throne ==
Bhumibol's only son, Prince [[Vajiralongkorn]], was given the title "Somdej Phra Boroma Orasadhiraj Chao Fah Maha Vajiralongkorn Sayam Makutrajakuman" (Crown Prince of Siam) on [[December 28]], [[1972]] and made heir apparent to the throne in accordance with the [[Palace Law on Succession of 1924]].  

On [[December 5]], [[1977]], Princess [[Sirindhorn]] was given the title, "Sayam Boromrajakumari" (Royal Princess of Siam).  Her title is often translated by the English-language press as "Crown Princess", although her official English-language title is simply "Princess".<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2004 | url = http://kanchanapisek.or.th/biography/sirindhorn/index.en.html | title = Biography of Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn | format = | work = | publisher = The Golden Jubilee Network | accessdate = 05 July | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

Although the [[Constitution of Thailand|constitution]] was later amended to allow the [[Privy Council (Thailand)|Privy Council]] to appoint a princess as successor to the throne, this would only occur in the absence of an heir apparent.  This amendment is retained in Section 23 of the current [[Constitution of Thailand|1997 "People's Constitution."]]  This effectively signalled Princess [[Sirindhorn]] as second in line to the throne, but did not affect Prince [[Vajiralongkorn]]'s status as heir apparent.

Recent constitutions of Thailand have made the amendment of the [[1924 Palace Law of Succession|Palace Law of Succession]] the sole prerogative of the reigning King.  According to Gothom Arya, former Election Commissioner, this allows the reigning King, if he so chooses, to appoint his son or any of his daughters to the Throne.<ref>{{cite web | last = Aryan | first = Gothan | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = September 15-16, 2004 | url = http://www.idea.int/news/upload/Nepal%20-%20Thai%20monarchy%20paper%20-%20Gothom%20Aryan.pdf | title = Thai Monarchy | format = PDF | work = | publisher = International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance | accessdate = 05 July | accessyear = 2006}} presented in Kathmandu, Nepal</ref>
