'''Homer Jacobson''' is a former chemistry professor at [[Brooklyn College]], [[New York City]]. 

In the 1950s he illustrated basic [[self-replication]] in [[artificial life]] with a model train set.{{Fact|date=October 2007}} A seed "organism" consisting of a "head" and "tail" boxcar could use the simple rules of the system to consistently create new "organisms" identical to itself, so long as there was a random pool of new boxcars to draw from.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

In [[1955 in science|1955]] he published "Information, Reproduction and the Origin of Life," in ''[[American Scientist]]''.  In [[2007 in science|2007]], he retracted two passages of this work after realizing that errors in his paper were being misread as evidence for [[creationism]].<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=2007-10-25|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/25/science/25jacobson.html|title=’55 ‘Origin of Life’ Paper Is Retracted|author=Cornelia Dean}}</ref>
