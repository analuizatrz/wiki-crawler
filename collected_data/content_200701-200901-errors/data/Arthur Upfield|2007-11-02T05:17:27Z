'''Arthur William Upfield''' ([[1 September]] [[1890]] - [[13 February]] [[1964 in Australia|1964]]) was an [[Australia]]n writer, best known for his works of [[detective fiction]] featuring Detective Inspector [[Napoleon Bonaparte (fictional detective)|Napoleon Bonaparte]] ('Bony') of the Queensland Police Force.

== Biography ==
Upfield was born in [[Gosport]], [[Hampshire]], [[England]] on 1 September 1890. <ref name="Liukkonen">{{cite web| author=Petri Liukkonen| year=2003 | url= http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/aupfiel.htm | title=Arthur Upfield (1890*-1964) | work=Books and Writers

For most of the next twenty years he travelled throughout the [[outback]] working at a number of jobs. He learnt much of Aboriginal culture, later to be used in his books. 

With the outbreak of [[World War I]], he joined the [[First Australian Imperial Force]] on 23 August 1914.<ref name = "rabbit">{{cite book | first = Terry | last = Walker | year = 1993| title = Murder on the Rabbit Proof Fence: The strange case of Arthur Upfield and Snowy Rowles| publisher = Hesperian Press | location = Carlisle, Western Australia | id = ISBN 0-85905-189-7 }}</ref> Upfield sailed from [[Brisbane]] on the [[HMAT Anglo Egyptian]] on [[24 September]] 1914 to Melbourne.

Upfield created the character of Detective Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte, based on a man known as 'Tracker Leon' whom he had met in his travels.  Leon Wood was a [[half-caste]] [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigine]] who was employed as a [[Tracker (occupation)|tracker]] by the [[Queensland Police]].<ref name="Liukkonen"/>The novels featuring 'Bony', as the character was also known, were far more successful than other Upfield writings.

Late in life Upfield became a prominent member of the [[Australian Geological Society]], involved in scientific expeditions.<ref name="periodictable"/> In particular he led a major expedition in 1948 to northern and western parts of Australia in 1948, including the [[Wolfe Creek crater]]. The Wolfe Creek crater was a setting for his novel ''The Will of the Tribe'' published in 1962.<ref name="KeesDeHoog">{{ cite web | author=Kees de Hoog | year=2004 | url=http://www.collectingbooksandmagazines.com/upfield.html | title=Arthur W.

After living at [[Bermagui, New South Wales]], Upfield moved to Jasmine Street, [[Bowral, New South Wales]]. Upfield died at Bowral on 13 February, 1964. His last work, ''The Lake Frome Monster'', published in 1966, was completed by J.L. Price and Dorothy Stange.

In 1957, his second wife, Jessica Hawke, published a biography of the author entitled ''Follow My Dust!''.  It is generally held however, that this was written by Upfield himself.<ref name="ABCB&W"/>

Upfield's novels were held in high regard by some fellow writers.  In 1987, [[H.R.F. Keating]] included ''The Sands of Windee'' (1931) in his list of the 100 best crime and mystery books ever published.  [[J.B. Priestley]] wrote of Upfield: "If you like detective stories that are something more than puzzles, that have solid characters and backgrounds, that avoid familiar patterns of crime and detection, then Mr Upfield is your man." Others have found Upfield's prose stilted.  Much of the appeal of Arthur Upfield's stories lies in the depiction of outback Australian life in the 1930s through into the 1950s.

In ''The Sands of Windee'', a story about a "perfect murder", Upfield invented a method to destroy carefully all evidence of the crime.  Upfield's "Windee method" was used in a true-life crime, [[The Murchison Murders]].

Upfield's novels were very popular in America (originally because so many American servicemen stationed out there during WW2 read them and brought copies back), England and translated into [[German language|German]].

From 1972 - 1973 a 26-episode television series was produced by Fauna Productions (the folks who brought you ''[[Skippy the Bush Kangaroo]]''). After a long search for a half-white, half-Aborigine actor, the producers chose English actor Jon Finch for the role of Detective Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte.  When he suddenly became unavailable, Fauna's John McCallum flew to London in panic, and was lucky enough to audition New Zealand actor [[James Laurenson]] on his last day there.  Offered the lead role, Laurenson hurriedly flew to Australia, reading "Bony" books all the way over.
The series was called ''Boney'', partly to make the pronunciation of the name more obvious, and partly because that had been Upfield's original intention - a publisher's  misprint on the first novel had renamed the character!  Most of the episodes were based directly on one of the novels, but there were some adaptations.  Two original scripts were not directly based on any novel; five novels were not adapted for television, effectively ‘reserving’ them in case a third series eventuated. At the time, many of the books were reprinted with the spelling altered to ‘Boney’ on the covers (although retaining the original in the text), and featuring a photo from the relevant episode.[http://www.classicaustraliantv.com/Boney.htm]
