==Biography==
===Ethnic background===

Nelly Furtado was born in the [[Canada|Canadian]] city of [[Victoria, British Columbia]] to [[Portugal|Portuguese]] immigrants from the [[Azores]], Maria Manuela and António José Furtado. Her parents were born in the [[São Miguel Island]] and immigrated to Canada in the late 1960s.<ref name=rsjan01>

===Early years=== 

Nelly Furtado was named after [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[gymnast]] [[Nellie Kim]].<ref name=ym/> Raised in a [[Roman Catholic]] home, Furtado first sang at the age of four when she performed a duet with her mother at a church on [[Portugal Day]]. Although remaining unclear about her religious beliefs, she still affirms a belief in God, the Ten Commandments, and in avoiding the [[Seven Sins]].<ref name=ym/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nellyfurtado/articles/story/5931858/fly_girl|title=Fly Girl|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> She began playing instruments at the age of nine, learning the [[trombone]], [[ukulele]] and, in later years, the [[guitar]] and [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]]. At the age of twelve, she began writing songs,<ref name=ym/> and as a teenager, she performed in a Portuguese [[marching band]].<ref name=rsjan01/>   
Furtado has acknowledged her family as the source of her strong work ethic; she spent eight summers working as a [[chambermaid]] with her mother, who was a [[Housekeeper (servant)|housekeeper]] in Victoria.<ref name=amg> {{cite web|url=http://www.allmusicguide.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:lcaxlfjekcqe~T1|title=Nelly Furtado Biography|work=All Music Guide|accessdate=27 May|accessyear=2006}}</ref> She has stated that coming from a working class background has shaped her identity in a positive way.<ref name=ym/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nellyfurtado/articles/story/5931858/fly_girl|title=Fly Girl |work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=16 Aug|accessyear=2001}}</ref>

The first musicians Furtado interacted with were underground [[Rapping|rappers]] and [[Disc jockey|DJs]].<ref name=mtv>
{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/f/furtado_nelly/qa_feature_060706/|title=How Nelly Furtado Got Her Ghetto Pass|work=MTV|accessdate=16 August |accessyear=2006 | last=Shepherd | first=Julianne}}
</ref> During a visit to [[Toronto]] the summer after eleventh grade, Furtado met Tallis Newkirk, member of the [[hip hop]] group Plains of Fascination. She contributed vocals to their 1996 album, ''Join the Ranks'', on the track "Waitin' 4 the Streets".<ref name=nelstar> {{cite web |url=http://www.nelstar-project.com/about/nelstar|title=Nelstar* (Nelly Furtado) Biography|work=Nelstar-Project.com|accessdate=9 December |accessyear=2005}}
</ref>  After graduating from [[Mount Douglas Secondary School]] in 1996, she moved to Toronto.  The following year, she formed Nelstar, a [[trip hop]] duo with Newkirk.  Ultimately, Furtado felt the trip-hop style of the duo was "too segregated" and believed it did not represent her personality or allow her to showcase her vocal ability.<ref name=nelstar/> She left the group and planned to move back home.

Before moving, however, she performed at the 1997 Honey Jam, an "all-female urban" talent show.<ref name=nelstar/><ref name=honeyjam>{{cite web |url = http://www.chartattack.com/damn/2003/05/2705.cfm | title = Honey Jam Searches for Urban Women | work = ChartAttack | date = [[2003-05-27]]}}
</ref> Her performance attracted the attention of [[The Philosopher Kings]] singer [[Gerald Eaton]] (aka Jarvis Church), who then approached her to write with him. He and fellow Kings member [[Brian West]] helped Furtado produce a [[Demo (music)|demo]]. She left Toronto, but returned again to record more material with Eaton and West. The material recorded during these sessions led to her 1999 record deal with [[DreamWorks Records]].<ref name=mm/> Furtado's first single, "[[Party's Just Begun (Again)]]", was released that year on the ''[[Brokedown Palace: Music from the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]''.

Furtado continued the collaboration with Eaton and West, who co-produced her debut album, ''[[Whoa, Nelly!]]'' which was released in October 2000.

Following the release of the album, Furtado headlined the [[Burn in the Spotlight Tour]] and also appeared on [[Moby]]'s ''[[Area Festival|Area:One]]'' tour. 

The album was an international success, supported by three international singles: "[[I'm like a Bird]]", "[[Turn off the Light]]", and "[[...On the Radio (Remember the Days)]]".  It received four [[Grammy Award]] nominations in 2002, and her debut single won for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]].
Furtado's work was also critically acclaimed for her innovative mixture of various genres and sounds. ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' called the album "a delightful and refreshing antidote to the army of 'pop princesses' and rap-metal bands that had taken over popular music at the turn of the millennium."<ref name=slant74>
{{cite web |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=74|title=Whoa, Nelly!|work=Slant|accessdate=28 May|accessyear=2006}}
</ref>  

The sound of the album was strongly influenced by musicians who had traversed cultures and "the challenge of making heartfelt, emotional music that's upbeat and hopeful."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maplemusic.com/artists/nfu/bio.asp|title=Nelly Furtado Biography|work=MapleMusic|accessdaymonth=27 May |accessyear=2006}}</ref>. According to ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine, ''Whoa, Nelly!'' had sold five million copies worldwide as of August 2006.<ref>Intini, John. [http://www.macleans.ca/culture/music/article.jsp?content=20060828_132446_132446 "Nelly Furtado: 'I'm not Mother Teresa'"]. ''[[Maclean's]]''. [[August 25]], [[2006]]. Retrieved [[September 18]] [[2006]].</ref>

The song "Scared of You" has portions of the song in Portuguese, while "Onde Estás" is entirely in Portuguese, reflecting Furtado's Portuguese heritage.

Furtado's second album, ''[[Folklore (album)|Folklore]]'', was released in November 2003. The final track on the album, "Childhood Dreams", was dedicated to her daughter, Nevis. The album includes the single "[[Força]]" (meaning "strength" or "carry on" in Portuguese), the official anthem of the [[2004 European Football Championship]].  Furtado performed this song in [[Lisbon]] at the championship's final, in which the Portugal national team played.<ref name=rs35794>

{{cquote|I always know there's a new genre left to discover. For me, it's like a metaphor for life. I feel like if you can get down with any style of music, you can get down with any style of person. So it's fun for me—I get to expose my fans to different vibes and they, in turn, open their minds too. I'm always undergoing mind-opening.}}
