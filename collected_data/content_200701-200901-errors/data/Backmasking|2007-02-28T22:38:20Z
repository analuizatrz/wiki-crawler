'''Backmasking''' (also incorrectly<ref>Backward masking actually refers to a phenomenon in which two images are flashed quickly, and the second "covers up" part or all of the first. See {{cite web|last=Crispen|first=Bob|title=Backward Masking... another pious fraud|url=http://www.crispen.org/rants/backward.html|accessdate=2006-09-01}}</ref> known as [[backward masking]]) is an audio technique in which sounds are recorded backwards onto a track that is meant to be played forwards. Backmasking is a deliberate process, whereas a ''backward message'' may be unintentional. Backmasking has been a source of much controversy, especially related to supposed [[subliminal message]]s in rock music.

== Beginnings ==
The practice of manipulating recorded music began in the late [[1950s]] with the advent of ''[[musique concrète]]''. This [[avant-garde]] form of [[electronic music]] involved [[audio editing|editing]] together fragments of natural and industrial sounds.

[[The Beatles]], who incorporated the techniques of ''concrète'' into their recordings, were responsible for popularizing the concept of backmasking. [[John Lennon]] played the tapes for "[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]", a song from ''[[Revolver (album)|Revolver]]'', in reverse. Lennon, who at the time was high on [[cannabis]], enjoyed the sound of the song being played backwards, and shared the results with the other Beatles the following day.<ref name="Ev">{{cite web|last=Olcott|first=Ev|title=Audio Reversal In Popular Culture|url=http://www.triplo.com/ev/reversal/|accessdate=2006-08-26}}</ref> He then wrote "[[Rain (The Beatles song)|Rain]]", intending the song to be recorded entirely backwards; but [[George Martin]] (who claims ''he'' discovered the backwards effect) rejected this, and only the final verse was played backwards.

Backwards effects (reversed speech or other sound effects) are often used by record producers.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Skeptic's Dictionary]]|title=Reader comments: backwards satanic messages|url=http://skepdic.com/comments/backcom.html|accessdate=2006-08-26}}</ref>

== Alleged backmasking ==
=== Hidden messages ===
In the autumn of 1969 Detroit-area DJ [[Russell Gibb]] received a phone call from an anonymous caller<ref>http://www.larrymonroe.com/archive/archive11.html</ref> that initiated the infamous "[[Paul Is Dead]]" [[urban legend]] (a rumor that Beatle [[Paul McCartney]] had died) by playing certain Beatles records backwards to reveal hidden messages. One album in particular, ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' (often called ''The White Album'') was said to contain backwards messages. Intentional gibberish at the end of "I'm So Tired" was supposedly "Paul is dead, man, miss him, miss him..."<ref>{{cite web|title=Backmask Online: Classic Rock|url=http://www.backmaskonline.com/classicrock.html|accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref> Likewise, the repeated words "Number nine, number nine, number nine..." in "[[Revolution 9]]" were supposedly "turn me on, dead man, turn me on, dead man..." backwards, and the gibberish on the inner play out groove of the Sgt. Pepper album supposedly said "We will fuck you like supermen".<ref>http://www.rollingstone.com/news/profile/story/9359339/the_rs_interview_paul_mccartney</ref>

Another well-known example of alleged backmasking is found in rock group [[Led Zeppelin]]'s [[1970 in music|1971]] song "[[Stairway to Heaven]]." If a portion of the song is played backwards, then supposedly words beginning with "Here's to my sweet Satan" can be heard<ref>http://jeffmilner.com/backmasking.htm</ref>. But [[Swan Song Records]] issued the statement: "Our turntables only play in one direction&mdash;forwards"<ref>http://www.led-zeppelin.org/reference/int18.htm</ref>. And Led Zeppelin vocalist [[Robert Plant]] denied the accusations in an interview<ref>http://www.led-zeppelin.org/reference/int18.html</ref>: "To me it's very sad, because 'Stairway To Heaven' was written with every best intention, and as far as reversing tapes and putting messages on the end, that's not my idea of making music."

Serial killer [[Richard Ramirez]] claimed that [[AC/DC]]'s music, and specifically the song "Night Prowler" on ''[[Highway to Hell (album)|Highway to Hell]]'', inspired him to commit murder.<ref>http://www.av1611.org/rock.html</ref> [[David John Oates]] claimed that "Highway to Hell", on the same album, contains backmasked messages including "I'm the law", "my name is Lucifer", and "she belongs in hell".<ref>http://www.reversespeech.com/esotera.htm</ref> AC/DC's [[Angus Young]] responded that "you didn't need to play [the album] backwards, because we never hid [the messages]. We'd call an album Highway To Hell, there it was right in front of them."<ref>http://www.sylviesimmons.com/interviews.php?interview=ACDC</ref>

<!-- This sentence is not for listing all artists who have been accused. It should only be used for major controversies involving notable artists. -->Other artists accused of backmasking include [[The Eagles]]<ref>{{pt icon}} http://whiplash.net/materias/ocultismo/000112-ledzeppelin.html</ref>, [[Queen (band)|Queen]]<ref>http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_article.html?a=cabc&id=4759</ref>, [[Black Oak Arkansas]]<ref name="poundstone">{{cite book|last=Poundstone|first=William|title=Big Secrets|date=1983|publisher=William Morrow and Company|location=[[New York City]]|id=ISBN 0-688-04830-7|url=http://www.crispen.org/rants/secrets.html|accessdate=2006-08-23}}</ref>, [[Britney Spears]]<ref>http://www.badmouth.net/britney-spears-wants-to-have-sex-with-you/</ref>, and [[Rush (band)|Rush]]<ref>http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/10252/For_Whom_Hells_Bells_Toll</ref>.

=== Skepticism ===
Audio engineer Ev Olcott claims that messages by artists including Queen and Led Zeppelin are coincidental phonetic reversals, in which the spoken or sung [[phoneme]]s form new combinations of words when listened to backwards.<ref name="Ev" />

[[Michael Shermer]] claims that the emergence of the [[Paul is dead]] phenomenon, including the alleged message at the end of "I'm So Tired", was caused by faulty perception of a pattern. Shermer argues that the human brain evolved with a strong [[pattern recognition]] ability that was necessary to process the large amount of [[noise]] in man's environment, but that today this ability leads to [[false positive]]s.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shermer|first=Michael|title=Turn Me On, Dead Man|year=2005|month=May|publisher=[[Scientific American]]|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000EB977-12BE-1264-8F9683414B7FFE9F|accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref>

[[Stanford University]] psychology professor Brian Wandell argues that the observance of backward messages is a mistake arising from this pattern recognition facility.<ref name="Holguin">{{cite news|last=Holguin|first=Jaime|title=Backmasking unmasked! Music site's in heavy rotation|date=2006-02-27|publisher=[[Seattle Times]]|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/artsentertainment/2002828774_backmasking27.html|accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref> 

In [[1985]], [[university]] [[psychologist]]s John R. Vokey and J. Don Read conducted a study using [[Psalm 23]] from the [[Bible]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]," and various other sound passages made up for the experiment. Vokey and Read concluded that "we could find no effect of the meaning of engineered, backward messages on listeners’ behaviour, either consciously or unconsciously"<ref>John Vokey: [http://people.uleth.ca/~vokey/pdf/Submess.pdf Subliminal Messages]</ref>.

=== Subliminal persuasion ===
{{further|[[Subliminal message]]}}

Gary Greenwald, a [[fundamentalist Christian]] preacher, claims that backmasked messages can be heard subliminally, and can induce listeners towards, in the case of rock music, sex and drug use.<ref>{{cite book|title=Psychological Sketches|editors=John R. Vokey and Scott W. Allen|edition=6th edition|date=2002|publisher=Psyence Ink|location=Lethbridge, Alberta|chapter=Subliminal Messages|pages=223-246|last=Vokey|first=John R.|url=people.uleth.ca/~vokey/pdf/Submess.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2006-07-05}}</ref> However, this is not generally accepted as fact.<ref>{{cite web|title=Backmasking on records: Real, or hoax?|last=Robinson|first=B.A.|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_cul5.htm|accessdate=2006-07-04}}</ref>

Following the subliminal message panic of the 1950s, in which the notion of subliminal messages was popularized, many businesses have sprung up purporting to offer helpful subliminal audio. They offer subliminal tapes that supposedly improve the health of the listener. However, there is no evidence for the therapeutic effectiveness of such tapes.<ref name="perception">{{cite news|work=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|date=Spring 1992|publisher=[[Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal]]|title=Subliminal Perception: Facts and Fallacies|pages=273-81|last=Moore|first=Timothy E.|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/9204/subliminal-perception.htm|accessdate=2006-08-11}}</ref>

In 1985, British [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Judas Priest]] was sued over a [[suicide pact]] made by two [[Nevada]] schoolboys. One of the two boys survived, and the lawsuit by their families claimed that a 1978 Judas Priest album contained hidden messages. The words "Do it" were allegedly audible when the record was played backwards, and the letters S U I (supposedly for "suicide") are in the sleeve artwork. The case was dismissed after evidence was introduced that the boys had grown up in "violent and depressed" surroundings, and after the band demonstrated that other, nonsensical, backwards messages could be found if one exercised enough imagination. The judge's ruling stated that "The scientific research presented does not establish that subliminal stimuli, even if perceived, may precipitate conduct of this magnitude. There exist other factors which explain the conduct of the deceased independent of the subliminal stimuli." Judas Priest members also commented that if they wanted to insert subliminal commands in their music, killing their fans would be counterproductive, and they would prefer to insert the command "Buy more of our records."

The conclusion made by Vokey and Read in the study described above was that if backmasking did indeed exist, it was ineffective. Their volunteers had trouble even noticing the backmasked phrase when the tape was played forward, were unable to judge the type of message (whether it was Christian, Satanic, or commercial) it contained, and were not led to behave in any certain way as a result of being "exposed" to the backmasked phrase. Due to this research, Vokey and Read were later called upon as expert witnesses in the above-mentioned trial involving the band Judas Priest.

Stanford's Brian Wandell claims that subliminal persuasion theories are "bizarre" and "implausible."<ref name="Holguin" />

== Deliberate backmasking ==
{{seealso|List of backmasked messages}}

Many musicians have deliberately recorded backward messages into their songs. Their purposes include avoiding censorship, making artistic or social statements, and having fun at the expense of their critics. Some bands have, indeed, advocated [[Satanism]] or violence using backmasking. Unlike unintentional, alleged backward messages, which result from playing normal lyrics backward, deliberate backward messages are usually unintelligible noise when played forward.

=== Early backmasking ===
Backmasking was used by [[Frank Zappa]] in his earliest albums to avoid censorship. ''[[We're only in it for the Money]]'' ([[1968 in music|1968]]) contains the backmasked message "Better look around before you say you don't care/Shut your f***ing<!-- please don't change this to "fucking" - the song is itself censored --> [censored in the original] mouth 'bout the length of my hair/how would you survive/if you were alive/shitty little person?" at the end of side A. This profanity laced verse of the song "Mother People" was not permitted by the record publisher, so Zappa edited the verse out (as well as the word "fucking", ironically), reversed it, and inserted it elsewhere in the album as a "song" called "Hot Poop."

=== Satanic messages ===
{{POV-section}}
{{OR}}
In contrast to the controversial alleged Satanic messages, certain backmasked messages are clearly deliberately Satanic or violent. [[Slayer]]'s [[1985 in music|1985]] album ''[[Hell Awaits]]'' begins with a demonic-sounding voice that, when played backwards, urges "Join Us" over and over at increasing volumes<ref>{{cite web|title=Did You Know?|url=http://www.slayerized.com/band/didyouknow.html|accessdate=2006-06-11}}</ref>. The [[Cradle of Filth]] song "Dinner at Deviants Palace" consists almost entirely of ambient sounds and a reversed reading of the [[Lord's Prayer]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Jeff Milner dot Com: 09/01/2004 - 09/30/2004|last=Milner|first=Jeff|url=http://jeffmilner.com/index.php/2004/09/01/more-backmasking-songs/|accessdate=2006-06-20}}</ref> (backwards readings of the Lord's Prayer are used in certain demonic rites<ref>http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/dvera/bgoat/rituals/LPBackwards.html</ref><ref>http://americanhistory.suite101.com/article.cfm/are_you_a_witch_</ref>). 

[[Black metal]] band [[Darkthrone]]'s ''[[Transilvanian Hunger]]'' album contains a message that is not necessarily Satanic, but simply [[anti-Christian]]. The track "As Flittermice As Satan's Spies" contains, when listened to backwards, "In the name of God, let the churches burn".<ref>{{cite web|title=Darkthrone Biography/Discography|url=http://www.angelfire.com/zine2/cosmicmetal/darkthrone.html|accessdate=2007-02-02}}</ref>

=== Political and social statements ===
Backwards messages have also been used as statements. On [[Roger Waters]]' [[1991]] album ''[[Amused to Death]]'', he deliberately recorded a backward message critical of film director [[Stanley Kubrick]], who had refused to let Waters sample a breathing sound from ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. It's located on the third track, "Perfect Sense Part 1". He says, "Julia, however, in light and visions of the issues of Stanley, we have changed our minds. We have decided to include a backward message, Stanley, for you and all the other book burners."

[[Image:Sox Satanic Subliminals.png|thumb|right|200px|The manual for the popular sound program [[SoX]] pokes fun at subliminal messages. The description of the "reverse" option says "Included for finding satanic subliminals."]]

On Pink Floyd's rock epic ''[[The Wall]]'' there is an intentional backwards message halfway through the track "[[Empty Spaces]]": "Hello, hunter(s)...congratulations. You've just discovered the secret message. Please send your answer to Old Pink, care of the funny farm, Chalfont...Roger! Carolyn's on the phone! Okay." It is believed that this backward message is a comical reference to former lead singer/guitarist Syd Barrett. Roger Waters congratulates you for finding this message, and jokes that you can send your answer to Syd (the 'Old Pink'), who lives somewhere in Chalfont (the 'funny farm' in Chalfont). Before he can tell the exact location however, he gets interrupted by someone in the background who says Carolyn (Waters' real life wife) is on the phone.

Many backwards messages are parodies, poking fun at the controversy (see [[List of backward messages#Parody messages|Parody messages]]). A few [[Christian rock]] musicians in the 1980s included deliberate backmasking with a [[gospel]] message as a lighthearted way of poking fun at the concern over backmasking&mdash;concern which was often being promoted by the same fundamentalist evangelists who were also attacking Christian rock. The Christian rock group [[Petra (band)|Petra]], in their song "Judas Kiss," included the message "What are you looking for the devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?" Another Christian rock musician, [[Randy Stonehill]], included the backward message "He shall reign forever" in his song "Rainbow." The Christian heavy metal band Stryken (not to be confused with [[Stryper]]) put a warning label on their album to warn listeners that the album contained numerous backward messages urging the listener to accept [[Jesus Christ]] as personal savior.

In 1981, [[Styx (band)|Styx]] was accused of putting a backwards message, believed to be either "Satan move through our voices" or "Satan moves the horses", on the song "Snowblind", from ''[[Paradise Theatre]]''. This prompted the band to create the concept album ''[[Kilroy Was Here (album)|Kilroy Was Here]]'', which deals with an allegorical group called the "Majority for Musical Morality" that outlaws rock music. A sticker on the album cover contains the message, "By order of the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward messages". One song, "Heavy Metal Poisoning", does in fact contain the backmasked [[Latin language|Latin]] words "''[[Annuit Cœptis]], [[Novus Ordo Seclorum]]''" – part of the [[Great Seal]] which encircles the pyramid on the back of the [[United States one-dollar bill|dollar bill]].<ref name="poundstone" />

Other artists have also poked fun at themselves or at critics using backmasking. On "[[Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict]]", a track from the two part [[1969 in music|1969]] [[Pink Floyd]] album ''[[Ummagumma]]'', someone says, "That was pretty [[avant-garde]], wasn't it?"

The [[electro (music)|electro]] band [[Mindless Self Indulgence]]'s 2000 album ''[[Frankenstein Girls Will Seem Strangely Sexy]]'' contains a song named ''Backmask (warning!)'' that contains the lyrics (when played forwards) "Play that record backwards/ Here's a message yo for the suckas/ Play that record backwards/ And go fuck yourself." When played backwards, the words "Clean your room/ Do your homework/ Don't stay out too late/ Eat your vegetables/ Put away your toys/ Don't sit too close to the TV/ Get dressed for church" can clearly be heard.

A famous deliberate backward message comes from the intro of an [[Electric Light Orchestra]] instrumental 'Fire on High' where this mysterious deep voice reverses to "The music is reversible, but time is not, turn back! Turn back! Turn back!"&mdash;ostensibly [[Jeff Lynne]]'s shot at backmasking hysteria after completely false satanic allegations against their song 'Eldorado' by [[Fundamentalist Christian]]s which led upto American Congressional Hearings, afterwards E.L.O. then answered with [[Secret Messages]] in [[1983]]. Another satirical message was recorded by [[Ozzy Osbourne]] in his album ''[[No Rest for the Wicked (Ozzy)|No Rest for the Wicked]]''. "Bloodbath in Paradise," when played backwards, contains "Your mother sells whelks in Hull" - apparently a parody of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', in which the possessed child screams "Your mother sucks cocks in hell." The message appears to be related to an earlier lawsuit against Ozzy related to alleged subliminal messages on his album ''[[Blizzard of Ozz]]''.

Two songs by [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] employ deliberate backmasking; only one song of the two has a particular (albeit [[tongue-in-cheek]]) demonic reference. In "Nature Trail to Hell", from the [[1984]] album ''[["Weird Al" Yankovic in 3-D]]'', Al declares that "Satan eats [[Cheez Whiz]]", a reference to the supposed messages in "[[Stairway to Heaven]]". Later, in "[[I Remember Larry]]" from the [[1996]] album ''[[Bad Hair Day]]'', Al lightly chastises the listener, remarking, "Wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands."

The album ''[[The Amazing Jeckel Brothers]]'', released by [[Insane Clown Posse]] in 2000, contains intentional backmasking. The song "Everybody Rise" contains gibberish at the end of the track, which, when played backwards, reveals itself to be [[Violent J]] saying "If you flipped this message, cuz you think there's some secret message, there ain't shit!"

In [[New Kids on the Blecch|an episode]] of [[FOX]]'s ''[[The Simpsons]]'', [[Bart Simpson]], [[Milhouse Van Houten]], [[Nelson Muntz]], and [[Ralph Wiggum]] formed a [[boy band]]. Their music videos contain military imagery and a group of [[Arabian]] belly-dancers who recite a seemingly Arab phrase: "Yvan Eht Nioj." Lisa discovered that the phrase was "Join the [[United States Navy|Navy]]" spelled backwards. Bart's band, "Party [[Posse]]", was unwittingly helping the Navy brainwash listeners into joining.<ref>{{cite web|title=Backmask Online: Comedy|url=http://www.backmaskonline.com/comedy.html|accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref> In another episode, guest star [[Paul McCartney]] tells [[Lisa]] (who had just become a vegetarian) that playing his song "Maybe I'm Amazed" backwards will reveal a recipe for a "really ripping" lentil soup. Later in the episode, the aforementioned song is played over the credits, over which some backwards speaking (including the sentence, "Oh, by the way, [[Paul is Dead|I'm still alive]]") is added.

''[[Beavis and Butt-Head Do America]]'' contains a scene where [[Beavis]] and [[Butt-Head]] hallucinate, and voices are heard in the background. The soundtrack, when played backwards, reveals that the two characters are speaking phrases such as "Everybody go to college, study hard, study hard."<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115641/trivia</ref>

In the [[Adam Sandler]] movie ''[[Little Nicky (film)|Little Nicky]]'', one character attempts to demonstrate a backwards satanic message on an [[Ozzy Osbourne]] album. At this point, the title character - one of the devil's sons, played by Sandler - says that Ozzy was always up front with his messages about the devil. Following this, he produces a [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] record and reveals that it clearly says, when played backwards: "I command you in the name of Lucifer to spread the sin of hatred across the world". In some versions the message is "I command you in the name of Lucifer, to spread the blood of the innocents."

On the FX series [[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia]], one of the production company logos after the end credits has a hidden message played backwards. When played forwards, it's two cast members saying "You're stupid for playing this forwards."

In the rock-opera episode of [[Clone High]], [[JFK (Clone High)|JFK]] falls through the cafetorium sunroof. When he lands, he begins to foam at the mouth and speak jibberish. If one plays the jibberish backwards, JFK is saying "I am talking backwards, and telling you to watch [[Clone High]]... and for us to get an [[Emmy]]... I'm saying that backwards... 'cause it's sneaky!"

The [[Red Dwarf]] episode "Backwards" contains many examples of reversed speech, most of which agree with the subtitled captions explaining them, with one notable exception.<ref>{{cite web|title=Red Dwarf: Backwards: Hidden message|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbdvbRRu6U|accessdate=2006-10-25}}</ref>

=== Artistic backmasking ===
Backmasking has also been used artistically. In the instrumental portions of "Starálfur," by [[Iceland]]ic band [[Sigur Rós]], similar sounds are hidden inside another. Heavy rock act [[Korn]] used backmasking in their interlude track "Am I Going Crazy" from their fourth album ''[[Issues (album)|Issues]]''. It is a short track, less than one minute in length, without any of the distorted guitars or heavy drumming typical of the band. When listened to backwards, the song sounds almost exactly the same as when listened to forwards, except that the words "It's the same thing" become audible when the track is played in reverse. 

While not actually backmasking, part of the [[David Bowie]] song "Move On" is his earlier song "All The Young Dudes" played backwards. Bowie stated that "I was playing through some old tapes of mine on a Revox and accidentally played one backwards and thought it was beautiful. Without listening to what it was originally we recorded it note for note backwards"<ref>http://www.5years.com/encya.htm</ref>.

The title track from [[Ultravox]]'s 1982 Album "Rage in Eden" features as a weird second refrain their song "I Remember (Death In The Afternoon)" off the same record this time played backwards. 

[[The Stone Roses]] created the song "Don't Stop" from their [[The Stone Roses (album)|self-titled]] debut-album by playing the demo of another song, "Waterfall", backwards, and then adding lyrics that they thought fit to the sound of the song. In [[Enigma (musical project)|Enigma]]'s fourth album, ''[[The Screen Behind the Mirror]]'', the song "Camera Obscura" contained sections of Andru Donalds' reversed vocals from "Modern Crusaders", an earlier track in the album. Towards the end of "Camera Obscura", a symmetric pattern emerges at the point of climax, as it reverses into the buildup of the climax, creating a chaotic atmosphere.

In 1997, the Scottish band [[Mogwai (band)|Mogwai]] released a track on their album "[[Young Team]]" called, "Yes! I Am A Long Way From Home" which contains backmasking at about 3:45 duration. The backmasking takes place at the song's standard exciting part.

In [[2002]], [[Boards of Canada]] released [[Geogaddi]], which contained a track entitled "[[Dandelion]]". The focal point of the song is a sample of [[Leslie Nielsen]]'s voice from a '70s educational video, but the music in the background is, in fact, a reversed melody. Additionally, the song "A Is To Be As B Is To C", also on Geogaddi, contains the phrase "I've been gone about a week...", which can be heard in both normal and reversed playback, thus making it a true audio palindrome.<ref>{{dlw|http://www.speakeasy.org/~adbrown/boc.html|What the hell is up with Boards of Canada?}}</ref>

[[Linkin Park]]'s "Announcement Service Public" contains a reverse recording of singer [[Chester Bennington]] screaming "You should brush your teeth and you should wash your hands!". The song "P5hng Me A*wy" from the album ''[[Reanimation]]'' also has a backmasked part that consists of two of the song's verses.

[[Tally Hall]]'s "Ruler of Everything" contains a portion of seemingly nonsensical laughter which comes out "Eh heh ho ho! Ah, he's a jackrabbit! He's a jackrabbit look at him! He's jumping around! Ah haha!" when played in reverse.‎

[[Utada Hikaru]]'s hit single "Passion" has several backmasked parts, saying "I need more affection than you know." In the english version of Passion (Sanctuary), and in the opening version of Passion, a verse which is almost completely backwards can be heard, saying "So many ups and downs" and "I need true emotions", along with "I need more affection than you know".

[[The Cure]]'s song Pornography, which focuses on death and suicide, begins with a backmasked excerpt of a BBC anchorman signing off.

[[Prince (musician)|Prince]] used backmasking on his [[Purple Rain]] album at the end of the song Darling Nikki. It says "Hello, how are you? I'm fine because I know that the lord is coming soon, coming, coming soon. Ha ha ha ha ha."

The BBC [[Radiophonic Workshop]] based the audio backing for a science fiction play on reversed voices.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/9xn8/</ref>

=== Backmasking as censorship ===
Backmasking is often used to [[censorship|censor]] words and phrases deemed as inappropriate on [[radio edit]]s and edited album releases.<ref name="Nelson">{{cite web|last=Nelson|first=Chris|title=Sticker Ban Policy: Family Values Or Consumer Fraud?|publisher=[[VH1]]|date=1998-09-08|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/501064/19980908/story.jhtml|accessdate=2007-02-03}}</ref>

This practice is most often applied in [[hip hop music|rap music]]. One particularly common example involves the word "[[shit]]" being backmasked to sound like "ish". As a result, "[[ish]]" has become a [[euphemism]] for "shit". An example of backmasking used as censorship is on the album, "[[Better Dayz]]" by [[2pac]], where all profanity, drug references, violence, and even names of certain rappers are backmasked.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

[[The Fugees]]' clean version of the album ''[[The Score (album)|The Score]]'' contains various backmasked [[profanity|swears]].<ref name="Nelson" /> Thus, when playing the album backwards, the swears are clearly audible among the backwards gibberish.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Everything2]]|title=Music that sounds better backward than forward|url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=677630&lastnode_id=0|accessdate=2006-08-26}}</ref>
