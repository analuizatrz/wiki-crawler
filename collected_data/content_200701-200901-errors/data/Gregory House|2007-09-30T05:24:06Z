==Character overview==
House is a [[wiktionary:maverick|maverick]] medical [[genius]] (often quoted as "medicine's most brilliant mind") who headed a team of young [[diagnostician]]s  at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital. The fellows in his team were [[Allison Cameron]], [[Robert Chase]], and [[Eric Foreman]], who had a rivalry with House. The rivalry began in the first episode when House admitted that he hired Foreman because of his criminal record (Foreman initially threatened to sue House). House also once calls him "Blackpoleon Blackapart", a reference to [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and his take-charge leadership abilities.

Although [[Robert Chase]] has betrayed House for his job, which escalating to tension between the two, House has said he believes Chase "loves" him.<ref name="Judas">{{cite episode | title = Finding Judas| episodelink = Finding Judas| series = House, M.D. | serieslink = House (TV series) | airdate = 2006-11-28| season = 3| number = 9}}</ref> House doesn't show attachment on his part, but helps Chase keep his job after he makes a serious medial mistake that could have led to his dismissal in "[[The Mistake (House episode)|The Mistake]]." When the team believes House is dying of inoperable brain cancer, Chase cries as he hugs House.<ref name="halfwit" /> House respects Chase's instincts and ability to use logic to figure out what's going on through his powers of observation. House admits this to himself in his dream when he was shot and later on to Chase directly when Chase figures out House canceled Foreman's interview.

[[Image:HouseRightDamagedLeg.JPG|thumb|right|200px|House's thigh, scarred from infarction surgery]]
His crankiness is commonly attributed to the chronic pain in his leg (the result of an [[infarction]] in one or more of the [[quadriceps]] muscles in his right thigh), for which he requires the aid of a cane. According to Stacy Warner, his former girlfriend, <!-- Stacy was not his wife, before changing this, please see [http://www.usanetwork.com/series/house/theshow/characterprofiles/ward/index.html] or [http://www.fox.com/house/recaps/121.htm]-->he was "pretty much the same" before the infarction. For his chronic leg pain, House takes [[Hydrocodone|Vicodin]], but also uses them when he is dealing with a case that wastes his time or annoys him. He agrees that he has an [[drug addiction|addiction]], but says that the addiction is not a problem because it does not interfere with his life.

==Biography==
Gregory House was born to John and Blythe House on [[June 11]] [[1959]].<ref name="no reason" /> His [[social security number]] was issued in [[Ohio]].<ref name="no reason">{{cite episode | title = No Reason | episodelink = No Reason (House episode)| series = House, M.D. | serieslink = House (TV series) | airdate = 2006-05-23| season = 2| number = 24}} According to his listed social security number (295-13-7865) on the hospital identification bracelet</ref><ref>This Social Security number is not valid, as the area 295 has not released SSNs with a group value of 13. [http://www.ssa.gov/employer/highgroup.txt Social Security High Values]</ref> House is a [[military brat (U.S. subculture)|"military brat"]]. His father served as a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] pilot, and transferred often to other bases during House's childhood.<ref name="daddy's boy">{{cite episode | title = Daddy's Boy| episodelink = Daddy's Boy (House episode)| series = House, M.D. | serieslink = House (TV series) | airdate = 2005-11-08| season = 2| number = 5}}</ref> House presumably picked up his affinity for languages during this period, and shows a level of understanding of [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Mandarin (linguistics)|Mandarin]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Hindi]]. One place his father was stationed was in [[Egypt]], where House developed a passing fascination with [[archaeology]] and treasure-hunting, an interest which led him to keep his treasure-hunting tools well into his adulthood.<ref name="clueless">{{cite episode | title = Clueless| episodelink = Clueless (House episode)| series = House, M.D. | serieslink = House (TV series) | airdate = 2006-03-28| season = 2| number = 15}}</ref> Another station was [[Japan]], where, at age 14, House discovered his ambition to become a doctor, after witnessing a [[buraku]] doctor solve a case no other doctor could handle.<ref name="comaguy">{{cite episode | title = Son of Coma Guy| episodelink = Son of Coma Guy| series = House, M.D. | serieslink = House (TV series) | airdate = 2006-11-14| season = 3| number = 7}}</ref>

House loves his mother but hates his father, who he claims has an "insane moral compass." House avoids both his parents, and spends an entire episode dodging a night out with them. At one point, House tells a story of his parents leaving him with his grandmother whose punishments normally consisted of abuse, such as making him sleep on the lawn or taking an ice bath. He later confesses that it was his father that abused him.<ref name="oneday">{{cite episode | title = One Day, One Room| episodelink = One Day, One Room| series = House, M.D. | serieslink = House (TV series) | airdate = 2007-01-30| season = 3| number = 12}}</ref>

After receiving his [[undergraduate]] degree at [[Johns Hopkins University]], House studied at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]] until classmate Phillip Weber turned House in for copying exam answers from him.<ref name="distractions">{{cite episode | title = Distractions| episodelink = Distractions (House episode)| series = House, M.D. | serieslink = House (TV series) | airdate = 2006-02-14| season = 2| number = 12}}</ref> Following his expulsion from Johns Hopkins, he applied and was accepted to the [[University of Michigan]] at [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] where he received his [[M.D.]] and met [[Lisa Cuddy]], his future boss.<ref name="humpty">{{cite episode | title = Humpty Dumpty| episodelink = Humpty Dumpty (House episode)| series = House, M.D. | serieslink = House (TV series) | airdate = 2005-09-27| season = 2| number = 3}}</ref> There is a degree of [[sexual tension]] between the two as they had a one-night stand in the past.<ref name="topsecret">{{cite episode | title = Top Secret | episodelink = Top Secret (House episode)| series = House, M.D. | serieslink = House (TV series) | airdate = 2007-03-27| season = 3 | number = 16}}
:House: Give me a break. You hired me ...
:Cuddy:... because you're a good doctor who couldn't get himself hired at a blood bank, so I got you cheap.
:House:You gave me everything I asked for because one night I gave you everything ...</ref> Cuddy tolerates most of House's many taunts and jokes often about her [[breasts]] or being pregnant, while having the wit to retort or laugh him off. Cuddy also allows House to take unconventional measures to solve a case.

[[Image:Steve McQueen.png|200 px|thumb|House's pet rat, Steve.]]
About ten years before the series began, House embarked on a relationship with Stacy, a [[constitutional law]]yer. They met at a "Doctors vs Lawyers" paintball event where she shot him. Five years later, he suffered an [[infarction]] in his right leg, which went undiagnosed for three days due to doctors' concerns that he was exhibiting drug seeking behavior. An aneurysm in his thigh had clotted, leading to an infarction and causing his [[Quadriceps femoris muscle|quadriceps]] muscles to become [[necrosis|necrotic]]. House had the dead muscle bypassed in order to restore circulation to the remainder of his leg, risking organ failure or cardiac arrest. He was willing to endure excruciating chronic pain as to retain the use of his leg. After House was put into a chemically-induced [[coma]] to sleep through the worst of the pain, Stacy decided to choose a safer surgical middle-ground between [[amputation]] and a bypass by removing just the dead muscle. This resulted in a partial loss of the use of his leg, and left House with a lesser, but still serious, level of pain for the rest of his life. House could not forgive Stacy for making the decision, so he left her.<ref name="threestories">{{cite episode | title = Three Stories| episodelink = Three Stories (House episode)| series = House, M.D. | serieslink = House (TV series) | airdate = 2005-05-17| season = 1| number = 21}}</ref> 

When Stacy makes her first appearance in the series, she is married to a high school guidance counselor named Mark Warner. Although the two grow closer together and reunite briefly during the second season, House tells Stacy to go back to her husband, which devastates her. She has not been seen in the show ever since.

[[Image:Hckiss.jpg|175 px|thumb|Cameron kisses House to try to get a blood sample.]]
A major [[subplot]] of the first season dealt with Cameron's growing attraction to House. He took Cameron on an informal date to a [[monster trucks|monster truck jam]] in the episode "[[Sports Medicine (House episode)|Sports Medicine]]." After Cameron resigns, she returns on a condition that House take her out on a date. Although House has repeatedly rejected her, he has a sexual attraction to Cameron.<ref name="halfwit">{{cite episode | title = Half-Wit | episodelink = Half-Wit (House episode)| series = House, M.D. | serieslink = House (TV series) | airdate = 2007-03-06| season = 3 | number = 15}}</ref> His hallucination showed Cameron as a "lab rat" so that he could use the robotic surgeon to caress Cameron's body and also intentionally pops off the buttons of her blouse to reveal a very lacy bra and [[cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]].<ref name="no reason" /> During his hallucination, Cameron keeps vigil by House's bedside for the two days he is unconscious.

==Personality==
[[Image:Houseteam.JPG|thumb|left|From left to right: [[Dr. Allison Cameron]], Dr. Gregory House, and [[Eric Foreman|Dr. Eric Foreman]].]]
He frequently shows his cunning and biting wit, and enjoys picking people apart and mocking their weaknesses.<ref name="Contempt"/> House typically waits as long as possible before meeting his patients, as he usually finds himself annoyed by them. When he finally does encounter his patients, usually to do something his team cannot, House confounds patients with an eccentric [[bedside manner]] and often unorthodox treatments, but impresses them with rapid and accurate diagnoses after seemingly not paying attention, once diagnosing an entire waiting room full of patients on his way out of the hospital clinic. <ref name="sports">{{cite episode | title = Sports Medicine| episodelink = Sports Medicine (House episode)| series = House, M.D. | serieslink = House (TV series) | airdate = 2005-02-22| season = 1| number = 12}}</ref>

House frequently says "Everybody lies," but jokingly remarked that he was [[liar paradox|lying when he said that]] in the first season finale. House criticizes social etiquette for its uselessness and apparent lack of rational purpose. In one episode, he explains how he envies an autistic patient because society allows the patient to forgo the niceties that he must suffer through.  

Like the character's inspiration, [[Sherlock Holmes]] (see below), House accurately deciphers people's motives and histories from aspects of their personality and appearance. [[Dr. James Wilson]] once states in the episode "[[DNR (House episode)|DNR]]" that while "some doctors have the [[messiah complex]] &mdash; they need to save the world", House has "a [[Rubik's Cube|Rubik's]] complex" &mdash; he needs "to solve the puzzle."

[[Image:House and Wilson.jpg|thumb|Another one of House's greatest pleasures is poking fun at Dr. Wilson's personal life.]]
House possesses a strong non-conformist or [[anarchism|anarchistic]] streak. Throughout the series, he displays sardonic contempt for authority figures, from senior doctors, politicians, and businessmen to nuns and [[God]]. House shows an almost constant disregard for his own appearance, dressing informally&mdash;often in jeans&mdash;and without the standard white lab coat, and possessing a permanent stubble.

House's only friend is Dr. James Wilson and has little social life. Wilson has known House before the infarction, and looked after House when House's relationship with Stacy ended.<ref name="needtoknow">{{cite episode | title = Need to Know| episodelink = Need to Know (House episode)| series = House, M.D. | serieslink = House (TV series) | airdate = 2006-02-07| season = 2| number = 11}}</ref> Wilson moves into House's apartment after a failed relationship in "[[Sex Kills]]" to take emotional refuge in his friend.<ref>[http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2006/05/houseapalooze_p.html 'House'-a-palooze, Part 3: Katie Jacobs]</ref> Although they frequently analyze and criticize each other's motives, Wilson has risked his career to protect House. House has quietly admitted, at several instances, that he is grateful for Wilson's presence, referring to Wilson as his best friend.

==Casting==
When Hugh Laurie was auditioning for the role of Gregory House, he was filming ''[[Flight of the Phoenix (2004 film)|Flight of the Phoenix]]''. After watching the casting tapes for the [[pilot episode]], [[Bryan Singer]] grew frustrated and refused to cast a British actor with a flawed American accent for the role of Gregory House.<ref name="badmood">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101308,00.html Doctor Is in ... a Bad Mood]</ref> However, when he saw Hugh Laurie's audition tape, Singer was fooled by Laurie's American accent. He mistook him as an American and praised Laurie as an example of a true American actor.<ref>''[[Radio Times]]'' magazine, [[23 March]] [[2007]]</ref> Laurie initially believed that James Wilson would be the protagonist of the show after reading the brief description of the character and did not find out that House was the main character until he read the full script of the pilot episode.<ref name="Inside"> ''Inside the Actor's Studio'' Hugh Laurie Interview, BRAVO Network, [2006]</ref> Prior to the airing of the series, the producers were also concerned that Laurie lacked [[sex appeal]] to the viewers.<ref name="badmood" />

==Concept and creation==
Hugh Laurie describes House as a character "who didn't obey the usual pieties of modern life."<ref name="badmood" /> As a [[protagonist]], many aspects of his personality are the antithesis of what might be expected from a [[Physician|doctor]].<ref name="Contempt">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,995688,00.html Scorn Is the Best Medicine]</ref> Actor [[Robert Sean Leonard]] has said that House and his character was originally intended to play the role of Sherlock Holmes and [[Dr. Watson]] in the series although he believes that House's team has assumed the role.<ref name="messed up">[http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2006/05/house_isnt_wait.html 'House'-a-palooza: On Omar Epps' Emmy bid, Wilson's messed-up life and stupid cane tricks]</ref> Producer [[Katie Jacobs]] has said both characters avoid mature relationships, which brings the two closer together.<ref name="messed up" /> He is one of the few who voluntarily maintains a relationship with House, and one of the few individuals who can make House laugh.<ref name="messed up" />

==Parallels with Sherlock Holmes==
Series creator [[David Shore]] has said that House's character is partly inspired by [[Sherlock Holmes]].<ref name="Holmes" /> The name "House" is a play on "Holmes" (with English pronunciation, a [[homophone]] for "homes").<ref>http://msnbc.msn.com/id/7518037</ref><ref>http://8763wonderland.com/2006/01/16/hugh-laurie-wins/</ref>

Both Holmes and House are experts who are brought into cases that have proven too difficult for other investigators. Both characters exhibit remarkable powers of observation and deduction, a tendency to come to rapid conclusions after the briefest examination of the circumstances, [[drug use]] ([[cocaine]] for Holmes, [[Hydrocodone|Vicodin]] for House), talent with a musical instrument ([[violin]] for Holmes, [[piano]] and [[guitar]] for House), and only one real friend ([[Dr. Watson]] and [[Dr. James Wilson|Dr. Wilson]], respectively), who connects the detached hero to human concerns. Also, just like Watson, at one point Wilson is roommates with House. Watson and Wilson are both attributed to be "ladies' men."

While House consumes large quantities of Vicodin for different reasons, Holmes took cocaine intravenously when bored, and experiment with different drugs in an experimental, often research-driven modality. House uses LSD to treat a self-induced [[migraine]], and later attempts to obtain experimental surgery to supplement his brain's pleasure center in "[[Half-Wit (House episode)|Half-Wit]]".<ref name="distractions"/>

The patient in the series' pilot episode is named Rebecca Adler, whereas Holmes is outwitted by [[Irene Adler]] in his first short story, "[[A Scandal in Bohemia]]." The man who shoots House in the episode "[[No Reason (House episode)|No Reason]]" has the surname Moriarty, echoing Holmes' nemesis [[Professor Moriarty]]. On at least one occasion (at the end of [[Human Error (House episode)|Human Error]]), House's apartment number is revealed to be 221, while his particular apartment is B, a play on Sherlock Holmes' [[221B Baker Street]] address. In the episode "[[Whac-A-Mole (House episode)|Whac-A-Mole]]", House challenges his team to a game, and places what he says is the right answer in an envelope on which was written "The game is a <!--note: it's not a typo; it was written "a itchy foot", because it's a play on the word "afoot"--> itchy foot," which is a play on "The game is afoot," a quote often attributed to Holmes (who was in turn quoting [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] (Henry V)).
