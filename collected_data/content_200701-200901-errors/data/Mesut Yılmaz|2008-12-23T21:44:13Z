'''Ahmet Mesut Yılmaz''' (born [[6 November]] [[1947]] in [[Istanbul]]) is the former leader of the [[Motherland Party (Turkey)|Motherland Party]] ({{lang-tr|Anavatan Partisi}}, ANAP) and was the Turkish [[List of Prime Ministers of Turkey|prime minister]] in the 1990s.  

Mesut Yılmaz was a rising star in the Motherland Party of [[Turgut Özal]], representing the [[Black Sea]] province of [[Rize]] in the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|parliament]] and serving as tourism minister in Ozal's cabinet.  Upon Özal's election to the presidency in 1989, Yılmaz became the leader of an intraparty opposition to the new Prime Minister, [[Yıldırım Akbulut]].  

Yılmaz managed to discharge [[Yıldırım Akbulut|Akbulut]] from party leadership and from all executive functions during the [[wiktionary:Biennial|biennial]] party congress in June 1991. Because ANAP had the majority in the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|parliament]] he subsequently became [[List of Prime Ministers of Turkey|Prime Minister of Turkey]].

The following years saw a decline in the popularity of the Motherland Party and an acrimonious relationship with [[Tansu Çiller]], leader of the center-right [[True Path Party]] (DYP). Yılmaz also made the Motherland Party more business-friendly and [[Europe]]-oriented, causing the more conservative, religious wing to switch to the [[Refah Partisi]], or Welfare Party, of [[Necmettin Erbakan]]. 

His term was marked by the [[Susurluk scandal]], during which he admitted the existence of the [[JITEM]] counter-terrorist Gendarmerie unit.<ref name=HRFT>[http://www.tihv.org.tr/EN/data/Yayinlar/Human_Rights_Reports/Ra1998HumanRigthsReport.pdf 1998 Report] from the [[Human Rights Foundation of Turkey]] (HRFT), chapter II, "SUSURLUK SCANDAL: Counter-guerilla Affairs", p.39-86 (see p.46)</ref> The scandal led to the resignation of his [[Interior Minister (Turkey)|Interior Minister]], [[Mehmet Ağar]] (a leader of the [[True Path Party]], DYP), following revelations that [[Abdullah Çatlı]], leader of the far-right [[Grey Wolves]] organisation, worked for the state.<ref name=HRFT/> Yılmaz' concerns over his own safety, owing to his support of the Susurluk investigation, led to his briefly carrying a gun in self-defense.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/haber.aspx?id=-2927&yazarid=10

'Güneş hediye etti' dedikten sonra tabancayı uzattı.
Avusturya malı, Glock marka bir tabanca.
Özelliği çok hafif oluşu. Mesut Bey'in çantasında ilk defa silah taşıdığını görüyorum. 
Demek ki Susurluk olayı bazı şeyleri değiştirmiş.

In October 1998, he set off a furor in the [[Arab world]] by threatening to "poke out the eyes" of [[Syria]] over [[Hafez al-Assad]]'s support of the separatist [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/191228.stm

Yılmaz's last stint as Prime Minister ended in 1999.  He continued as a politician, however, serving as a deputy prime minister in a coalition led by [[Bülent Ecevit]] from 1999 to 2002. After his failure to win entry into the Grand National Assembly in 2002 elections, Yılmaz retired from politics to pursue a teaching career. After almost 4 years, Yılmaz announced his return to politics in August 2006.

He was charged by the state public prosecutor with corruption during his tenure as prime minister. He was acquitted by the Supreme Court in 2006.

In the [[Turkish general election, 2007|2007 general election]] he was elected as independent member of parliament from Rize.
