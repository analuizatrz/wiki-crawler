The '''Robot Building''', located in the [[Sathorn]] business district of [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], houses [[United Overseas Bank]]'s Bangkok headquarters. It was designed for the [[Bank of Asia]] by [[Sumet Jumsai]] to reflect the computerization of banking; its architecture is a reaction against [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] and [[high-tech architecture|high-tech]] [[postmodern architecture]]. The building's features, such as progressively receding walls, antennae, and eyes, contribute to its [[robot|robotic]] appearance and to its practical function. Completed in 1986, the building is one of the last examples of [[modern architecture]] in Bangkok and has garnered international critical acclaim.

==Design==

Thai architect [[Sumet Jumsai]]{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} designed the Robot Building for the [[Bank of Asia]], which was acquired by [[United Overseas Bank]] in 2005.<ref name=sumet>Jumsai, Sumet.

Sumet designed the building in conscious opposition to [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]] styles of the era, particularly [[Neoclassical architecture|classical revivalism]] and [[high-tech architecture]] as embodied in the [[Centre Pompidou]].<ref name=sumet/>   While Sumet praised the inception of postmodernism as a protest against puritanical, bland modern design, he called it "a protest movement which seeks to replace without offering a replacement".<ref name=sumet/>  Sumet dismissed mid-1980s classical revivalism as "intellectual[ly] bankrupt[]" and criticized the "catalogue[s] of meaningless architectural motifs" that characterized classical revivalism in Bangkok.<ref name=sumet/> He further dismissed high-tech architecture, "which engrosses itself in the machine while at the same time secretly...lov[ing]...handmade artifacts and honest manual labor", as a movement without a future.<ref name=sumet/>

Sumet wrote that his building "need not be a robot" and that a "host of other metamorphoses" would suffice, so long as they could "free the spirit from the present intellectual impasse and propel it forward into the next century".<ref name=sumet/> He wrote that his design might be considered post-high-tech: rather than exhibiting the building's inner workings, he chose to adorn a finished product with the abstractions of mechanical parts.<ref name=sumet/> His building, he argued, struck against the 20th century vision of the machine as a "separate entity" often "elevated on a pedestal for worship" and, by becoming "a part of our daily lives, a friend, ourselves", cleared the way for the 21st century amalgam of machine and man.<ref name=sumet/> 

The building was completed in 1986 at a cost of US$10 million.<ref name=kusno>Kusno, Abidin. ''Behind the Postcolonial: Architecture, Urban Space and Political Cultures in Indonesia.''

==Characteristics==

The building is 20 stories tall and has a total floor area of 23,506&nbsp;m² (253,016&nbsp;ft²).<ref name=sumet/><ref name=williams/>  The [[Setback (architecture)|floor areas decrease progressively]] at the 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 18th floors; the staggered shape both contributes to the robot's appearance and is an efficient solution to [[Setback (architecture)#Setbacks and urban planning|setback regulations]] requiring an 18 degree incline from each side of the property line.<ref name=sumet/>  The building's ground floor is a double-height banking hall.<ref name=sumet/>  The hall's interior architecture, designed in association with the firm 7 Associates, was designed to further the robotic appearance of the building; four sculptures by Thai artist Thaveechai Nitiprabha stand at the main door.<ref name=sumet/>  [[Mezzanine (architecture)|Mezzanine]] floors located on each side of the banking hall contain offices and meeting rooms.  The building's second floor features a large multipurpose hall, offices, and training rooms, and its upper floors contain general office space.<ref name=sumet/>  An eight-story parking garage is located behind the main building.<ref name=sumet/>

The building's decorative exterior contributes its building's robotic appearance, though it often serves practical functions as well.<ref name=sumet/> Two [[antennae]] on the building's roof are used for communications and as [[lightning rod]]s.<ref name=sumet/>  On the building's upper [[facade]], in front of the main meeting and dining rooms of the top executive suites, are two 6&nbsp;m (19.7&nbsp;ft) lidded eyeballs that serve as windows.<ref name=sumet/>  The eyeballs are made of reflective glass; the lids are made of metallic [[louver]]s.<ref name=sumet/> [[Nut (hardware)|Nuts]] made of [[Glass fiber reinforced concrete|glass-reinforced concrete]] adorn the building's sides; the building's largest nuts measure 3.8&nbsp;m (12.5&nbsp;ft) in diameter and were the largest in the world at the time of their construction.<ref name=sumet/> The building's east and west walls have few apertures to shield its interior from the sun and to increase energy efficiency, and its north and south sides are tinted [[curtain wall]]s whose bright blue color was chosen because it was the symbol of the Bank of Thailand.<ref name=sumet/>

==Recognition==

The Robot Building was selected by the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]] as one of the 50 seminal buildings of the century.<ref>[http://archnet.org/library/parties/one-party.jsp?party_id=858 "Sumet Jumsai."] [[ArchNet]] digital library at archnet.com. Accessed [[November 13]], [[2007]].</ref> The building also earned Sumet an award from Chicago's [[Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design]], the first such award given to a Thai designer.<ref name=bp>"Corporate Focus: Propaganda coup in decor market; Inventions: Original designs intended to make people ask 'What is this?'"
