In [[physical science]]s, '''standard conditions for temperature and pressure''' are [[standard]] sets of conditions for experimental measurements, to allow comparisons to be made between different sets of data. The most used standards are those of the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] but are far from being universal standards. Other organizations have established a variety of alternative definitions for their standard reference conditions. The current version of IUPAC's standard is a [[temperature]] of 0&nbsp;°C (273.15&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]], 32&nbsp;°F) and an [[absolute pressure]] of 100&nbsp;[[kPa]] (14.504 [[pound-force per square inch|psi]])<ref name="IUPAC">{{cite book |author= A. D. McNaught, A. Wilkinson |title=Compendium of Chemical Terminology, The Gold Book |url=http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/S05910.pdf |edition=2nd Edition |year=1997 |publisher=Blackwell Science |isbn=0865426848 |quote=Standard conditions for gases: Temperature, 273.15&nbsp;K [...] and pressure of 10<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;pascals. IUPAC recommends that the former use of the pressure of 1 atm as standard pressure (equivalent to {{nowrap|1.01325 × 10<sup>5</sup> Pa}}) should be discontinued.}}</ref>, while NIST's version is a temperature of 20&nbsp;°C (293.15&nbsp;K, 68&nbsp;°F) and an absolute pressure of 101.325&nbsp;kPa (14.696&nbsp;psi). 

In [[industry]] and [[commerce]], standard conditions for temperature and pressure are often necessary to define the standard reference conditions to express the volumes of gases and liquids and related quantities such as the rate of [[volumetric flow]] (the volumes of gases and liquids vary significantly with temperature and pressure). However many technical publications (books, journals, advertisements for equipement and machinery) simply state "standard conditions" without specifying them, often leading to confusion and errors.

== Definitions ==
=== Past use ===

In the last five to six decades, professionals and scientists using the metric system of units defined the standard reference conditions of temperature and pressure for expressing gas volumes as being 0 °C (273.15&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]) and 101.325&nbsp;[[kPa]] (1&nbsp;[[atmosphere (unit)|atm]]).{{Fact|date=July 2008}} During those same years, the most commonly used standard reference conditions for people using the [[Imperial unit]]s or [[U.S. customary unit]]s was 60&nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|°F]] (520&nbsp;[[Rankine scale|°R]]) and 14.696&nbsp;[[pound-force per square inch|psi]] (1&nbsp;atm) because it was almost universally used by the oil and gas industries worldwide.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}  However, the above two definitions are no longer the most commonly used in either system of units.

=== Current use ===

Many different definitions of standard references conditions are currently being used by organizations all over the world. The table below lists a few of them, but there are more. Some of these organizations used other standards in the past, such as [[IUPAC]] which currently defines standard reference conditions as being 0&nbsp;°C and 100&nbsp;kPa (1&nbsp;bar) of pressure rather since 1982, in contrast to their old standard of 0&nbsp;°C and 101.325&nbsp;kPa (1&nbsp;atm).<ref name="IUPAC 2">{{cite book |author= A. D. McNaught, A. Wilkinson |title=Compendium of Chemical Terminology, The Gold Book |url=http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/S05921.pdf |edition=2nd Edition |year=1997 |publisher=Blackwell Science |isbn=0865426848 |quote=Standard pressure: Chosen value of pressure denoted by p<sup><s>o</s></sup> or p°. In 1982 IUPAC recommended the value 10<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Pa, but prior to 1982 the value 101&nbsp;325 Pa (=&nbsp;1&nbsp;atm) was usually used.}}</ref> Another example is from the oil industry. While a standard of 60&nbsp;°F and 14.696&nbsp;psi was used in the past, the current usage (particularly in North America) is predominantly of 60&nbsp;°F and 14.73&nbsp;psi. 

Natural gas companies in Europe and South America have adopted 15&nbsp;°C (59&nbsp;°F) and 101.325&nbsp;kPa (14.696&nbsp;psi) as their standard gas volume reference conditions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gassco.no/sw3138.asp |title= Concepts – Standard cubic meter (scm) |accessdate=2008-07-25 |author=[[Gassco]] |quote= Scm: The usual abbreviation for standard cubic metre – a cubic metre of gas under a standard condition, defined as an atmospheric pressure of 1.01325&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|bar]] and a temperature of 15°C.

The ''SATP'' used for presenting chemical [[thermodynamic properties]] (such as those published by the [[National Bureau of Standards]]) is standardized at 100&nbsp;kPa (1&nbsp;bar) but the temperature may vary and usually needs to be specified separately if complete information is desired (see [[standard state]]). Some standards are specified at certain [[relative humidity|humidity level]].

== International Standard Atmosphere ==

In [[aeronautics]] and [[fluid dynamics]] the term "[[International Standard Atmosphere]]" is often used to denote the variation of the principal [[thermodynamic]] variables (pressure, temperature, density, etc.) of the atmosphere ''with altitude'' at mid latitudes.

== Standard laboratory conditions ==

Due to the fact that many definitions of standard temperature and pressure differ in temperature significantly from standard laboratory temperatures (e.g., 0&nbsp;°C vs. ~25&nbsp;°C), reference is often made to "standard laboratory conditions" (a term deliberately chosen to be different from the term "standard conditions for temperature and pressure", despite its semantic near identity when interpreted literally). However, what is a "standard" laboratory temperature and pressure is inevitably culture-bound, given that different parts of the world differ in climate, altitude and the degree of use of heat/cooling in the workplace. The concept of "standard laboratory conditions" taught as part of the New South Wales high school chemistry syllabus is 25&nbsp;°C at 100&nbsp;kPa.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Gribbon|title=Excel HSC Chemistry Pocket Book Years 11-12|publisher=Pascal Press|year=2001|id=ISBN 1-74020-303-8}}</ref>

== Molar volume of a gas ==

It is equally as important to indicate the applicable reference conditions of temperature and pressure when stating the molar volume of a gas<ref>[http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Results?search_for=volume+molar Fundamental Physical Properties: Molar Volumes] ([[CODATA]] values for ideal gases as listed on a [[NIST]]  website page)</ref> as it is when  expressing a gas volume or volumetric flow rate. Stating the molar volume of a gas without indicating the reference conditions of temperature and pressure has no meaning and it can cause confusion.

The molar gas volumes can be calculated with an accuracy that is usually sufficient by using the [[universal gas law]] for ideal gases. The usual expression is:

<math>P V = nRT</math>

…which can be rearranged thus:

<math>\frac{V}{n} = \frac{RT}{P}</math>

where (in SI metric units):
{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
!align=right| ''P''

|-
!align=right|''n''

|-

or where (in customary USA units):

|-
!align=right| ''R''
|align=left|= the universal gas law constant of 10.7316 ft<sup>3</sup>·psi/(lbmol·°R)
|}

The molar volume of any ideal gas may be calculated at various standard reference conditions as shown below:

* '''V'''/'''n''' = 8.3145 × 273.15 / 101.325 = 22.414&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/kmol at 0&nbsp;°C and 101.325&nbsp;kPa 
* '''V'''/'''n''' = 8.3145 × 273.15 / 100.000 = 22.711&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/kmol at 0&nbsp;°C and 100&nbsp;kPa 
* '''V'''/'''n''' = 10.7316 × 519.67 / 14.696 = 379.48&nbsp;ft<sup>3</sup>/lbmol at 60&nbsp;°F and 14.696&nbsp;psi 
* '''V'''/'''n''' = 10.7316 × 519.67 / 14.730 = 378.61&nbsp;ft<sup>3</sup>/lbmol at 60&nbsp;°F and 14.73&nbsp;psi 

The technical literature can be confusing because many authors fail to explain whether they are using the universal gas law constant '''''R''''', which applies to any ideal gas, or whether they are using the gas law constant '''''R<sub>s</sub>''''', which only applies to a specific individual gas.  The relationship between the two constants is '''''R<sub>s</sub>''''' = '''''R / M''''',  where '''''M''''' is the molecular weight of the gas.

The [[US Standard Atmosphere]] uses 8.31432&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>·Pa/(mol·K) as the value of ''R'' for all calculations. (See [[Gas constant#US Standard Atmosphere|Gas constant]])
