'''William T. Anderson''' a.k.a "'''Bloody Bill'''" ([[1839]]&ndash;[[October 26]], [[1864]]) was a pro-[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] leader in the [[American Civil War]], known for his brutality towards [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldiers and pro-Union civilians in [[Missouri]] and [[Kansas]]. 

==Early years==

Anderson was raised in [[Randolph County, Missouri]] by his parents, William Anderson, Sr., a hat maker, and Martha (Thomason) Anderson. In 1850, his father travelled to [[California]], leaving Anderson and his two brothers, Ellis and James, to provide for the family in his absence. After William Anderson Sr. returned from California, the Anderson family moved to [[Agnes City Township, Kansas]], in 1857. 

Anderson worked for a time on a wagon train and allegedly was suspected of horse theft. He supposedly conducted several forays into Missouri, primarily to steal horses. However, these may simply be post-war tales meant to blacken his name even further. 
Anderson's father was murdered in March 1862. Most accounts claim a neighbor did it and that Anderson and his brother Jim later confronted the neighbor, killing him and another man. 
Now in trouble with the law, Anderson had to leave Kansas.

==Anderson as a guerrilla==

By the spring of 1863, if not earlier, Anderson and his brother Jim had become [[bushwhacker]]s and joined [[Quantrill's Raiders|Quantrill's Confederate guerrilla company]]. Anderson later became one of Quantrill's lieutenants.  The same year, Union authorities, frustrated by their failure to stamp out the bushwhackers, decided to arrest relatives of the leading members of Quantrill's guerrilla company. Anderson's sisters, Mary, Josephine, and Martha, were imprisoned with nine other women, all accused of assisting Confederate partisans. They were housed in a [[Kansas City, Missouri]] building which had been made structurally unsound by Union soldiers, who removed partitions and posts in an effort to make more space. On [[August 14]], the building collapsed, killing four of the women, including Josephine. Anderson's sister Mary survived, but was permanently crippled. This incident has been considered the spark for the virulent brutality that Anderson would henceforth demonstrate against Union soldiers and civilians. 

On [[March 2]],[[1863]], Anderson married Bush Smith of Sherman, [[Texas]]. They later moved to a farm in Ray County, Missouri, but Anderson continued his guerrilla activities.

==Raids on Lawrence, Kansas, and Centralia, Missouri==

Anderson participated in Quantrill's raid on [[Lawrence, Kansas]] on [[August 21]], [[1863]], which was meant to avenge the [[Sacking of Osceola]], Missouri by Kansas [[Jayhawkers]] nearly two years earlier.  About 200 civilian men and boys were reported to have been killed and many homes and buildings in Lawrence were burned to the ground. Soon afterward, Quantrill led his men on a winter retreat to Texas. There he and Anderson quarreled, and Anderson returned to Missouri in March 1864 at the head of his own guerrilla organization.

In 1864 Anderson gained notoriety for his particular savagery against Union soldiers and civilian sympathizers alike. He and his men usually shot their prisoners, and often mutilated and scalped the dead. He dictated or perhaps personally wrote letters to newspapers in [[Lexington, Missouri]], promising further violence against pro-Union civilians and threatening to take women of Union families as hostages. In one of them, he wrote: "I have chosen guerilla warfare to revenge myself for the wrongs that I could not honorably avenge otherwise. I lived in Kansas when the war commenced. Because I would not fight the people of Missouri, my native state, the Yankees sought my life but failed to get me. Revenged themselves by murdering my father, destroying all my property, murdered one of my sisters and have kept the other two in jail for 12 months. But I have fully glutted my vengeance. I have killed many, I am a guerilla. I have never belonged to the Confederate Army, nor do my men."

That year he was joined by a group of recruits who had served briefly with Archie Clement, his own lieutenant; these recruits included [[Frank James]], who had been one of Quantrill's Raiders, and the sixteen-year-old [[Jesse James (outlaw)|Jesse James]]. During this time, Anderson's men adopted the practice of dangling the bloody scalps of their victims from their horse bridles.

On [[September 27]], [[1864]], Anderson led fellow [[bushwhacker]]s in the [[Centralia Massacre (Missouri)]], looting and burning buildings and terrifying the local populace. They barricaded the tracks of the Northern Missouri Railroad, and forced a train to stop. They robbed the civilian passengers, and killed 21 Union soldiers who were returning home to Iowa and northwest Missouri on furlough. Anderson left one Union [[sergeant]] alive for a possible prisoner exchange; the rest he had stripped, shot, and scalped or otherwise mutilated.

The same day, Union Major A.V.E. Johnston of the [[39th Missouri Infantry Volunteers]] set off with his men to pursue Anderson's band. Anderson, in conjunction with other guerrilla leaders such as [[George Todd]], sent out a detachment that lured Johnston into a trap. After discharging their single-shot rifles with little effect, the Union solders retreated in a panic as the guerrillas cut them down. Those who tried to surrender were executed. Around 120 mounted infantrymen were killed in the ambush and pursuit.  Bodies of the soldiers were decapitated and mutilated by some of the guerrillas.

==Anderson's death==
During the Centralia massacre, the attention of Union commanders in Missouri was drawn south by the incursion of General [[Sterling Price]] with 12,000 men. After a costly attack on a federal garrison at Pilot Knob, Missouri, Price turned away from St. Louis and marched west, drawing Union forces south of the Missouri River. Anderson briefly consulted with Price, then returned to the north side of the river, where he faced only local Union militia forces.

Forced to confront Anderson's marauding in north Missouri, the Union headquarters gave Colonel Samuel P. Cox command of a large detachment of Missouri militiamen, with orders to find and kill the notorious bushwhacker. On [[October 26]] [[1864]], he located Anderson's men near [[Albany, Missouri]]. 

Cox used one of Anderson's favorite tactics against him. He sent out a mounted detachment to lure the guerrillas into a trap. The trick worked. Anderson led his men on a headlong charge after the retreating Union cavalrymen, straight into a firing line. He was shot twice in the head, and toppled from his horse behind the Union line. Found on Anderson's body after his death was a silken cord with fifty-three knots. It was believed that this was his way of keeping a record of his killings. Human scalps were also found on the bridle. His body was taken to [[Richmond, Missouri]] and was put on public display and photographed. His body was then dragged through the streets before being buried in an unmarked grave in Richmond's Pioneer Cemetery. His birth year was correctly put as [[1840]] on a tombstone years after his death.

One of the most disturbing aspects about the way the Bloody Bill Anderson story has been presented by historians and writers for over 140 years, has been the many contradictory accounts of both the number of gunshots and the location of gunshot wounds these writers claim killed Bloody Bill Anderson in the ambush near Orrick, Missouri on October 26th or 27th depending on which story you believe. Going back through my notes on this event, I came across over a dozen different and contradictory stories of both the number of gunshots this guerrilla was said to have taken and their location on the body. The contradictions are quite obvious and the differences are as numerous as the writers who told about these very important gunshots. If one accepts that Bloody Bill Anderson was killed in this ambush, which I don't, then it must be amply certain that only one of these reports can possibly be the true account. I will give you all just a sampling of these accounts and will leave it up to those who have written and published these opposing versions to explain their positions and give their sources.

The following article was written, on October 8, 1989, by Lorene 
Bishop who was a writer for the Brownwood Bulletin and President of 
the Brown County Historical Society. Lorene Bishop, as almost every reputable Brown County historian believed firmly that Bloody Bill Anderson lived out his life in Brown County, Texas until his death in 1927. I am posting only the portion of Bishop's book that deals with the ambush below as told by James S. Hackley: 

"... The existence of the Bill Anderson of Texas that became known to 
Missourians in 1924 when a short article about him appeared in The 
Houston Post and was copied in Missouri papers. At once Colonel 
James S. Hackley, an early settler of Mobeby Missouri present his 
knowledge of the facts preceeding the slaying. His story indicates 
that the guerrilla's body was identified by his, Hackley's mother, a 
cousin of the slain Confederate irregular... 
Four weeks later we drove to Richmond to my mother's brother. When 
my uncle came out to greet my mother, a boy ran up and said that Bill 
Anderson had been killed and his body was at Tice's gallery. 
We went to Tice's gallery. When my mother saw the blood on 
Anderson's face, and his clotted hair, she pleaded that the picture 
not be taken until she had washed his face and combed his hair. Her 
plea was refused by Captain Cox, who was present and claimed to have 
killed Anderson. 
Anderson was buried in Richmond. The bullet that ended his life 
struck him in the back of his head and came out through his 
forehead.' " 

(This account says ONE bullet "struck him in the back of the head and came out through his forehead.")

This next account is from the War of the Rebellion Records and comes from no other that Lt. Colonel S.P. Cox himself. 

"Report of Lieut. Col. Samuel P. Cox, Thirty-third Infanty Enrolled 
Missouri Militia. 
Richmond, Mo., October 27, 1864. 

DEAR SIR: We have the honor to report the result of our expedition on 
yesterday against the notorious bushwhacker, William T. Anderson and 
his forces, near Albany, in the soutwest corner of this county (Ray). 
Learning his whereabouts we struck camp on yesterday morning 
and made a forced march and came in contact with their pickets about 
a mile this side of Albany; drove them in and through Albany and into 
the woods beyond. We dismounted our men in the town, threw our 
infantry force into the woods beyond, sending a cavalry advance who 
engaged the enemy and fell back, when Anderson and his fiendish gang, 
about 300 strong, raised the Indian yell and came in full speed upon 
our lines, shooting and yelling as they came. Our lines held their 
position without a break.The notorious bushwhacker, Anderson, and one 
of his men, supposed to be Captain Rains, son of General Rains, 
charged through our lines. Anderson was killed and fell some fifty 
steps in our rear, receiving two balls in the side of the head. Rains 
made his escape and their forces retreated in full speed, being 
completely routed; our cavalry pursued them some ten miles, finding 
the road strewn with blood for miles. We hear of them scattered in 
various directions, some considerable force of them making thier way 
toward Richfield, in Clay County. We capured on Anderson private 
papers and orders from General Price that identify him beyond a doubt. 
I have the honor to report that my officers and me conducted 
themselves well and fought bravely on the field. We had 4 men 
wounded; lost none. The forces of my command consisted of a portion 
of Major Grimes, of Ray County, Fifty first Regiment Enrolled 
Missouri Militia, and a portion of the Thirty-Third Enrolled Missouri 
Militia, from Daviess and Caldwell Counties. 

Respectfully yours, 

S.P. COX 
Lieut. Col., Comdg. Thirty-third Regt. Enrolled Missouri 
Militia. 
GENERAL CRAIG 

(This one claims Anderson was hit with "two balls in the side of the head." Quite a feat of markmanship I would say.)

The next is from a message by one of the members of our Bloody Bill Anderson Mystery group, Laura Anderson Way, in which she quotes Paul Petersen. 

"The following is from the book "Quantrill of Missouri" by Paul Petersen, page 392 and 393." 

"In late October, in Ray County, Anderson saw the report that Price had been defeated and that George Todd had been killed. On October 24 he determined to punish the Federals for the Southern defeat at Westport." 

"Harrison Trow recalled that William Smith, a veteran guerrilla with four years' experience, rode next to Anderson. Trow claimed that five bullets struck Smith and three struck Anderson, and at the end of the fight, both men were dead." 

(Here Trow is quoted as saying "three (bullets) struck Anderson. Another strange fact is that, while this report claims William Smith was killed in this ambush, Smith's name appears nowhere on the monument erected to the guerrillas killed that day.)

"...Anderson went to Texas that winter, got married, and returned to 
Missouri in 1864 with a band of about 50 fighters. Anderson embarked 
on a summer of violence, leading his group on a campaign that killed 
hundreds and caused extensive damage. The climax came on September 27 
when Anderson's gang joined with several others to pillage the town 
of Centralia, Missouri. When more than 100 Union soldiers pursued 
them, the guerillas ambushed and massacred the entire detachment. 
Just a month later, Anderson's band was caught in a Union ambush 
outside of Albany, Missouri, and Anderson was killed by two bullets 
to his head. The body of the "blood-drenched savage," as he became 
known in the area, was placed on public display. Anderson kept a rope 
to record his killings, and there were 54 knots in it at the time of 
his death..."

Adult language is used on that site. 

"...After completely decimating the town, he moved his men to the 
south of town and set up an ambush for 150 Union Calvary men moving 
in after him. They killed 116 of them. They shot them through the 
head, then scalped them and thrust them with bayonets. They even 
chopped of ears and noses. 

On October 27th 1864, Anderson was ambushed by Captain S.P.Cox and 
his Union troops. He and one other man charged the line guns blazing. 
His horse was shot and he bit the dust, he was then shot in the back 
of the head 2 times. His body was taken to Richmond, Missouri where 
they decapitated his corpse and stuck his head on a telegraph pole. 
His body was then dragged through the streets and dumped in an 
unmarked grave. 

Bloody Bill was passionate, angry and ruthless ~ described by Jim 
Cummins as "The most desperate man I ever met." " 

(This one seems to be saying Anderson's horse "bit the dust" and then Anderson was executed with two shots in the back of the head.)

http://www.civilwarhistory.com/quantrill/anderson.htm 

"While leading his guerilla band near Orrick, Missouri on October 
27th 1864, Anderson was ambushed by Captain S.P.Cox and his Union 
troops. Anderson was caught completely unaware and was riddled with 
bullets then left for dead in his saddle. His loyal followers put up 
a fight to try and recover Anderson's corpse, but they were driven 
back by superior firepower. 

Anderson's body was taken to Richmond, Missouri where it was propped 
up in a chair and a pistol was placed in the dead man's hand then 
photographs were taken. A short while later, the Union troopers, full 
of loathing for the dead man, decapitated Anderson and impaled his 
head on a telegraph pole at the entrance to the town as a signature 
to all that the infamous killer was indeed dead. Anderson's torso was 
roped and tied to a horse then dragged along the streets of Richmond 
before being dumped in an unmarked grave outside of town." 

(This is just one of many accounts that claim that Bill Anderson's body was "riddled with bullets".) 

*** 

Carl W. Breihan tells the story a little different in his account from page 78 of his "Killer Legions of Quantrill", 1971, by saying the following: 

"...Anderson was the first to fall, his body caught in a crossfire and riddled as he toppled from the saddle..." 

*** 

If it weren't for the seriousness of this historical event, all of these different and contradictory accounts would be laughable. To say the least, EVERY writer who has made money selling books containing a version of this ambush story owes the American public an explanation for writing whatever tale he/she chose to tell in the book(s), regarding the way they claim Bloody Bill Anderson was killed that day. They should step forward and give their sources for this misinformation.

==Trivia==
Like other noted western figures (such as [[Jesse James (outlaw)|Jesse James]] and [[Billy the Kid]]), Anderson had his impersonators. One tale has him changing his name and running a saloon in Oklahoma. In 1924, a Brown County, Texas settler named William Columbus Anderson was interviewed by Henry C. Fuller, a staff writer for the Brownwood Banner-Bulletin.  Anderson claimed that he was the real Bloody Bill and that another guerrilla's body had been mistakenly identified as his.  W. C. lived in a big farmhouse he built at Salt Creek, near Brownwood, until his death at age eighty-seven in 1927.

In the movie [[The Outlaw Josey Wales]], the title character, played by [[Clint Eastwood]], is visited by Anderson and his men after the slaughter of his family. Wales agrees to ride north to Kansas with Anderson to "''set things right''."
