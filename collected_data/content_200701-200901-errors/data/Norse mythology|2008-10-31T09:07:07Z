'''Norse mythology''' comprises the beliefs, myths and legends of the [[Norse paganism|indigenous pre-Christian religion]] of the [[North Germanic language|Scandinavian]] peoples, including those who settled on [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Iceland]], where most of the written sources for Norse mythology were assembled. Norse mythology is the best-preserved version of the older common [[Germanic paganism]], which also includes the very closely related [[Anglo-Saxon mythology]]. Germanic mythology, in turn, developed from an earlier [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European mythology]].

Norse mythology is a collection of beliefs and stories shared by Northern [[Germanic tribes]]. It had no one set of doctrinal beliefs. The mythology was [[Oral tradition|orally transmitted]] in the form of poetry and modern knowledge about it is mainly based on the [[Edda]]s and other medieval texts written down during and after [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianization]].

Some aspects of Norse mythology passed into [[Scandinavian folklore]] and have survived to modern day. Others have recently been reinvented or reconstructed as [[Germanic Neopaganism]]. The mythology also remains as an inspiration in [[literature]] (see [[Norse mythological influences on later literature]]) as well as on stage productions and movies.

==Sources==
[[Image:The Tree of Yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|The title page of Olive Bray's English translation of the ''Poetic Edda'' depicting the tree [[Yggdrasil]] and a number of its inhabitants (1908) by W. G. Collingwood.]]
Most of the existing records on Norse mythology date from the 11th to 18th century, having gone through more than two centuries of oral preservation in what was at least officially a Christian society. At this point scholars started recording it, particularly in the ''[[Edda]]s'' and the ''[[Heimskringla]]'' by [[Snorri Sturluson]], who believed that pre-Christian deities trace real historical people. There is also the Danish ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], where the Norse gods are more strongly [[Euhemerus|Euhemerized]].
The ''[[Prose Edda|Prose or Younger Edda]]'' was written in the early 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]], who was a leading [[skald]], chieftain, and [[diplomacy|diplomat]] in [[Iceland]]. It may be thought of primarily as a handbook for aspiring skalds. It contains [[prose]] explications of traditional "[[kennings]]," or compressed metaphors found in poetry.  These prose retellings make the various tales of the Norse gods systematic and coherent. 

The ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' (also known as the ''Elder Edda'') was committed to writing about 50 years after the ''Prose Edda.'' It contains 29 long poems, of which 11 deal with the Germanic deities, the rest with legendary heroes like [[Sigurd the Volsung]] (the [[Sigurd|Siegfried]] of the German version ''[[Nibelungenlied]]''). Although scholars think it was transcribed later than the other Edda, the language and poetic forms involved in the tales appear to have been composed centuries earlier than their transcription.

Besides these sources, there are surviving legends in Scandinavian folklore. Some of these can be corroborated with legends appearing in other Germanic literatures e.g. the tale related in the [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''[[Finnsburg Fragment|Battle of Finnsburgh]]'' and the many allusions to mythological tales in ''[[Deor]]''. When several partial references and tellings survive, scholars can deduce the underlying tale. Additionally, there are hundreds of place names in Scandinavia named after the gods.

A few runic inscriptions, such as the [[Rök Runestone]] and the [[Kvinneby amulet]], make references to the mythology. There are also several [[runestone]]s and [[image stone]]s that depict scenes from Norse mythology, such as [[Thor]]'s fishing trip, [[Sigurd stones|scenes depicting Sigurd (Sigfried) the dragon slayer]], [[Odin]] and [[Sleipnir]], Odin being devoured by Fenrir, and one of the surviving stones from the [[Hunnestad Monument]] appears to show [[Hyrrokkin]] riding to [[Baldr]]'s funeral ([http://web.telia.com/~u85906673/asar/hyrrok.html DR 284]).

In Denmark, one image stone depicts [[Loki]] with curled dandy-like mustaches and lips that are sewn together and the British [[Gosforth cross]] shows several mythological images. There are also smaller images, such as figurines depicting the god Odin (with one eye), Thor (with his hammer) and [[Freyr]] (with his enormous erect phallus).

==Cosmology==
[[Image:The Wolves Pursuing Sol and Mani.jpg|thumb|right|"The Wolves Pursuing [[Sól (Sun)|Sol]] and [[Máni|Mani]]" (1909) by J. C. Dollman.]]
{{main|Norse cosmology}}
In Norse mythology there are '[[nine worlds]]' (''níu heimar''), that many scholars summarize as follows:
*[[Ásgard]], world of the [[Aesir]].
*[[Vanaheimr]], world of the [[Vanir]].
*[[Midgard]], world of humans.
*[[Muspellheim]], world of the primordial element of fire.
*[[Niflheimr]], world of the primordial element of ice
*[[Svartálfaheim]], world of the Svartálfar ([[black elves]]).
*[[Álfheimr]], world of the Álfar ([[elves]]).
*[[Svartalfheim]] or [[Nidavellir]], world of the Dvergar ([[Norse dwarves]]).
*[[Jötunheimr]], world of the [[Jötunn|jötnar]] (giants).

Note the boundaries between Niflheim, Jötunheimr, Hel, Niðavellir, Svartálfaheimr, and several other significant places like Utgarðr remain uncertain.

Each world also had significant places within. [[Valhalla]] is Odin's hall located in Asgard. It was also home of the [[Einherjar]], who were the souls of the greatest warriors. These warriors were selected by the [[Valkyries]], [[Odin]]'s mounted female messengers. The Einherjar would help defend the gods during [[Ragnarok]]. [[Niflhel]] is a hellish place(the underworld) ruled by Hel. 

These worlds are connected by [[Yggdrasil]], the world tree, a giant tree with Asgard at its top. Chewing at its roots in Niflheim is [[Nidhogg]], a ferocious [[serpent]] or [[dragon]]. Asgard can also be reached by [[Bifrost]], a rainbow bridge guarded by [[Heimdall]], a god who can see and hear a thousand miles.

===Supernatural beings===
[[Image:Idun and the Apples.jpg|thumb|"[[Iðunn|Idun]] and the Apples" ([[1890]]) by J. Doyle Penrose.]]
There are several "clans" of [[Vættir]] or animistic nature spirits: the [[Æsir]] and [[Vanir]], understood as gods, plus the [[Jötunn|Jötnar]], the [[light elves|Álfar]] and [[Norse dwarves|Dvergar]]. To this list can be added the dead in the Underworld. The distinction between Æsir and Vanir is relative, for the two are said to have made peace, exchanged hostages, intermarried and reigned together after the events of the [[Æsir-Vanir War]], and afterward the gods are generally referred to collectively as Æsir. 

In addition, there are many other beings: [[Fenrir]] the gigantic [[wolf]], and [[Jörmungandr]] the sea-serpent (or "worm") that is coiled around Midgard. These two monsters are described as the progeny of [[Loki]], Odin's evil blood brother. Other creatures include [[Hugin and Munin]] (thought and memory, respectively), the two ravens who keep Odin, the chief god, apprised of what is happening on earth, since he gave his eye to the [[Well of Mimir]] in his quest for wisdom, [[Sleipnir]], Loki's eight legged horse son belonging to Odin and [[Ratatosk]], the squirrel which scampers in the branches of Yggdrasil.

===''Völuspá''===
In the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Völuspá]]'' ("Prophecy [''spá''] of the [[völva]]"), Odin, the chief god of the Norse pantheon, has conjured up the spirit of a dead völva and commanded this spirit to reveal the past and the future. She is reluctant: "What do you ask of me? Why tempt me?"; but since she is already dead, she shows no fear of Odin, and continually taunts him: "Well, would you know more?"  But Odin insists: if he is to fulfill his function as king of the gods, he must possess all knowledge. Once the völva has revealed the secrets of past and future, she falls back into oblivion: "I sink now".

====Creation====
[[Image:Faroe stamp 430 The First Human Beings.jpg|thumb|upright|Ask and Embla as depicted on a Faroe Islands postage stamp (2003) by [[Anker Eli Petersen]].]]
According to Norse myth, the beginning of life was fire and ice, with the existence of only two worlds: Muspelheim and Niflheim. When the warm air of Muspelheim hit the cold ice of Niflheim, the jötunn [[Ymir]] and the icy cow [[Audhumla]] were created. Ymir's foot bred a son and a man and a woman emerged from his armpits, making Ymir the progenitor of the [[Jotun]]. Whilst Ymir slept, the intense heat from Muspelheim made him sweat, and he sweated out [[Surtr]], a jötunn of fire. Later Ymir woke and drank Audhumbla's milk. Whilst he drank, the cow Audhumbla licked on a salt stone. On the first day after this a man's hair appeared on the stone, on the second day a head and on the third day an entire man emerged from the stone. His name was [[Búri]] and with an unknown jötunn female he fathered Bor, the father of the three gods [[Odin]], [[Vili]] and [[Ve]].

When the gods felt strong enough they killed Thanny. His [[Thanny's blood|blood]] flooded the world and drowned all of the jötunn, except two. But jötnar grew again in numbers and soon there were as many as before Thanny's death. Then the gods created seven more worlds using Ymir's flesh for dirt, his blood for the Oceans, rivers and lakes, his bones for stone, his brain as the clouds, his skull for the heaven. Sparks from Muspelheim flew up and became stars.   

One day when the gods were walking they found two tree trunks. They transformed them into the shape of humans. Odin gave them life, Vili gave them mind and Ve gave them the ability to hear, see, and speak. The gods named them [[Ask and Embla]] and built the kingdom of Middle-earth for them and to keep the jötnar out the gods placed a gigantic fence made of Ymir's eyelashes around Middle-earth.

The völva goes on to describe [[Yggdrasil]] and the [[norn]]s, the three female beings who spun the fate of all life in Midgard.  She then describes the war between the Æsir and Vanir and the murder of [[Baldr]], god of light, Odin's handsome son whom everyone but Loki loved. (The story is that everything in existence promised not to hurt him except mistletoe. Taking advantage of this weakness, Loki made a projectile of [[mistletoe]] and tricked [[Höðr]], Odin's blind son and Baldr's brother, into using it to kill Baldr. [[Hel]] said she would revive him if everyone in the nine worlds wept. A female jötunn - [[Thokk]], who was Loki in shape-shifted form - did not weep.) After that she turns her attention to the future.

====Ragnarök====
{{main|Ragnarök}}
Ragnarök refers to a series of major events, including a great battle foretold to ultimately result in the death of a number of major figures (including the [[Æsir|gods]] [[Odin]], [[Thor]], [[Freyr]], [[Heimdall]], and the [[jötunn]] [[Loki]]), the occurrence of various natural disasters, and the subsequent submersion of the world in water. Afterwards, the world resurfaces anew and fertile, the surviving gods meet, and the world is repopulated by two human survivors.

==Kings and heroes==
{{main|Legendary sagas}}
[[Image:Sigurd.svg|thumbnail|250px|The [[Ramsund carving]] depicting passages from the [[Völsunga saga]]]]
The mythological literature relates the legends of heroes and kings, as well as supernatural creatures. These clan and kingdom founding figures possessed great importance as illustrations of proper action or national origins. The heroic literature may have fulfilled the same function as the [[national epic]] in other European literatures, or it may have been more nearly related to tribal identity. Many of the legendary figures probably existed, and generations of Scandinavian scholars have tried to extract history from myth in the [[Norse saga|sagas]].

Sometimes the same hero resurfaces in several forms depending on which part of the Germanic world the epics survived such as [[Weyland]]/[[Völund]] and [[Siegfried]]/[[Sigurd]], and probably [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]]/[[Bödvar Bjarki]]. Other notable heroes are [[Hagbard]], [[Starkad]], [[Ragnar Lodbrok]], [[Sigurd Ring]], [[Ivar Vidfamne]] and [[Harald Hildetand]]. Notable are also the [[shieldmaiden]]s who were ordinary women who had chosen the path of the warrior.  These women function both as heroines and as obstacles to the heroic journey.

==Norse worship==
{{main|Norse paganism|Blót}}
===Centres of faith===
[[Image:Gamla uppsala.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Gamla Uppsala]], the centre of worship in Sweden until the temple was destroyed in the late 11th century.]]
The Germanic tribes rarely or never had temples in a modern sense. The Blót, the form of worship practiced by the ancient Germanic and Scandinavian people, resembled that of the [[Celtic mythology|Celts]] and [[Balts]]. It occurred either in [[sacred grove]]s, at home, or at a simple altar of piled stones known as a "[[horgr]]". However, there seem to have been a few more important centres, such as [[Kaupang|Skiringssal]], [[Lejre]] and [[Gamla Uppsala|Uppsala]]. [[Adam of Bremen]] claims that there was a temple in Uppsala (see [[Temple at Uppsala]]) with three wooden statues of Thor, Odin, Idoki and Freyr.

===Priests===
While a kind of priesthood seems to have existed, it never took on the professional and semi-hereditary character of the Celtic [[Druidry|druid]]ical class. This was because the [[shamanistic]] tradition was maintained by women, the [[Völva]]s. It is often said that the [[Germanic king]]ship evolved out of a priestly office. This priestly role of the king was in line with the general role of [[godi]], who was the head of a kindred group of families (for this social structure, see [[norse clans]]), and who administered the sacrifices{{Fact|date=July 2008}}.

Despite the [[Shamanism|shamanistic]] [[Völva]]s, this religion was not a form of [[shamanism]]<ref>** Fleck, Jere (1971). ''The Knowledge-Criterion in the Grímnismál: the Case Against Shamanism''. Arkiv för Nordisk Filologi 86:49–65. </ref>.

===Human sacrifice===
[[Image:Midvinterblot.jpg|right|250px|thumb|"[[Midvinterblot]]" (1915) by [[Carl Larsson]].]]
A unique eye-witness account of Germanic [[human sacrifice]] survives in [[Ibn Fadlan]]'s account of a [[Rus' (people)|Rus]] [[ship burial]], where a slave-girl had volunteered to accompany her lord to the next world. More indirect accounts are given by [[Tacitus]], [[Saxo Grammaticus]] and [[Adam von Bremen]].

However, the [[Ibn Fadlan]] account is actually a burial ritual. Current understanding of Norse mythology suggests an ulterior motive to the slave-girl's 'sacrifice'. It is believed that in Norse mythology a woman who joined the corpse of a man on the funeral pyre would be that man's wife in the next world. For a slave girl to become the wife of a lord was an obvious increase in status.  Although both religions are of the Indo-European tradition, the sacrifice described in the [[Ibn Fadlan]] account is not to be confused with the practice of [[Sati (practice)|Sati]].

The ''Heimskringla'' tells of Swedish King [[Aun]] who sacrificed nine of his sons in an effort to prolong his life until his subjects stopped him from killing his last son [[Egil]]. According to Adam of Bremen, the Swedish kings sacrificed male slaves every ninth year during the [[Yule]] sacrifices at the Temple at Uppsala. The Swedes had the right not only to elect kings but also to depose them, and both king [[Domalde]] and king [[Olof Trätälja]] are said to have been sacrificed after years of famine.

Odin was associated with death by hanging, and a possible practice of Odinic sacrifice by strangling has some archeological support in the existence of bodies such as [[Tollund Man]] that perfectly preserved by the acid of the [[Jutland]] [[peat]]bogs, into which they were cast after having been strangled. However, scholars possess no written accounts that explicitly interpret the cause of these stranglings, which could obviously have other explanations.

==Interactions with Christianity==
[[Image:Ansgar.jpg|thumb|250px|An 1830 portrayal of [[Ansgar]], a Christian missionary invited to Sweden by its king [[Björn at Hauge]] in 829.]]
{{seealso|Christianization of Scandinavia}}
An important note in interpreting this mythology is that often the closest accounts that scholars have to "pre-contact" times were written by Christians. The ''Younger Edda'' and the ''Heimskringla'' were written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century, over two hundred years after Iceland became [[Christianized]].  This results in Snorri's works carrying a large amount of [[Euhemerism#Euhemerism and the Early Christians Christian Euhemerism|Euhemerism]]{{Fact|date=July 2008}}.

Virtually all of the saga literature came out of [[Iceland]], a relatively small and remote island, and even in the climate of religious tolerance there, Snorri was guided by an essentially Christian viewpoint. The ''[[Heimskringla]]'' provides some interesting insights into this issue. Snorri introduces Odin as a mortal warlord in Asia who acquires magical powers, settles in Sweden, and becomes a [[demi-god]] following his death. Having undercut Odin's divinity, Snorri then provides the story of a pact of Swedish King [[Aun]] with Odin to prolong his life by sacrificing his sons. Later in the Heimskringla, Snorri records in detail how converts to Christianity such as [[Saint Olaf]] Haraldsson brutally converted Scandinavians to Christianity.

[[Image:Sejdmen.jpg|250px|thumb|One form of [[Execution (legal)|execution]] occurred during the Christianization of [[Norway]]. King [[Olaf Tryggvason]] had male [[völva]]s (sejdmen) tied and left on a [[skerry]] at ebb to drown in the sea. (1897 illustration by Halfdan Egedius)]]

Trying to avert civil war, the Icelandic parliament voted in Christianity, but for some years tolerated heathenry in the privacy of one's home. Sweden, on the other hand, had a series of civil wars in the 11th century, which ended with the burning of the [[Temple at Uppsala]].{{Fact|date=December 2007}} In [[England]], Christianization occurred earlier and sporadically, rarely by force. Conversion by coercion was sporadic throughout the areas where Norse gods had been worshipped. However, the conversion did not happen overnight. Christian clergy did their utmost to teach the populace that the Norse gods were demons, but their success was limited and the gods never became ''evil'' in the popular mind in most of Scandinavia.

The length of time Christianization took is illustrated by two centrally located examples of Lovön and Bergen. Archaeological studies of graves at the Swedish island of [[Lovön]] have shown that the Christianisation took 150-200 years, and this was a location close to the kings and bishops. Likewise in the bustling trading town of Bergen, many runic inscriptions have been found from the 13th century, among the [[Bryggen inscriptions]]. One of them says ''may Thor receive you, may Odin own you'', and a second one is a [[galdra]] which says ''I carve curing runes, I carve salvaging runes, once against the elves, twice against the trolls, thrice against the [[thurs]]''. The second one also mentions the dangerous [[Valkyrie]] [[Skögul]].

There are few accounts from the 14th to the 18th century, but the clergy, such as [[Olaus Magnus]] (1555) wrote about the difficulties of extinguishing the old beliefs. The story related in ''[[Þrymskviða]]'' appears to have been unusually resilient, like the romantic story of [[Hagbard and Signy]], and versions of both were recorded in the 17th century and as late as the 19th century. In the 19th and early 20th century Swedish folklorists documented what commoners believed, and what surfaced were many surviving traditions of the gods of Norse mythology. However, the traditions were by then far from the cohesive system of Snorri's accounts. Most gods had been forgotten and only the hunting Odin and the jötunn-slaying Thor figure in numerous legends. [[Freyja]] is mentioned a few times and Baldr only survives in legends about place names.

Other elements of Norse mythology survived without being perceived as such, especially concerning supernatural beings in [[Scandinavian folklore]]. Moreover, the Norse belief in destiny has been very firm until modern times. Since the Christian [[hell]] resembled the abode of the dead in Norse mythology one of the names was borrowed from the old faith, ''Helvíti'' i.e. ''Hel's punishment''. Many elements of the [[Yule]] traditions persevered, such as the Swedish tradition of slaughtering the pig at Christmas ([[Christmas ham]]), which originally was part of the sacrifice to Freyr.

The Germanic gods have left numerous traces in modern vocabulary and elements of every day western life in most [[Germanic language]] speaking countries. An example of this is some of the names of the days of the week: modelled after the names of the days of the week in [[Latin]] (named after Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn), the names for Tuesday through to Friday were replaced with Germanic equivalents of the Roman gods and the names for Monday and Sunday after the Sun and Moon. In English, Saturn was not replaced, while Saturday is named after the [[wikt:sabbath|sabbath]] in German{{Fact|date=July 2008}}.

===Viking revival===
[[Image:Freya and Heimdall by Blommer.jpg|thumbnail|"[[Heimdallr]] returns the necklace [[Brísingamen]] to [[Freyja]]" by [[Swedish people|Swedish]] painter [[Nils Blommér]].]]
{{main|Viking revival}}

Early modern editions of Old Norse literature  begins in the 16th century, e.g. ''Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus'' (Olaus Magnus, 1555) and the first edition of the
13th century ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' ([[Saxo Grammaticus]]), in 1514. The pace of publication increased during the 17th century with Latin translations of the [[Edda]] (notably Peder Resen's ''Edda Islandorum'' of 1665). The renewed interest of [[Romanticism]] in the Old North had political implications. Myths about a glorious and brave past is said to have given the Swedes the courage to retake [[Finland]], which had been lost in 1809 during the [[Finnish War|war between Sweden and Russia]]. The [[Geatish Society]], of which Geijer was a member, popularized this myth to a great extent{{Fact|date=July 2008}}.

A focus for early British enthusiasts was George Hicke, who published a ''Linguarum vett. septentrionalium thesaurus'' in 1703&ndash;5. In the 1780s, [[Denmark]] offered to cede [[Iceland]] to Britain in exchange for [[Crab Island]] ([[West Indies]]), and in the 1860s Iceland was considered as a compensation for British support of Denmark in the [[Slesvig-Holstein]] conflicts. During this time, British interest and enthusiasm for Iceland and Nordic culture grew dramatically.

===Germanic Neopaganism===
{{main|Germanic Neopaganism}}

Romanticist interest in the Old North gave rise to [[Germanic mysticism]] involving various schemes of occultist "Runology", notably following [[Guido von List]] and his ''[[Das Geheimnis der Runen]]'' (1908) in the early 20th century.

Since the 1970s, there have been revivals of the old Germanic religion as [[Germanic neopaganism]] ([[Ásatrú]]) in both [[Europe]] and the [[United States]].

===Modern popular culture===
{{main|Norse mythology in popular culture}}

Norse mythology also influenced [[Richard Wagner]]'s use of literary themes from it to compose the four operas that make up ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' (''The Ring of the Nibelung'').

Subsequently, [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s writings, especially ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', were heavily influenced by the indigenous beliefs of the pre-Christian Northern Europeans. As the related Tolkien's novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' became popular, elements of its fantasy world moved steadily into popular perceptions of the fantasy genre. In many fantasy novels today can be found such Norse creatures as elves, dwarves, and frost jötnar, though this has back-fired with many viewing these creatures as clichés.{{Fact|date=July 2008}} Subsequently, Norse mythology has also greatly influenced popular culture, in literature and modern fiction. (See Marvel Comics' ''[[The Mighty Thor]]'' or Neil Gaiman's ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)]]'')
