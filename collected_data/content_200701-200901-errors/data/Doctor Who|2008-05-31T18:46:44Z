'''''Doctor Who''''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] programme produced by the [[BBC]]. The programme depicts the adventures of a mysterious alien [[time travel|time-traveller]] known as "[[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]" who travels in his space and time-ship, the [[TARDIS]], which appears from the exterior to be a blue [[police box]]. With his [[companion (Doctor Who)|companions]], he explores time and space, solving problems and righting wrongs. 

The programme is listed in ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the longest-running science fiction television show in the world<ref>{{cite news

In Britain and elsewhere, the show has become a [[Cult following|cult television]] favourite and has influenced generations of British television professionals, many of whom grew up watching the series. It has received [[#Awards|recognition]] from critics and the public as one of the finest British television programmes, including the [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA Award]] for [[British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series|Best Drama Series]] in 2006.

The programme originally ran from 1963 to 1989. A [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|television film]] was made in 1996 as a [[backdoor pilot]] for a new series (which never entered production), and the programme was successfully [[History of Doctor Who#The 2000s|relaunched]] in 2005, produced [[in-house]] by [[BBC Wales]]. Some development money for the new series is contributed by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC), which is credited as a co-producer. ''Doctor Who'' has also spawned [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-offs]] in multiple media, including the current television programmes ''[[Torchwood]]'' and ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]''.

The show's lead character is currently portrayed by [[David Tennant]]. A [[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Christmas special]] co-starring [[Kylie Minogue]] aired in December 2007, and the [[Doctor Who (series 4)|fourth series]] started on [[5 April]] [[2008]].<ref name="Series4">{{cite web|

==History==
{{main|History of Doctor Who}}
''Doctor Who'' first appeared on BBC television at 5:15 pm([[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]]) on [[23 November]] [[1963]],<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), p. 54 </ref> following discussions and plans that had been in progress for a year. The [[BBC television drama|Head of Drama]], [[Sydney Newman]], was mainly responsible for developing it, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the Head of the Script Department (later Head of Serials) [[Donald Wilson (writer and producer)|Donald Wilson]] and staff writer [[C. E. Webber]]. Writer [[Anthony Coburn]], [[script editor|story editor]] [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]] and initial [[Television producer|producer]] [[Verity Lambert]] also heavily contributed to the development of the series.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), pp. 157&ndash;230 ("Production Diary")</ref><ref>Newman is often given sole creator credit for the series. Some reference works such as ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Television Programs 1947–1979'' by Vincent Terrace erroneously credit Terry Nation with creating ''Doctor Who'', due to the way his name is credited in the two Peter Cushing films.</ref><ref>Newman and Lambert's role in originating the series was recognised in the 2007 episode "[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]", in which the Doctor, in disguise as a human named John Smith, gives his parents' names as Sydney and Verity.</ref> The series' title theme was composed by [[Ron Grainer]] and realised by [[Delia Derbyshire]] of the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]].<ref>Richards, p. 23</ref>  The programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1992), p. 3</ref>
The BBC drama department's Serials division produced the programme for 26 series, broadcast on [[BBC One]]. Viewing numbers that had fallen (though comparably increased at some points), a decline in the public perception of the show and a less prominent transmission slot saw production suspended in 1989 by [[Jonathan Powell]], Controller of BBC One.<ref name="powell">{{cite web

|accessdate=2007-02-04}}</ref> Although it was for all intents and purposes [[cancellation (television)|cancelled]] (as series co-star [[Sophie Aldred]] reported in the documentary ''Doctor Who: More Than 30 Years in the TARDIS''), the BBC said the series would return.

While in-house production had ceased, the BBC was hopeful of finding an independent production company to relaunch the show.  [[Philip Segal]], a British [[expatriate]] who worked for [[Columbia Pictures]]' television arm in the [[United States]], approached the BBC about such a venture. Segal's negotiations eventually led to a [[television movie]]. [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|The ''Doctor Who'' television movie]] was broadcast on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] in 1996 as a co-production between Fox, [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], the BBC, and [[BBC Worldwide]]. Although the film was successful in the UK (with 9.1 million viewers), it was less so in the United States and did not lead to a series. 

[[Doctor Who spin-offs|Licensed]] media such as novels and audio plays provided new stories, but as a television programme ''Doctor Who'' remained dormant until 2003. In September of that year, [[BBC Television]] announced the in-house production of a new series after several years of unsuccessful attempts by BBC Worldwide to find backing for a feature film version. The new incarnation of the series is executively produced by writer [[Russell T Davies]] and [[BBC Wales]] Head of Drama/BBC Television Controller of Drama Commissioning [[Julie Gardner]]. It has been sold to many other countries worldwide (see [[#Viewership|Viewership]]).

The new series debuted with the episode [[Rose (Doctor Who)|"Rose"]] on BBC One on [[26 March]] [[2005]]. There have been two further series in 2006 and 2007, and Christmas Day specials in 2005, 2006 and 2007. The fourth series began on BBC One on [[5 April]] [[2008]]. There will be a rest year in 2009, with no new series, although David Tennant will star in 3 specials in that year. After the 2008 Christmas special and three bank holiday specials in 2009, a fifth full-length series is planned for 2010,<ref>{{cite news

While the 2005-present version of ''Doctor Who'' is considered a direct continuation of the 1963-89 series, the 1996 telefilm is also considered part of the overall continuity. This differs from other series relaunches that have either been reimaginings or reboots (e.g., ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' and ''[[Bionic Woman (2007 TV series)|Bionic Woman]]'') or series taking place in the same universe as the original but with a totally new cast of characters (e.g., ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and spin-offs).<ref>[http://www.gallifreyone.com/newseriesfaq.php Outpost Gallifrey: TV Series FAQ<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

With popularity came controversy over the show's suitability for children. Moral campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] repeatedly complained to the BBC in the 1970s over what she saw as the show's frightening or gory content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0925766/bio|title=Biography of Mary Whitehouse|accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> The programme became even more popular - especially with children. [[John Nathan-Turner]], who produced the series during the 1980s, was heard to say that he looked forward to Whitehouse's comments, as the show's ratings would increase soon after she had made them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/new_media/1965981.stm|title=Doctor Who Producer Dies|accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> During the 1970s, the ''[[Radio Times]]'', the BBC's [[listings magazine]], announced that a child's mother said the theme music terrified her son. The ''Radio Times'' was apologetic, but the theme music remained.

There were more complaints about the programme's content than its music. During [[Jon Pertwee]]'s [[List of Doctor Who serials#Season 8 (1971)|second season]] as the Doctor, in the serial "[[Terror of the Autons]]" (1971), images of murderous plastic dolls, daffodils killing unsuspecting victims and blank-featured android policemen marked the apex of the show's ability to frighten children. Other notable moments in that decade included the Doctor's apparently being drowned by Chancellor Goth in "[[The Deadly Assassin]]" (1976) and the allegedly negative portrayal of Chinese people in "[[The Talons of Weng-Chiang]]" (1977).

It has been said that watching ''Doctor Who'' from a position of safety "[[behind the sofa]]" (as the ''Doctor Who'' exhibition at the [[Museum of the Moving Image]] in London was titled) and peering cautiously out to see if the frightening part was over is one of the great shared experiences of British childhood. The phrase has become commonly used in association with the programme and occasionally elsewhere.

[[Image:TARDIS2.jpg|thumb|The Mark II fibreglass [[TARDIS]] used between 1980 and 1989.]]
A BBC audience research survey conducted in 1972 found that by their own definition of "any act(s) which may cause physical and / or psychological injury, hurt or death to persons, animals or property, whether intentional or accidental", ''Doctor Who'' was the most violent of all the drama programmes the corporation then produced.<ref name="times-violence">{{cite news|title=Violence is not really Dr Who's cup of tea|publisher=[[The Times]]|first=Philip|last=Howard|date=[[1972-01-29]]|accessdate=2007-01-17|pages=2}}</ref> The same report found that 3% of the surveyed audience regarded the show as "very unsuitable" for family viewing.<ref name="times-audience">{{cite news|title=The Times Diary - Points of view|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=[[1972-01-27]]|accessdate=2007-01-17|pages=16}}</ref> However, responding to the findings of the survey in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, journalist Philip Howard maintained that: "to compare the violence of ''Dr Who'', sired by a horse-laugh out of a nightmare, with the more realistic violence of other television series, where actors who look like human beings bleed paint that looks like blood, is like comparing [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] with the property market in London: both are fantasies, but one is meant to be taken seriously."<ref name="times-violence"/>

The image of the [[TARDIS]] has become firmly linked to the show in the public's consciousness. In 1996, the BBC applied for a [[trademark]] to use the TARDIS' blue [[police box]] design in merchandising associated with ''Doctor Who''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.patent.gov.uk/tm/t-find/t-find-number?detailsrequested=C&trademark=2104259 |title=Case details for Trade Mark 2104259 |accessdate=2007-01-17 |publisher=[[UK Intellectual Property Office|UK Patent Office]] }}</ref> In 1998, the Metropolitan Police filed an objection to the trademark claim; in 2002 the [[UK Intellectual Property Office|Patent Office]] ruled in favour of the BBC,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.patent.gov.uk/tm/t-decisionmaking/t-challenge/t-challenge-decision-results/t-challenge-decision-results-bl?BL_Number=O/336/02 |title=Trade mark decision |accessdate=2007-01-17 |work=[[UK Intellectual Property Office|UK Patent Office]] website }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.patent.gov.uk/tm//legal/decisions/2002/o33602.pdf |title=IN THE MATTER OF Application No. 2104259 by The British Broadcasting Corporation to register a series of three marks in Classes 9, 16, 25 and 41 AND IN THE MATTER OF Opposition thereto under No. 48452 by The Metropolitan Police Authority |accessdate=2007-01-17 |last=Knight |first=Mike |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |publisher=[[UK Intellectual Property Office|UK Patent Office]]}}</ref> indicating that the police box image was more associated with ''Doctor Who'' than with the police.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2352743.stm |title=BBC wins police Tardis case |accessdate=2007-01-17 |date=[[2002-10-23]] |work=[[BBC News]] }}</ref>

''Doctor Who'' originally ran for [[List of Doctor Who serials|26 seasons]] on [[BBC One]], from [[23 November]] [[1963]] until [[6 December]] [[1989]]. During the original run, each weekly episode formed part of a story (or "[[Serial (radio and television)|serial]]") — usually of four to six parts in earlier years and three to four in later years. Notable exceptions were the epic ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]]'', which aired in twelve episodes (plus an earlier one-episode teaser, "[[Mission to the Unknown]]", featuring none of the regular cast),<ref name=MasterPlan>''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]].''

The programme was intended to be educational and for family viewing on the early Saturday evening schedule. Initially, it alternated stories set in the past, which would teach younger audience members about history, with stories set either in the future or in outer space to teach them about science. This was also reflected in the Doctor's original companions, one of whom was a science teacher and another a history teacher.

However, science fiction stories came to dominate the programme and the "historicals", which were not popular with the production team, were dropped after ''[[The Highlanders (Doctor Who)|The Highlanders]]'' (1967). While the show continued to use historical settings, they were generally used as a backdrop for science fiction tales, with one exception: ''[[Black Orchid (Doctor Who)|Black Orchid]]'' set in 1920s Britain.<ref name=Orchid>''[[Black Orchid (Doctor Who)|Black Orchid]].'' Writer [[Terence Dudley]], Director [[Ron Jones (television director)|Ron Jones]], Producer [[John Nathan-Turner]]. ''Doctor Who''. [[BBC]]. [[BBC One]], London. [[1 March]] [[1982]]–[[2 March]] [[1982]].</ref>

The early stories were more serial-like in nature, with the narrative of one story flowing into the next, and each episode having its own title, although produced as distinct stories with their own production codes. Following ''[[The Gunfighters]]'' (1966), however, each serial was given its own title, with the individual parts simply being assigned episode numbers. What to name these earlier stories is often [[Doctor Who story title debate|a subject of fan debate]].

Writers during the original run included [[Terry Nation]], [[Henry Lincoln]], [[Douglas Adams]], [[Robert Holmes (scriptwriter)|Robert Holmes]], [[Terrance Dicks]], [[Dennis Spooner]], [[Eric Saward]], [[Malcolm Hulke]], [[Christopher H. Bidmead]], [[Stephen Gallagher]], [[Brian Hayles]], [[Chris Boucher]], [[Peter Grimwade]], [[Marc Platt]] and [[Ben Aaronovitch]].

The serial format changed for the [[List of Doctor Who serials#Ninth Doctor|2005 revival]], with each series consisting of thirteen 45-minute, self-contained episodes (60 minutes, with adverts, on overseas commercial channels). Each series includes several standalone and multi-part stories, linked with a loose story arc that resolves in the series finale. As in the early "classic" era, each episode — whether standalone or part of a larger story — has its own title.

742 ''Doctor Who'' instalments have been televised since 1963, ranging from 25-minute episodes (the most common format), to 45-minute episodes (for ''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]'' in the 1984 series, a single season in 1985, and the revival), to two feature-length productions (1983's "[[The Five Doctors]]" and the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|1996 television movie]]), to the two 60-minute [[Christmas special#Television series specials|Christmas specials]] produced for the revival and the more recent 72 minute 2007 Christmas Special. 

The current series is recorded in 576i25 [[Betacam#Digital Betacam|DigiBeta]] wide-screen format and then [[filmizing|filmised]] to give a 25p image in post-production using a [[Snell & Wilcox]] Alchemist Platinum.

|accessdate=2007-04-30}}</ref>

Some episodes have been returned to the BBC from the archives of other countries who bought copies for broadcast, or by private individuals who got them by various means. Early colour videotape recordings made off-air by fans have also been retrieved, as well as excerpts filmed from the television screen onto 8 mm [[cine film]] and clips that were shown on other programmes. Audio versions of all of the lost episodes exist from home viewers who made tape recordings of the show. 

In addition to these, there are off-screen photographs made by photographer [[John Cura]], who was hired by various production personnel to document many of their programmes during the 1950s and 1960s, including ''Doctor Who''. These have been used in [[Doctor Who missing episodes#Reconstruction|fan reconstructions]] of the serials. These amateur reconstructions have been tolerated by the BBC, provided they are not sold for profit and are distributed as low quality VHS copies.

[[Image:Anim doczoe.jpg|thumb|The animated reconstruction of ''[[The Invasion (Doctor Who)|The Invasion]]'']]
One of the most sought-after lost episodes is Part Four of the last William Hartnell serial, ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'' (1966), which ends with the [[First Doctor]] transforming into the [[Second Doctor|Second]]. The only portion of this in existence, barring a few poor quality silent 8 mm clips, is the few seconds of the regeneration scene, as it was shown on the children's magazine show ''[[Blue Peter]]''. With the approval of the BBC, efforts are now under way to restore as many of the episodes as possible from the extant material.
Starting in the early 1990s, the BBC began to release audio recordings of missing serials on cassette and compact disc, with linking narration provided by former series actors. "Official" reconstructions have also been released by the BBC on VHS, on [[MP3]] [[CD-ROM]] and as a special feature on a DVD. The BBC, in conjunction with animation studio [[Cosgrove Hall Films|Cosgrove Hall]] has reconstructed the missing Episodes 1 and 4 of ''[[The Invasion (Doctor Who)|The Invasion]]'' (1968) in animated form, using remastered audio tracks and the comprehensive stage notes for the original filming, for the serial's DVD release in November 2006. Although no similar reconstructions have been announced as of early 2007, Cosgrove Hall has expressed an interest in animating more lost episodes in the future,<ref>''Flash Frames'', a featurette included on the DVD release of [[The Invasion (Doctor Who)|The Invasion]], [[BBC Video]], 2006.</ref> despite the announcement in April 2007 that this project is on indefinite hiatus.

In April 2006, ''Blue Peter'' launched a challenge to find these missing episodes with the promise of a full scale [[Dalek]] model.<ref>{{cite web

==Characters==
===The Doctor===
{{main|Doctor (Doctor Who)}}
[[Image:10dr19.jpg|thumb|right|250px|<center>The ten faces of the Doctor.</center><br>'''(Top)''' [[William Hartnell]], [[Patrick Troughton]], [[Jon Pertwee]]<br>'''(Middle)''' [[Tom Baker]], [[Peter Davison]], [[Colin Baker]], [[Sylvester McCoy]]<br>'''(Bottom)''' [[Paul McGann]], [[Christopher Eccleston]], [[David Tennant]]]]<!-- FAIR USE of 10dr19.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10dr19.jpg for rationale -->

The character of the Doctor was initially shrouded in mystery. All that was known about him in the programme's early days was that he was an eccentric alien traveller of great intelligence who battled injustice while exploring time and space in an unreliable old time machine called the [[TARDIS]], an acronym for '''T'''ime '''A'''nd '''R'''elative '''D'''imension(s) '''I'''n '''S'''pace. The TARDIS is much larger on the inside than on the outside<ref> Now an entry in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] the word "TARDIS" is often used to describe anything that appears larger on the inside than its exterior implies. {{cite web|url = http://www.jessesword.com/sf/view/424|title = Full record for Tardis-like adj.|work = Science Fiction Citations|accessdate=2007-09-07}}</ref> and, due to a malfunction of its [[Chameleon Circuit]] is stuck in the shape of a 1950s-style British [[police box]].

However, not only did the initially irascible and slightly sinister Doctor quickly mellow into a more compassionate figure, it was eventually revealed that he had been on the run from his own people, the [[Time Lord]]s of the planet [[Gallifrey]]. 

As a Time Lord, the Doctor has the ability to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] his body when near death. Introduced into the storyline as a way of continuing the series when the writers were faced with the departure of lead actor [[William Hartnell]] in 1966, it has continued to be a major element of the series, allowing for the recasting of the lead actor when the need arises. The serial ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' established that a Time Lord can regenerate twelve times, for a total of thirteen incarnations (although at least one Time Lord, [[Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]], has managed to circumvent this). To date, the Doctor has gone through this process and its resulting after-effects on nine occasions, with each of his incarnations having his own quirks and abilities but otherwise sharing the memories and experience of the previous incarnations:

#[[First Doctor]], played by [[William Hartnell]] (1963–1966)
#[[Second Doctor]], played by [[Patrick Troughton]] (1966–1969)
#[[Third Doctor]], played by [[Jon Pertwee]] (1970–1974)
#[[Fourth Doctor]], played by [[Tom Baker]] (1974–1981)
#[[Fifth Doctor]], played by [[Peter Davison]] (1981–1984) 
#[[Sixth Doctor]], played by [[Colin Baker]] (1984–1986)

#[[Eighth Doctor]], played by [[Paul McGann]] (1996) 
#[[Ninth Doctor]], played by [[Christopher Eccleston]] (2005)
#[[Tenth Doctor]], played by [[David Tennant]] (2005–present)

Other actors have also played the Doctor, though rarely more than once (see the [[list of actors who have played the Doctor]]). 

Despite these shifts in personality, the Doctor remains an intensely curious and highly moral adventurer who would rather solve problems with his wits than by using violence. 

Throughout the programme's long history there have been controversial revelations about the Doctor. For example, in ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'' (1976), it was hinted that the [[First Doctor]] may not have been the Doctor's first incarnation (although the other faces depicted may have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius); during the [[Seventh Doctor]]'s era it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord. In the [[Eighth Doctor]] movie, it was suggested that the Doctor was "half human", though the canonicity of this is highly contested.{{Fact|date=May 2008}} He does physically become a human in the Tenth Doctor story "[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]". The very first episode, ''[[An Unearthly Child]]'', revealed that the [[First Doctor|Doctor]] has a granddaughter, [[Susan Foreman]], and in "[[Fear Her]]" (2006), he remarked that he had, in the past, been a father. The 2005 series revealed that the [[Ninth Doctor]] thought he had become the last surviving Time Lord, and that his home planet had been destroyed. In the 2008 series episode "[[The Doctor's Daughter]]", the Doctor's cells are used to produce a daughter who is subsequently named Jenny (played by [[Georgia Moffett]], the real-life daughter of [[Fifth Doctor]] [[Peter Davison]]) by Donna as a result of the Doctor describing her as "a generated anomaly".

===Companions===
{{main|Companion (Doctor Who)}}
The Doctor almost always shares his adventures with up to three [[companion (Doctor Who)|companions]], and since 1963 more than 35 actors and actresses have featured in these roles. The First Doctor's original companions were his granddaughter [[Susan Foreman]] ([[Carole Ann Ford]]) and school teachers [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara Wright]] ([[Jacqueline Hill]]) and [[Ian Chesterton]] ([[William Russell (actor)|William Russell]]). The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]''. 

Dramatically, the [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] characters provide a [[audience surrogate|surrogate]] with whom the audience can identify, and serves to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes — or loves — on worlds they have visited. Some have even died during the course of the series.

Although the majority of the Doctor's companions have been young, attractive females, the production team for the 1963–1989 series maintained a long-standing taboo against any overt romantic involvement in the TARDIS. The taboo was controversially broken in the 1996 television film when the [[Eighth Doctor]] was shown kissing companion [[Grace Holloway]]. The 2005 series played with this idea by having various characters think that the [[Ninth Doctor]] and [[Rose (Doctor Who)|Rose]] (played by [[Billie Piper]]) were a couple, which they vehemently denied (see also [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#Romance|"The Doctor and romance"]]). The idea of a possible involvement was suggested again in "[[Smith and Jones (Doctor Who)|Smith and Jones]]", when the [[Tenth Doctor]] kisses his soon-to-be new companion [[Martha Jones]], although the Doctor insists that the kiss was simply for the purpose of 'genetic transfer'.

Previous companions reappeared in the series, usually for anniversary specials. One former companion, [[Sarah Jane Smith]] (played by [[Elisabeth Sladen]]), together with the robotic dog [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]], appeared in [[School Reunion (Doctor Who)|an episode]] of the 2006 series more than twenty years after their last appearances in the 20th Anniversary story "[[The Five Doctors]]" (1983). Afterwards, the character was featured in the spinoff series ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]''.

The most recent companions of the Tenth Doctor ([[David Tennant]]) are [[Martha Jones]] ([[Freema Agyeman]]), and [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]] ([[John Barrowman]]), both of whom depart at the end of "[[Last of the Time Lords]]". [[Catherine Tate]] reprised her role as [[Donna Noble]] from the 2006 Christmas special, becoming the Doctor's companion for the entire run of the fourth series.<ref name = "qprhig"/> Agyeman appeared as Martha Jones in three episodes of the spin-off series ''Torchwood'' before returning to ''Doctor Who'' halfway through the fourth series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2007/07/02/46692.shtml |title=More Martha! |accessdate=2007-07-02 |work=[[bbc.co.uk]] }}</ref>.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6260374.stm|title=Doctor Who to get extra companion|accessdate=2007-07-02 |work=[[bbc.co.uk]] }}</ref> [[Billie Piper]] briefly reprised her role as [[Rose Tyler]] in the Series 4 episode [[Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)|Partners in Crime]] and will return to the series from "[[Turn Left (Doctor Who)|Turn Left]]" to "[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7114699.stm |title=Billie Piper to return to Dr Who | accessdate=2007-11-27 |work=[[bbc.c.uk]] }} </ref> For the 2007 Christmas episode "[[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage of the Damned]]", the Doctor's companion was [[Astrid Peth]], played by Australian performer [[Kylie Minogue]].

Though arguably not a companion, [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]] was a recurring character in the original series making his first appearance alongside the Second Doctor and his final alongside the Seventh. The actor [[Nicholas Courtney]] who portrayed the Brigadier had previously also starred as Bret Vyon alongside first Doctor William Hartnell in the 12-part [[The Daleks' Master Plan]], earning him the distinction of being the only actor to appear with every doctor (except Colin Baker) of the classic series. His photo appears among Sarah Jane Smith's personal items in "[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]." He and [[UNIT]] appeared regularly during the Third Doctor's tenure, and it has continued to appear or be referred to in the revival of the show and its spin-offs.

==Adversaries==
{{see also|List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens|List of Doctor Who villains}}
[[Image:Dalek - Dr Who.jpg|thumb|The [[Dalek]]s are perhaps the best-known adversaries faced by the Doctor.]]
When Sydney Newman commissioned the series, he specifically did not want to perpetuate the cliché of the "bug-eyed monster" of science fiction. However, [[list of Doctor Who monsters and aliens|monsters]] were a staple of ''Doctor Who'' almost from the beginning and were popular with audiences. Notable adversaries of the Doctor in the original series include the [[Auton]]s, the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]], the [[Sontaran]]s, the [[Zygon]]s, the [[Sea Devil (Doctor Who)|Sea Devils]], the [[Silurian (Doctor Who)|Silurians]], the [[Ice Warrior]]s, the [[Rani (Doctor Who)|Rani]], the [[Yeti (Doctor Who)|Yeti]], [[Davros]] (the creator of the Daleks), [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] (a Time Lord with a thirst for universal conquest), and, most notably, the [[Dalek]]s. This continued with the resurrection of the series in 2005.

Executive producer for the new series, Russell T Davies, stated that it had always been his intention to bring back classic [[Cultural icon|icons]] of ''Doctor Who'' one step at a time: Daleks in series 1, Cybermen in series 2, and the Master in series 3.  Series 1 began this trend in the very first episode "[[Rose]]" with the [[Auton]]s and Nestene Consciousness from the third Doctor's "[[Spearhead from Space]]" and "[[Terror of the Autons]]." Series 3 also saw the return of the seldom-seen Macra, albeit in a subplot, last seen only once in the second Doctor's "[[The Macra Terror]]."  He has also stated that he is not finished and will continue reviving villains from the original series.<ref name="Confidential">{{cite web

 | publisher = [[BBC News]]}}</ref> Series 4 saw the return of the [[Sontaran]]s in a double episode. The new series has also introduced new monsters, including the [[Slitheen]], the [[Ood]], and the [[Judoon]].

===Daleks===
{{main|Dalek}}
Of all the monsters and villains, the ones that have most secured the series' place in the public's imagination are the [[Dalek]]s, who first appeared in 1963 and were the series' very first "monster". The Daleks are Kaled mutants in tank-like mechanical armour shells from the planet [[Skaro]]. Their chief role in the great scheme of things, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to "Exterminate!" all beings inferior to themselves, even destroying the [[Time Lord]]s in the often referenced but never shown [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]]. [[Davros]], the Daleks' creator, became a recurring villain after he was introduced in ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]'', in which the Time Lords send the Doctor back to either destroy the Daleks, avert their creation, or tamper with their genetic structure to make them less warlike. Davros has been played by [[Michael Wisher]] (first introduced in ''Genesis of the Daleks''), [[David Gooderson]] (''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]''), and [[Terry Molloy]].

The Daleks were created by writer [[Terry Nation]] (who intended them as an [[allegory]] of the [[Nazism|Nazis]])<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/N/htmlN/nationterry/nationterry.htm | title = NATION, TERRY | accessdate = 2008-05-19}}</ref> and BBC designer [[Raymond Cusick]]. The Daleks' début in the programme's second serial, ''[[The Daleks]]'' (1963–64), caused a tremendous reaction in the viewing figures and the public, putting ''Doctor Who'' on the cultural map. A Dalek appeared on a postage stamp celebrating British popular culture in 1999, photographed by [[Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon|Lord Snowdon]].

===Cybermen===
{{main|Cybermen}}
Cybermen were originally a wholly organic species of humanoids originating on Earth's twin planet Mondas that began to implant more and more artificial parts into their bodies. This led to the race becoming coldly logical and calculating, with emotions usually only shown when naked aggression was called for.

===The Master===
{{main|Master (Doctor Who)}}
[[Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]] is a renegade [[Time Lord]], and the Doctor's nemesis. Conceived as "[[Professor Moriarty]] to the Doctor's [[Sherlock Holmes]],"<ref>''Doctor Who Magazine Special Edition'' #2, 5 September 2002, [subtitled ''The Complete Third Doctor''], page 14)</ref> the character first appeared in 1971. As with the Doctor, the role has been portrayed by several actors, the first being [[Roger Delgado]] who continued in the role until his death in 1973. The Master was briefly played by [[Peter Pratt]] and [[Geoffrey Beevers]] until [[Anthony Ainley]] took over and continued to play the character until Doctor Who's cancellation in 1989. The Master returned in the 1996 television movie of ''[[Doctor Who (1996 film)|Doctor Who]]'', played by Gordon Tipple in the pre-credits sequence, then [[Eric Roberts]], and in the three-part finale of the 2007 series, portrayed by [[Derek Jacobi]] and [[John Simm]].

==Music==
===Theme music===
{{main|Doctor Who theme music}}
{{sample box start variation 2|Audio sample composed by Ron Grainer:}}
{{Listen|filename=Doctor Who theme excerpt.ogg|title=Doctor Who theme excerpt|description=An excerpt from the theme music to ''Doctor Who''}}
{{sample box end}}
The original 1963 [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop|radiophonic]] arrangement of the ''Doctor Who'' theme is widely regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, and ''Doctor Who'' was the first television series in the world to have a theme entirely realised through electronic means. 

The original theme was composed by [[Ron Grainer]] and realised by [[Delia Derbyshire]] at the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], with assistance from [[Dick Mills]]. The various parts were built up by creating [[tape loop]]s of an individually struck piano string and individual test [[Oscillation|oscillator]]s and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of [[List of Doctor Who serials#Season 17 (1979-80)|Season 17]] (1979–80).

A more modern and dynamic arrangement was composed by [[Peter Howell]] for [[List of Doctor Who serials#Season 18 (1980-81)|Season 18]] (1980), which was in turn replaced by [[Dominic Glynn]]'s arrangement for Season 23's ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' (1986). [[Keff McCulloch]] provided the new arrangement for the [[Seventh Doctor]]'s era which lasted from [[List of Doctor Who serials#Season 24 (1987)|Season 24]] (1987) until the series' suspension in 1989. For the new series in 2005, [[Murray Gold]] provided a new arrangement which featured samples from the 1963 original with further elements added; in the 2005 Christmas episode "[[The Christmas Invasion]]", Gold introduced a modified closing credits arrangement that was used up until the conclusion of the 2007 series.

A new arrangement of the theme, once again by Gold, was introduced in the 2007 Christmas special episode, "[[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage of the Damned]]". 

Versions of the "Doctor Who Theme" have also been released in a [[pop music]] venue over the years. In the early 1970s, [[Jon Pertwee]], who had played the [[Third Doctor]], recorded a version of the Doctor Who theme with spoken lyrics, titled, "Who Is the Doctor". In 1988 the band [[The KLF|The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu]] (later known as [[The KLF]]) released the single "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]" under the name [[Doctorin' the Tardis|The Timelords]], which reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 in Australia; this version incorporated several other songs, including "Rock and Roll Part 2" by [[Gary Glitter]] (who recorded vocals for some of the CD-single remix versions of "Doctorin' the Tardis"). Others who have covered or reinterpreted the theme include [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]], [[Pink Floyd]], the Australian string ensemble [[FourPlay Electric String Quartet|Fourplay]], New Zealand punk band [[Blam Blam Blam]], [[The Pogues]], and the comedians [[Bill Bailey]] and [[Mitch Benn]], and satirised on ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]''. A reggae/ska version of the Doctor Who theme tune was released on the Explosion label in 1969 by Bongo Herman and Les. The theme tune has also appeared on many compilation CDs and has made its way into [[mobile phone]] ring tones. Fans have also produced and distributed their own remixes of the theme.

===Incidental music===
Most of the innovative incidental music for ''Doctor Who'' has been specially commissioned from freelance composers, although in the early years some episodes also used [[Royalty free music|stock music]], as well as occasional excerpts from original recordings or [[cover version]]s of songs by popular music acts such as [[The Beatles]] and [[The Beach Boys]].

The incidental music for the first ''Doctor Who'' adventure, ''An Unearthly Child'', was written by [[Norman Kay (composer)|Norman Kay]]. Many of the stories of the [[William Hartnell]] period were scored by electronic music pioneer [[Tristram Cary]], whose ''Doctor Who'' credits include ''The Daleks'', ''[[Marco Polo (Doctor Who)|Marco Polo]]'', ''The Daleks' Master Plan'', ''The Gunfighters'' and ''[[The Mutants]]''. Other composers in this early period were included [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], [[Carey Blyton]] and [[Geoffrey Burgon]].

The most frequent musical contributor during the first fifteen years was [[Dudley Simpson]], who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for ''[[Blake's 7]]''. Simpson's first ''Doctor Who'' score was ''[[Planet of Giants]]'' (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the Sixties and Seventies, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee / Tom Baker periods, ending with ''[[The Horns of Nimon]]'' (1979). He also made a [[cameo appearance]] in ''The Talons of Weng-Chiang'' (as a [[Music hall]] conductor).

Beginning with ''[[The Leisure Hive]]'' (1980), the task of creating incidental music was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop. [[Paddy Kingsland]] and [[Peter Howell]] contributed many scores in this period and other contributors included [[Roger Limb]], [[Malcolm Clarke]] and [[Jonathan Gibbs (composer)|Jonathan Gibbs]].

The Radiophonic Workshop was dropped after the ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' season, and [[Keff McCulloch]] took over as the series' main composer, with [[Dominic Glynn]] and [[Mark Ayres]] also contributing scores.

All the incidental music for the 2005 revived series has been composed by Murray Gold and Ben Foster and has been performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales from the 2005 Christmas episode ''The Christmas Invasion'' onwards. A concert featuring the orchestra performing music from the first two series took place on [[19 November]] [[2006]] to raise money for [[Children in Need]]. [[David Tennant]] hosted the event, introducing the different sections of the concert. [[Murray Gold]] and [[Russell T Davies]] answered questions during the interval and [[Dalek]]s and [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] menaced the audience whilst music from their stories was played. The concert aired on [[BBCi]] on Christmas Day 2006.

The new series has featured occasional use of excerpts of pop music from the Seventies, Eighties, Nineties and early 2000s, including works by [[Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick|Ian Dury and the Blockheads]], [[Tainted love#Soft Cell version|Soft Cell]], [[Voodoo Child (song)|Rogue Traders]], [[Toxic (song)|Britney Spears]] and the [[Ta-Dah|Scissor Sisters]]. The [[Doctor Who: Original Television Soundtrack|soundtrack for Series 1 and 2]] was released on [[4 December]] [[2006]] by [[Silva Screen Records]].<ref>{{cite web

===Special sound===
''Doctor Who'''s science-fiction themes and settings meant that many sound effects had to be specially created for the series, although some common sound effects (such as crowds, horses and jungle noises) were sourced from stock recordings. Because ''Doctor Who'' began several years before the advent of the first mass-produced [[synthesizer]]s, much of the equipment used to create electronic sound effects in the early days was custom-built by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop and until the early 1970s audio effects were produced using a combination of electronic and [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop|radiophonic]] techniques.

Almost all of the original sound effects and audio backgrounds during the 1960s were overseen by the Radiophonic Workshop's [[Brian Hodgson]], who worked on ''Doctor Who'' from its inception until the middle of Jon Pertwee's tenure in the early 1970s, when he was succeeded by [[Dick Mills]]. Hodgson created hundreds of pieces of "special sound" ranging from ray-gun blasts to dinosaurs, but without doubt his best known sound effects are the sound of the TARDIS as it de-materialises and re-appears, and the voices of the [[Dalek]]s. 

The basic audio source Hodgson used for the TARDIS effect was the sound of his house keys being scraped up and down along the strings of an old gutted piano, and played backwards. The famous Dalek voice effect was obtained by passing the actors' voices through a device called a [[Ring modulation|ring modulator]], and it was further enhanced by exploiting the [[distortion]] inherent in the microphones and amplifiers then in use. However, the precise sonic character of the Daleks' voices varied somewhat over time because the original frequency settings used on the ring modulator were never noted down.

==Viewership==
[[Image:TARDIS.jpg|right|thumb|180px|The image of the [[TARDIS]] is iconic in British popular culture.]]
''Doctor Who'' has always appeared on the BBC's mainstream [[BBC One]] channel, where it is regarded as a family show, drawing audiences of many millions of viewers. It was most popular in the late 1970s, with audiences frequently as high as 12 million. During the [[ITV]] network strike of 1979, viewership peaked at 16 million. No first-run episode of ''Doctor Who'' has ever drawn fewer than three million viewers on BBC One, although its late 1980s performance of three to five million viewers was seen as poor at the time and was, according to the BBC Board of Control, a leading cause of the programme's 1989 suspension. Some fans considered this disingenuous, since the programme was scheduled against the [[soap opera]] ''[[Coronation Street]]'', the most popular show at the time. The BBC One broadcast of "[[Rose (Doctor Who)|Rose]]", the first episode of the 2005 revival, drew an average audience of 10.81 million, third highest for BBC One that week and seventh across all channels. The 2006 episode "[[Rise of the Cybermen]]" managed sixth place in the charts across the week with 9.22 million viewers.<ref>{{cite journal

The current revival also garners the highest audience [[Appreciation Index]] of any non-[[soap opera|soap]] drama on television.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2007/11/these_scifi_people_vote.php | title=“These sci-fi people vote” | author=Mark Wright | publisher=[[The Stage]] | date=[[2007-11-01]] | accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref>

The series also has a fan base in the [[United States]], where it was shown in syndication from the 1970s to the 1990s, particularly on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] stations (see [[Doctor Who in North America]]). [[New Zealand]] was the first country outside the UK to screen ''Doctor Who'' beginning in September 1964, and continued to screen the series for many years, including the new series from 2005. In [[Canada]], the series debuted in January 1965, but the CBC only aired the first twenty-six episodes. [[TVOntario]] picked up the show in 1976 beginning with ''[[The Three Doctors]]'' and aired it through to Season 24 in 1991. TVO's schedule ran several years behind the BBC's throughout this period. From 1979 to 1981, TVO airings were bookended by science-fiction writer [[Judith Merril]] who would introduce the episode and then, after the episode concluded, try to place it in an educational context in keeping with TVO's status as an educational channel. The airing of ''[[The Talons of Weng-Chiang]]'' resulted in controversy for TVOntario as a result of accusations that the story was [[racism|racist]]. Consequently the story was not rebroadcast. CBC began showing the series again in 2005.

Likewise, a huge fan base exists in [[Australia]], where it has been exclusively first run on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation | ABC]], and periodically repeated - including screening all available episodes for the show's 40th anniversary in 2003.  Repeats have also been shown on the subscription television channel [[UK.TV]].  The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation | ABC]] also broadcasts the first run of the revived series, on [[ABC1]], with repeats on [[ABC2]].  [[UK.TV]] also shows repeats of the revived series.

The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation | ABC]] also provided partial funding for the 20th anniversary special episode, entitled "The Five Doctors".

Only four episodes have ever had their premier showings on channels other than BBC One. The 1983 twentieth anniversary special "[[The Five Doctors]]" had its début on [[23 November]] (the actual date of the anniversary) on the [[Chicago]] [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] station [[WTTW]] in the United States and various other PBS members two days prior to its BBC One broadcast. The 1988 story ''[[Silver Nemesis]]'' was broadcast with all three episodes edited together in compilation form on [[Television New Zealand|TVNZ]] in New Zealand in November, after the first episode had been shown in the UK but before the final two instalments had aired there. Finally, the 1996 television film premièred on [[12 May]] [[1996]] on [[CITV-TV|CITV]] in [[Edmonton]], Canada, fifteen days before the BBC One showing, and two days before it aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the US.

A wide selection of serials is available from BBC Video on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]], on sale in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States. Every fully extant serial has been released on VHS, and BBC Worldwide continues to regularly release serials on DVD. The 2005 series is also available in its entirety on [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] for the [[PlayStation Portable]]

As of September 2007, the revived series had been, or was currently, broadcast weekly in [[Australia]] (ABC), [[Austria]] ([[ProSieben|Pro 7]]), [[Belgium]] ([[Één]]), [[Brazil]] ([[People+Arts]]), [[Canada]] in English on ([[CBC Television|CBC]]) and in French on ([[Ztélé]]), [[Denmark]] ([[Danmarks Radio]]), [[Finland]] ([[YLE|TV2]]), [[France]] ([[France 4]]), [[Germany]] ([[ProSieben|Pro 7]]), [[Hong Kong]] ([[Asia Television Limited|ATV World]]) and [[BBC Entertainment]], [[Hungary]] ([[RTL Klub]]-owned COOL TV), [[Ireland]] ([[TV3 Ireland|TV3]]), [[Israel]] ([[Yes Stars 2]]), [[Italy]] ([[Jimmy (TV channel)|Jimmy]]), [[Japan]] ([[BS-2]], a channel of [[NHK]]), [[Malaysia]] ([[Astro (satellite TV)|Astro Network]]), the [[Netherlands]] ([[Nederland 3|NED 3]]), [[New Zealand]] ([[Prime Television New Zealand|Prime TV]]), [[Norway]] ([[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|NRK]]), [[Poland]] ([[TVP1]]), [[Portugal]] ([[People+Arts]], [[SIC Radical]]), [[Russia]] ([[STS TV]]), [[Spain]] and [[Latin America]] ([[People+Arts]]), [[South Korea]] ([[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS2]] (dubbed in Korean) and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] (subtitled in Korean)), [[Sweden]] ([[Sveriges Television|SVT]]), [[Switzerland]] ([[ProSieben|Pro 7]]), [[Thailand]] ([[BBTV Channel 7|Channel 7]] and [[BBC Entertainment]]), [[Turkey]] ([[Cine5]]), the [[United States]] ([[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] [first run], public television [second run] and [[BBC America]] [second run]), [[Greece]] ([[Skai TV]]), [[Style UK]] (part of [[Showtime Arabia]]) for the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and the [[Levant]] territories. The series has also been sold to, but not yet shown in [[Romania]] ([[Romanian Television|TVR]]). 

A special logo has been designed for the Japanese broadcast with the [[katakana]] "ドクター・フー" ([[Romanization of Japanese|romanised]] as ''Dokutaa Fuu'').<ref>{{cite web

The series one episodes aired in Canada a couple of weeks after their UK broadcast, a situation made possible by the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]] which left vast gaps in CBC's schedule. For the Canadian broadcast, Christopher Eccleston recorded special video introductions for each episode (including a trivia question as part of a viewer contest) and excerpts from the ''Doctor Who Confidential'' documentary were played over the closing credits; for the broadcast of "[[The Christmas Invasion]]" on [[26 December]][[2005]], [[Billie Piper]] recorded a special video introduction. CBC began airing series two on [[9 October]][[2006]] at 8:00 pm E/P (8:30 in Newfoundland and Labrador), shortly after that day's [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] double header on [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|Thanksgiving]] in most of the country.

===Fandom===
{{main|Doctor Who fandom}}
''Doctor Who'' has amassed a large number of fans from all over the world. In addition, the series is a mainstream part of [[popular culture]] in its native UK,<ref name="icon"/> where it is is shown on the main public service broadcasting channel, [[BBC One]].

==Adaptations and other appearances==
===Dr. Who movies===
{{main|Dr. Who (Dalek films)}}
There were two "Dr. Who" cinema films: ''[[Dr. Who and the Daleks]]'' in 1965 and ''[[Daleks - Invasion Earth 2150 AD]]'' in 1966. Both were essentially retellings of existing TV stories (specifically, the first two Dalek serials) on the big screen, with a larger budget and alterations to the series concept. 

In these [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)|films]], [[Peter Cushing]] played a human scientist named "Dr. Who", who travelled with his two granddaughters and other companions in a time machine he invented. The [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)#Other appearances|Cushing version]] of the character reappeared in both comic strip and literary form, the latter attempting to reconcile the film continuity with that of the series.

In addition, a number of planned films were proposed including a sequel, [[The Chase (Doctor Who)|The Chase]] loosely based on the original series story (the third to feature the same antagonists), for the Cushing Doctor, plus many attempted TVM and big screen productions to revive the original [[Doctor Who]], after the original series was cancelled. (See [[List of unmade Doctor Who serials and films#Proposed films]])

===Spin-offs===
{{main|Doctor Who spin-offs}}
''Doctor Who'' has appeared on stage numerous times. In the early 1970s, [[Trevor Martin]] played the role in ''[[Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday]]'' which also featured former companion actress [[Wendy Padbury]] (Pertwee's Doctor made a cameo appearance via film). In the early 1990s, Jon Pertwee and Colin Baker both played the Doctor at different times during the run of a musical play titled ''[[Doctor Who - The Ultimate Adventure]]''. For two performances while Pertwee was ill, [[David Banks]] (best known for playing various [[Cyberman|Cybermen]]) played the Doctor. Other original plays have been staged as amateur productions, with other actors playing the Doctor, while [[Terry Nation]] wrote ''[[The Curse of the Daleks]]'', a stage play mounted in the late 1960s, but without the Doctor.

A pilot episode for a potential spin-off series, ''[[K-9 and Company]]'', was aired in 1981 with [[Elisabeth Sladen]] reprising her role as companion [[Sarah Jane Smith]] and [[John Leeson]] as the voice of [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]], but was not picked up as a regular series.

Concept art for an animated ''Doctor Who'' series was produced by animation company [[Nelvana]] in the 1980s, but the series was not produced.<ref name="nelvana">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/planetofthedoctor/tb_gallery.html|title=Planet of the Doctor|accessdate=2007-02-20}}</ref>

The Doctor has also appeared in webcasts and in audio plays; prominent among the latter were those produced by [[Big Finish Productions]] from 1999 onwards, who were responsible for a [[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish|range of audio plays]] released on CD, as well as 2006's eight-part [[BBC 7]] series starring [[Paul McGann]]. 

Following the success of the 2005 series produced by Russell T. Davies, the BBC commissioned Davies to produce a 13-part spin-off series titled ''[[Torchwood]]'' (an [[anagram]] of "Doctor Who"), set in modern-day Wales and investigating alien activities and crime. The series debuted on [[BBC Three]] on [[22 October]] [[2006]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cgi-perl/whatson/prog_parse.cgi?FILENAME=20061022/20061022_2150_2075_8189_50 Torchwood programme information], BBC Three listings.

A second series of ''[[Torchwood]]'' began in January 2008 with [[John Barrowman]] reprising his role as '' Captain Jack Harkness'' and [[Freema Agyeman]] reprising her ''Doctor Who'' role of [[Martha Jones]] for three episodes.

===Charity episodes===
In 1993, coinciding with the series' 30th anniversary, a charity special entitled "[[Dimensions in Time]]" was produced in aid of [[Children in Need]], featuring all of the surviving actors who played the Doctor and a number of previous companions. Not taken seriously by many, the story had the [[Rani (Doctor Who)|Rani]] opening a hole in time, cycling the Doctor and his companions through his previous incarnations and menacing them with monsters from the show's past. It also featured a crossover with the soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'', the action taking place in the latter's [[Albert Square]] location and around [[Greenwich]], including the ''[[Cutty Sark]]''. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the [[Pulfrich effect]] requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look perfectly normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses.

[[Image:Curseoffataldeath.jpg|thumb|[[Rowan Atkinson]] as the Doctor and [[Julia Sawalha]] as Emma in the [[parody]] "[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death|The Curse of Fatal Death]]".]]
In 1999, another special, "[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]", was made for [[Comic Relief]] and later released on [[VHS]]. An affectionate [[parody]] of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with [[cliffhanger]]s, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased. (The version released on [[video]] was split into only two episodes.) In the story, the Doctor ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) encounters both [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[Jonathan Pryce]]) and the [[Dalek]]s. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, [[Richard E. Grant]], [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Hugh Grant]], and [[Joanna Lumley]]. The script was written by [[Steven Moffat]], later to be head writer and executive producer to the revived series.<ref name=RTDgone />

As noted above, on [[18 November]], [[2005]], an untitled [[Doctor Who: Children in Need|7-minute "mini-episode"]], set in the immediate aftermath of "[[The Parting of the Ways]]" and leading directly into "[[The Christmas Invasion]]", was shown as part of the Children in Need [[telethon]].

On [[16 November]], [[2007]] Peter Davison appeared with David Tennant in a reprise of his Fifth Doctor in a Children in Need special called "[[Time Crash]]", written by future executive producer<ref name=RTDgone /> Steven Moffat.

===Spoofs and cultural references===
{{main|Doctor Who spoofs}}
''Doctor Who'' has been satirised and spoofed on many occasions by comedians including [[Spike Milligan]] and [[Lenny Henry]]. [[Doctor Who fandom|''Doctor Who'' fandom]] has also been lampooned on programmes such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]'', ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', and ''[[The Simpsons]]''. 

[[Image:Simpsons Doctor Who.jpg|thumb|The [[Fourth Doctor]] on ''[[The Simpsons]]'']]
The Doctor in his fourth incarnation has been represented on several episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', starting with the episode "[[Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming]]". [[Jon Culshaw]] frequently impersonates the Fourth Doctor in the BBC ''[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'' series. Culshaw's "Doctor" has telephoned four of the "real" Doctors — Tom Baker, Peter Davison, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy — in character as the Fourth Doctor. In the 2005 ''Dead Ringers'' Christmas special, broadcast shortly before "[[The Christmas Invasion]]", Culshaw impersonated both the Fourth and Tenth Doctors, while the Second, Seventh and Ninth Doctors were impersonated by [[Mark Perry (impressionist)|Mark Perry]], [[Kevin Connelly]] and [[Phil Cornwell]], respectively. 

Less a spoof and more of a [[pastiche]] is the character of Professor Justin Alphonse Gamble, a renegade from the [[Time Variance Authority]], who appeared in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' #79 and ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] Annual'' #22. His enemies include the rogue robots known as the Dredlox.<ref>{{cite web

There have also been many references to ''Doctor Who'' in popular culture and other science fiction franchises, including ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' ("[[The Neutral Zone (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Neutral Zone]]", among others) and ''[[The Invisible Man (2000 TV series)|The Invisible Man]]'' (in the pilot episode, a torn business card for [[Doctor_%28Doctor_Who%29#.22Doctor_who.3F.22|I.M. Foreman]]: Scrap Metal & Salvage is used for identification). In the Channel 4 series ''[[Queer as Folk (UK TV series)|Queer As Folk]]'' (created by current ''Doctor Who'' executive producer Russell T. Davies), the character of Vince was portrayed as an avid ''Doctor Who'' fan, with references appearing many times throughout in the form of clips from the programme.  References to ''Doctor Who'' have also appeared in the young adult fantasy novel ''[[High Wizardry]]'',<ref>{{cite web

Doctor Who has long been a popular amateur show to impersonate, with lots of 'homemade' version being made for charity. One such of these is a Doctor Who 5-series mini show,made in Lancaster starting with ''[[Stone Orchid]]'', and ending with ''[[Two leaves left]]''.

===Merchandise===
{{main|Doctor Who merchandise}}
Since its beginnings, ''Doctor Who'' has generated many hundreds of products related to the show, from [[toy]]s and [[game]]s to collectible [[Trade card|picture cards]] and [[postage stamp]]s. These include [[board game]]s, [[card game]]s, [[gamebook]]s, [[Personal computer game|computer game]]s, [[Role-playing game|roleplaying games]] and [[action figure]]s.

Many games have been released that feature the [[Dalek]]s. See [[Dalek#Computer games|Dalek computer games]].

===Books===
''Doctor Who'' books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day. Since the relaunch of the programme in 2005, a new range of novels have been published by [[BBC Books]], featuring the adventures of the Ninth and Tenth Doctors.

==Awards==
Although ''Doctor Who'' was fondly regarded during its original 1963–1989 run, it received little critical recognition at the time. In 1975, [[List of Doctor Who serials#Season 11 (1973–74)|Season 11]] of the series won a Writers' Guild of Great Britain award for Best Writing in a Children's Serial. In 1996, BBC television held the "Auntie Awards" as the culmination of their "TV60" season, celebrating sixty years of BBC television broadcasting, where ''Doctor Who'' was voted as the "Best Popular Drama" the corporation had ever produced, ahead of such ratings heavyweights as ''[[EastEnders]]'' and ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]''.<ref name="auntieawards">{{cite news|title=Viewers spurn TV's golden age in poll of small screen classics as the BBC fetes its 60th birthday|first=Andrew|last=Culf|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=[[1996-11-04]]|page=4}}</ref> In 2000, ''Doctor Who'' was ranked third in a list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the twentieth century, produced by the [[British Film Institute]] and voted on by industry professionals.<ref name="tv100">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/911085.stm|title=Fawlty Towers tops TV hits|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=[[2000-09-05]]|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref> In 2005, the series came first in a survey by [[SFX magazine]] of "The Greatest UK Science Fiction and Fantasy Television Series Ever".

The revived series has received particular recognition from critics and the public. In 2005, at the [[National Television Awards]] (voted on by members of the British public), ''Doctor Who'' won "Most Popular Drama", Christopher Eccleston won "Most Popular Actor" and Billie Piper won "Most Popular Actress". The series and Piper repeated their wins at the 2006 National Television Awards, and David Tennant won "Most Popular Actor" in 2006 and 2007, with the series again taking the Most Popular Drama award in 2007.<ref>{{cite news
