'''''Argiope mascordi''''' is a species of [[Orb-weaver spider|orb-web spider]] found in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. This the females of this species are smaller and less colourful than many other spiders in the Genus ''[[St Andrew's Cross spider|Argiope]]''. 

Like many other spider species very little is known about their biology. However, they possess a couple of interesting characteristics that distinguish them from their better-known relatives. Firstly, whilst they exhibit female biased [[Sexual dimorphism|sexual size dimorphism]] the difference between males and females is smaller than in other species, mainly because the males are larger than many other ''Argiope''. Secondly, the [[web decorations]] in this species are different to those of other Argiope. Usually juveniles construct disc shaped decorations and the adults construct either a line (eg. ''[[Argiope picta]]'') or a cross (eg. ''[[Argiope keyserlingi]]''). However, in ''A. mascordi'' juveniles construct a cross and adults construct a disc. The reason for this apparent reversal in decorating behaviour remains unknown.
