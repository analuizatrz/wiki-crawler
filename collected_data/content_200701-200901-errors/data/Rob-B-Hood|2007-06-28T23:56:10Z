'''''Rob-B-Hood''''' ({{zh-st|s=宝贝计划|t=寶貝計劃}}) is an [[Action film|Action]], [[Comedy]] film starring [[Jackie Chan]]. It officially made its international debut at the 2006 [[Venice Film Festival]] on September 29, 2006. Rob-b-Hood was predominantly filmed on location in [[Hong Kong]].

The films tagline:
''This September! Crawl Baby Crawl!''

==Plot==

 

The film follows a group of thieves made up of Thongs (Chan), Octopus ([[Louis Koo]]), and Landlord ([[Michael Hui]]). They steal for different reasons. Thongs is a compulsive gambler who faces debt collectors at his door. Octopus spends his fortunes to court a rich girl. Landlord does not spend his loot, but saves all of it and keeps it in a safe in his house. After Landlord's house was broke into and all his savings stolen, he was desperate to regain his fortune and accepted a job offer that will pay him in huge sums. At the same time Thongs and Octopus were both in desperate need of money again, and they went for the job without knowing the details. Only after breaking in did they know that Landlord was asked to steal a baby, and return it to the baby's alleged grandfather, who is also the head of a Triad. When they were on the way to hand over the baby, they ran through a police road block, resulting in a car crash. Landlord was hospitalized and kept in police custody because of the accident, while Thongs and Octopus was forced to take care of the baby, deciding that it will be best to hold on to their prize before the Landlord is released. They faced challenges from all fronts, including the Triads, Thongs' creditors, Octopus wife and of course, the baby they've stolen.

==Behind the scenes==

[[Jackie Chan]] was tired of being [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as an actor who always plays a 'Mr Nice Guy' type role in all of his films. In this film (originally titled Project BB, Project Baby or Baby Plan), Jackie Chan plays a bad guy for one of the first times since some of his very early films before he even became famous. 

[[Jackie Chan]] wrote the story himself and [[Alan Yuen]] wrote the screenplay for the film. The original idea was for two of his school brothers, [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Yuen Biao]] to appear in the film alongside him, but that didn't happen. Only [[Yuen Biao]] appears in the film.

The film reportedly went over-budget due to delays caused by baby Matthew's excessive sleeping on set. Though this is expected of an infant his age, the tight schedule was unable to accommodate it.
