[[Image:Slc_mormon_tempel.jpg|thumb|right|235px|The [[Salt Lake Temple]] of '''The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''' is the largest attraction in the city's [[Temple Square]].]]

'''The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''', widely known as the '''LDS Church''' or the '''Mormon Church''', is the largest and most well-known [[Religious denomination|denomination]] originating from the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] (a group of churches and adherents who follow the teachings of [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]]). The church is headquartered in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], and has established churches and [[temple (Latter Day Saints)|temples]] worldwide, counting nearly 13 million members on its rolls.

Adherents to the church (usually called ''[[Mormon]]s'' or ''Latter-day Saints'') believe that [[Jesus]] as the head of their church via [[revelation]] given to the [[President of the Church (Latter Day Saints)|President of the Church]] whom they consider to be a [[prophet]]. They count themselves as Christians, but do not consider themselves part of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]], or [[Protestantism|Protestant]] traditions. Instead, they believe that the church is a [[restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restoration]] of [[1st century]] Christianity. They believe in the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]], but have added three books to their [[Biblical canon]]: the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'', the ''[[Doctrine and Covenants]]'', and the ''[[Pearl of Great Price]]''.

Historically, the church has distinguished itself from modern Christianity by its biblical practice of [[polygamy]] (officially discontinued in 1890), and by its other unique doctrines and practices such as the [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|Endowment]], [[baptism for the dead]], and its views on the [[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)|Godhead]]. The church teaches that it is "the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth" ([[Doctrine and Covenants|LDS D&C]], 1:30), but it has cooperated with other churches in promoting humanitarian and moral causes.

== History of the Church ==
{{main|History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the largest continuation of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]], founded by [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] on [[April 6]] [[1830]] in either the [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]]-[[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra]] area or [[Fayette, New York]].<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>The majority of witnesses say the church was organized [[April 6]] [[1830]] in the log home of Joseph Smith, Sr. in the [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]] area, followed by a meeting the next Sunday in nearby [[Fayette, New York|Fayette]] at the home of [[Peter Whitmer, Sr.]] Nevertheless, one of Smith's histories and a later reminiscence by [[David Whitmer]] say the church was organized at the Whitmer home in Fayette. See [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)]]. The Church refers to Fayette as the place of organization in all its official publications.</ref><!--

--> Joseph Smith established this early church soon after publishing the ''[[Book of Mormon]]''. Largely due to the convincing power of this book, which Smith said he translated by a heavenly power, the church rapidly gained a large following who viewed Smith as a [[prophet]].

In late 1830, Smith envisioned a [[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|"city of Zion"]] in [[Native Americans|Native American]] lands near [[Independence, Missouri]]. In October 1830 he sent his second-in-command [[Oliver Cowdery]] and others on a mission to the area<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|32}}</ref>. Passing through [[Kirtland, Ohio]], the missionaries converted a congregation of [[Disciples of Christ]] led by [[Sidney Rigdon]], and in 1831, Smith decided to temporarily move his followers to Kirtland until the Missouri area could be colonized. The church headquarters remained in Kirtland from 1831 to 1838; meanwhile, the church built [[Kirtland Temple|its first temple]], and grew in size.

On [[July 20]], [[1831]] Smith circulated a written revelation that [[Independence, Missouri]] was to be the center place for the city of Zion.[http://scriptures.lds.org/dc/57/1-3] Though many of Smith's followers attempted to colonize Missouri throughout the 1830s, and Smith himself moved there in 1838, the church faced political and military opposition by other Missouri settlers. After a series of raids on Mormon settlements, the church formed its own militia and the [[Mormon War]] if 1838 ensued, culminating in the religion being expelled from the state under an [[Extermination Order]] signed by [[Lilburn W. Boggs|the governor of Missouri]]. The church then established its new headquarters in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], a city they built on drained swampland by the [[Mississippi River]], where Joseph Smith Jr. served as mayor. There, the church built a [[Nauvoo Temple|new temple]], and thrived until Smith and his brother Hyrum, whom most agree would have been Joseph's successor, were [[death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|killed by a mob]] in 1844. They were awaiting trial for their decision to destroy a [[Nauvoo Expositor|local newspaper]] that said Smith was practicing a form of [[polygamy]] and that he intended to establish himself as a theocratic king. Joseph Smith Jr., at the time, was a minor candidate for [[President of the United States]].

After Joseph and Hyrum's death, some church leaders campaigned to lead the church during a time known as the [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|Succession Crisis]]. The majority of adherents voted to accept the succession claims presented by the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], led by [[Brigham Young]]. After continued difficulties in Illinois, Brigham Young left Nauvoo in 1846, and led his followers (called the [[Mormon pioneers]] during this period) to what later became [[Utah]] (then part of [[Mexico]]), and began to colonize the area with numerous small cities.

In Utah, Young incorporated The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a legal entity under the laws of the [[Territory of Utah]]. He initially governed his followers as a [[theocracy|theocratic]] leader, and openly encouraged the practice of [[plural marriage]], which Joseph Smith had tried to keep secret. When word of the practice got back to [[Washington, D.C.]], the United States sent federal troops there in 1857, [[Utah War|deposed Young]], and replaced him with [[Alfred Cumming (governor)|a non-Mormon territorial governor]], though Young still wielded significant political power as [[President of the Church (Latter Day Saints)|President of the Church]]. Young was followed by other powerful leaders, who were defiant in the face of U.S. efforts to outlaw polygamous marriages in the territory. Political and legal wrangling over the polygamy issue escalated until 1890, when the church issued a [[1890 Manifesto|Manifesto]] officially suspending the practice. Church relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, and especially after 1904, when church president [[Joseph F. Smith]] [[Reed Smoot hearings|disavowed polygamy]] before the [[United States Congress]] and issued a "Second Manifesto" calling for all polygamous marriages in the church to cease. Since about the 1930s, the church has adopted a policy of [[excommunication|excommunicating]] its members found practicing polygamy.

During the [[20th century]], the Church experienced a period of exponential growth, due to a high birth rate and extensive [[proselytism]]. In 1978, after years of internal discussion within the church hierarchy, the church ended [[Blacks and Mormonism|its practice]], since the days of Brigham Young, of not allowing blacks to hold the priesthood or to participate in temple ceremonies thought necessary for the highest degree of salvation. Since the 1990s, the church's growth rate is no longer exponential, but it continues to gain about 300,000 new members per year. The church has played a prominent role in political matters, supporting [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]], opposing an [[LGM-118A Peacekeeper|MX (Peacekeeper) missile]] base in Utah, opposing the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], opposing legalized [[gambling]], and supporting bans on [[same-sex marriage]],<!--

==Beliefs and practices ==
Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have many beliefs in common with [[Catholic]], [[Orthodox]] and [[Protestant]] traditions, but also some significant departures.  Some of the church's unique beliefs, circa 1842, are discussed in ''[[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)]]''. A comparison between LDS Church doctrine and traditional Christian faiths are discussed in ''[[Mormonism and Christianity]]''. There are also numerous articles discussing [[Latter Day Saint movement]] perspectives on various doctrinal issues, which discuss the specific doctrines of the LDS Church as part of that movement. A summary of the church's major distinctive beliefs and practices are discussed below.

===God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost===

{{main|Godhead (Latter Day Saints)}}

[[Image:Christus statue temple square salt lake city.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Latter-day Saints believe in the resurrected Jesus Christ, as depicted in the Christus Statue in the North Visitors' Center on [[Temple Square]] in [[Salt Lake City]]]] 

The church believe that [[God the Father]], [[Jesus Christ]], and the [[Holy Spirit|Holy Ghost]] are "one God", in the sense that they are one "in purpose", but does not accept the modern Christian creed of [[Trinity]] (established 300 years after Christ's death), that the three are one "in substance". Rather, the church teaches that the Father and the Son are two distinct beings with bodies of flesh and bone but immortal, while the Holy Ghost is a distinct being with a "spirit body".<ref>{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|130|22}}</ref> God the Father is understood to be the father in premortal life of all the spirits who inhabit this earth,<ref>{{lds|Abraham|abr|3|21|26}}, {{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|93|29}}</ref>  and both the spirit father and natural father of Jesus with [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] as his natural mother.  Mormons believe that Jesus was part God and part man, which gave him power over death.

The church embraces Jesus as its central focus, and emphasizes that his suffering in [[Gethsemane]] and on the cross paid for the sins of humanity. The church also believes in the physical [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] of Jesus' body, his body and spirit reunited never to be separated. Because of its emphasis on Jesus' resurrection and his status as the head of the church, the church places less emphasis on Jesus' [[crucifixion]], and does not officially use the symbol of the [[Christian cross]], instead, they focus on Jesus overcoming death and that he lives.

The church follows what it understands to be the teachings of Jesus, both in the ''[[Bible]]'' and in other scriptures, such as the ''[[Book of Mormon]]: Another Testament of Jesus Christ'', which is said to contain the teachings of Jesus to a small group of Jews that left Jerusalem prior to its destruction in 688 BC and populated the ancient Americas. The church also teaches that Jesus is the god [[Tetragrammaton|Jehovah]] of the [[Old Testament]]. Because Jesus is thought to be omniscient and has the same purpose as the Father, the church teaches that Jesus Christ speaks often in the scriptures as though he were the Father, because he is fulfilling the will of the Father.

Official church materials refer to "Heavenly Parents," implying the existence of a Heavenly Mother.<ref>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, [http://lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b3bc55cbf541229058520974e44916a0/?vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=f04a7befabc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&hideNav=1&contentLocale=0 "Chapter 2: Our Heavenly Family"], ''Gospel Principles'', 11 (1997).</ref> Belief in such a figure is common among members, and she has also been mentioned in talks by church officials, as well as in the hymns of the church.<ref>Spencer W. Kimball, [http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b12f9d18fae655bb69095bd3e44916a0/?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=c3ead0640b96b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&hideNav=1 "The True Way of Life and Salvation"], ''Ensign'', May 1978, 4.</ref><ref>''Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'', [http://library.lds.org/nxt/gateway.dll/Curriculum/music.htm/hymns.htm/special%20topics.htm/292%20o%20my%20father.htm#JD_Hymns.292 #292, "O My Father"].</ref> However, no specific doctrine on the subject has been released by the church.

===Apostasy and restoration===
{{main|Restoration (Latter Day Saints)}}

In common with other [[Restorationism|Restorationist]] churches, the church believes in a [[Great Apostasy]]. It teaches that after the death of Christ and the [[Twelve Apostles]], the priesthood authority was lost and some important doctrinal teachings, including the text of the ''[[Bible]]'', were changed from their original form, thus necessitating a [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restoration]] prior to the [[Second Coming]].  That restoration, according to church doctrine, took place during the life of [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], the religion's founder.

The Church teaches that Jesus Christ and God the Father [[Theophany|appeared]] [[First Vision|to Joseph Smith, Jr.]], instructing him to begin the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|reestablishment]] of [[Ministry of Jesus|Christ's Church]] on earth as prophesied in {{lds|Acts|acts|3|19|21}}.  Joseph Smith, Jr. wrote that Christ had called him to be a [[End times|latter-day]] [[Prophet#Latter-day Saint concept of prophets|Prophet]] to tell people of the [[Agape|gospel message]] and restore the [[Priesthood (Mormonism)|authority]] from Christ to [[Ordinance (Mormonism)|perform acts]] in His name.<ref>>{{lds|The Pearl of Great Price, "Joseph Smith - History"|js_h|1|}}</ref>  According to the LDS Church, the unique doctrines taught by the Church are a result of [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelations]] received from God by Joseph Smith, Jr. and his successors.<ref>Gordon B. Hinckley, “The Great Things Which God Has Revealed,” Ensign, May 2005, 80</ref><ref>Thomas S. Monson, “The Prophet Joseph Smith: Teacher by Example,” Ensign, November 2005, 67</ref><ref>James E. Faust, “The Restoration of All Things,” Ensign, May 2006, 61</ref><ref>Boyd K. Packer, “The Standard of Truth Has Been Erected,” Ensign, November 2003, 24</ref><ref>Bruce R. McConkie, “Joseph Smith—The Mighty Prophet of the Restoration,” Ensign, May 1976, 94</ref>

===Priesthood===
{{main|Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)}}
The LDS Church teaches that the authority to act in God's name is called the Priesthood. [[Laity|All worthy male members]] of the Church may hold the Priesthood and are expected to use it righteously to serve and bless their families and others. Holding the priesthood is a stated prerequisite to hold offices within the hierarchy of the church as the Priesthood provides the authority to officiate and preside over the Church, or portions of the Church. The Church further teaches that this authority was given to Joseph Smith by [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]]. Smith was instructed to organize the Church<ref name="intro">[http://www.mormon.org/learn/0,8672,955-1,00.html Introduction to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]. ''Mormon.org.''</ref> and to confer the Priesthood on others. The LDS Church holds [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] as the successor to Joseph Smith Jr. and the person who has the Priesthood authority to preside over and receive revelation for the Church as a whole.

The Church teaches that one such revelation was received by [[Spencer W. Kimball]] in 1978, when he directed that all worthy men be ordained to the priesthood. This changed a long tradition, from 1849 until 1978, that most men of African descent<ref>People of other dark-skinned ethnicities not of [[Africa]]n descent (such as the [[Māori]]) received the priesthood during this time.</ref> were not permitted to receive the priesthood or marry in the temple, although they could become members and hold [[Calling (Mormonism)|callings]] within the Church. See ''[[Blacks and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]'' and ''[[Blacks and Mormonism]]''

Women are partakers of the blessings of the priesthood through their husbands, fathers, and other priesthood holders.  The Church teaches that women cannot receive the Priesthood at this time, but places strong emphasis on the importance of motherhood. Motherhood is considered one of the most sacred responsibilities, and the greatest of callings. The Church also teaches that God listens to and answers the prayers of his daughters.<ref>Gordon B. Hinckley, "How Can I Become the Woman of Whom I Dream?", ''Ensign'', May 2001</ref> The [[feminist movement]] has criticised the fact that women are unable to hold the priesthood.  See ''[[Women and Mormonism]]''

The LDS Church also teaches that the priesthood is divided into two parts: the '''[[Aaronic Priesthood]]''' and the ''[[Melchizedek Priesthood]]''. The Aaronic Priesthood (also called the Levitical Priesthood), is considered to be a lesser priesthood tracing its roots to [[Aaron]] the brother of [[Moses]] through [[John the Baptist]]. [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] and [[Oliver Cowdery]] said that they received this Priesthood on [[May 15]], [[1829]], when they were ordained by [[John the Baptist]].<ref>Messenger and Advocate, 1(1), October 1, 1834.</ref> In 1835, Smith and Cowdery clarified that this authority was the "Aaronic, or Levitical priesthood".<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|3|2}}.</ref> 

The Melchizedek Priesthood, or, the "Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God"<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|3}}</ref> is recognized as a "higher" order of priesthood, or the [[High Priest (Mormonism)|"high priesthood"]] and takes its name from [[Melchizedek]] who "was such a great high priest".<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|3|1}}.</ref> This priesthood was thought to be the order of priesthood held by [[Jesus]], and a distinction is made between the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods, which derives in part from the ''[[Epistle to the Hebrews]]'', whose author argues that [[Jesus]] arose "after the order of Melchizedek, and not...after the order of Aaron."<ref>{{lds|Heb|heb|7|11}}</ref>

===Ordinances===
{{main|Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)}}
[[Image:Salt Lake temple baptismal font.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Baptismal font in the [[Salt Lake Temple]], circa 1912, where [[baptism for the dead|baptisms for the dead]] were performed by proxy. The font rests on the backs of twelve oxen representing the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel]]]] 

Latter-day Saint [[Sacrament]]s are called [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|''ordinances'']], and there are two types: saving ordinances and non-saving ordinances. Saving ordinances are those required for [[salvation]], and include [[baptism]] (by immersion), [[confirmation]] (laying on of hands for the gift of the [[Holy Spirit]]), ordination to an office of the [[priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] (for males), the [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|Endowment]], [[Sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealing]], and arguably the [[Second Anointing]] (which is rarely given). Non-saving ordinances include various kinds of blessings, the "[[Sacrament (Latter Day Saints)|sacrament]]" (the Latter-day Saint version of the [[Eucharist]] or Communion)(taken each Sunday) in which adherents renew the covenants that they made at baptism and start out the next week clean, the dedication of graves, the dedication of buildings, the [[prayer circle]], the [[Hosanna Shout]], and the washing of dust from the feet against one's enemies (very rare). All ordinances must be performed by a man ordained to the appropriate [[priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] office, with the exception of certain parts of the Endowment and Second Anointing ordinances, which are performed by "endowed" women in their role as "priestesses".

The church teaches that to obtain the highest degree of [[salvation]] (referred to as "exaltation" or the Celestial Kingdom), all people who have lived past the age of eight must participate in each of the saving ordinances, either in person or by proxy after they are dead. Therefore, church members participate in the saving ordinances on behalf of dead relatives and others whose names have been extracted from historical records. These proxy ordinances are one of the functions of the church's [[Temple (Latter Day Saint)|temples]].  Additional ordinances performed are the live endowment, and sealing or eternal marriage.

Other than sealings, the church does not perform saving ordinances for those younger than age eight (they are not considered to be at the age of accountability) or who have died before the age of eight, church doctrine states that these are made alive in Christ. In particular, the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'' forbids [[infant baptism]], and states that children who die before becoming accountable for their sins are automatically saved by the grace of Jesus.<ref>See {{lds|Moroni|moro|8|4|23}}; {{lds|D&C|dc|68|27}}.</ref>

===Purpose of life===
{{main|Plan of Salvation}}

The term ''[[Plan of Salvation]]'' is used by the LDS Church to describe how the gospel of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] is designed to bring about the immortality and eternal life of mankind.<ref>See also {{lds|Moses|moses|1|39}}.</ref>

The Church teaches that prior to being born, everyone on earth lived with Heavenly Father (God) as his spirit child.<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|93|29}}</ref><ref>{{lds|Moses|3|5}}</ref>  After progressing up to a certain point, further learning and progress was not possible without taking on a mortal body and going through trials while largely separated from God's presence and influence.   All those born on this earth were the ones who endorsed Christ's offer to facilitate God's [[Plan of Salvation]] involving free-agency as opposed to a plan of forced obedience.  As a condition of being born into mortality, a veil that blocks the memories of the pre-mortal life facilitates the exercise of free-agency as well as test the humility and faith of each individual.  In confirming this, the [[Book of Mormon]] teaches "...this life [is] a probationary state; a time to prepare to meet God..."(Alma 12:24).

Further encapsulating the purpose of life are the verses taken from the [[Book of Abraham]] where the Creator says:
“...We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell; And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;”<ref>See {{lds|Abraham|3|24-25}}</ref>

The Church teaches that all will be [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrected]] and receive  [[immortality]] as a gift made possible by Jesus' death and [[resurrection]].<ref>See {{lds|1 Corinthians|1_cor|15|22}}</ref>

The church also teaches that prior to resurrection, the spirits of those who die will await their resurrection in either Spirit prison, or spirit paradise.

Following the resurrection all will be [[Last Judgment|judged]] by Jesus Christ. As part of this judgment, each person will be assigned to one of three heavenly kingdoms (sometimes called [[Degrees of Glory]]): the [[Celestial Kingdom]],<ref>See {{lds|Romans|rom|8|17}}</ref> the [[Terrestrial Kingdom]],<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|76|74}}</ref> and the [[Telestial Kingdom]].<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|76|110}}</ref>
 
The Church also teaches that those people who have not had an opportunity to hear the doctrines of Jesus Christ during life on Earth will have had the opportunity to do so prior to the judgment through missionary work that goes on beyond the veil.  Upon Christ's death it is believed that he visited spirit paradise and taught the gospel to those that awaited him, and that there are those in paradise that have been assigned to go and preach the gospel among those in spirit prison.

===Eschatology===
Latter-day Saints teach [[Millennialism]], in which, after a period of [[tribulation]], the [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus]] will occur, followed by a [[millennium|thousand years]] of peace, after which will occur the [[Last Judgment]]. Distinctive within Latter-day millennialism, however, is the idea that [[Jesus]] will reign "personally upon the earth" ({{lds|Article of Faith|a_of_f|1|10}}), and direct the government or governments that will exist.<ref>Berrett, William E, Teachings of the Doctrine and Covenants, 1956, Ch. 42, p.280</ref> [[Jackson County, Missouri]] is expected to have an important LDS temple during the Millennium, as well as [[Jerusalem]] is expected to be an important center of government in the world.<ref>Brewster, Hoyt W, Isaiah Plain and Simple: The Message of Isaiah in the Book of Mormon, 1995, Ch. 2, p.10-13</ref> As the earth transitions into the Millennial period, only those good and honorable people who stand to inherit the [[Celestial Kingdom]] will continue on the earth completing the work of the dead that all may be resurrected prior to the time of judgement.

===Theology of family and gender===
{{see also |Eternal Marriage|The Family: A Proclamation to the World|Family Home Evening}}

The LDS Church teaches that, through the [[Ordinance (Mormonism)|ordinances]] of the restored gospel, families can be [[Sealing (Mormonism)|sealed]Married] together so that spouses may remain together after death and live together eternally. Not only do spouses live together forever,  LDS doctrine also teaches that children continue in that familial bond in the afterlife; only marriages and sealings performed in LDS temples will continue after death.  Therefore, the Church teaches that all who qualify will be sealed by proxy where living people are sealed vicariously on behalf of those that have died without being sealed. 

Because of these beliefs, the LDS Church places a strong emphasis on the importance of the family to individuals and society. In particular, the Church views the [[nuclear family]] (father, mother and children) as the most important single unit in the Church, as well as in society. In [[1995]], the [[First Presidency]] and the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] published ''[[The Family: A Proclamation to the World]]'', a document explaining major LDS doctrine concerning the family. LDS Church leaders and doctrine support the traditional definitions of family and marriage, including opposing same-sex marriage<ref>[http://lds.org/newsroom/showrelease/0,15503,4028-1-23860,00.html ''First Presidency letter to Church leaders, 1994''], The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</ref> and supporting the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]].<ref>LDS.org Newsroom. {{cite web | url=http://www.lds.org/newsroom/showrelease/0,15503,4028-1-23253,00.html | title=Church Supports Call for Constitutional Amendment|accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref>

In the early part of the 20th century, Church members were counseled to set aside [[Monday]] night as a time to dedicate to their own families. No other church meetings were to be held on this night. The Church still encourages members to meet Monday nights in a ''[[Family Home Evening]]'' to pray, read scriptures, and engage in other recreational activities that encourage family togetherness.

=== Donations of time and service ===  
{{See also|Perfection (Latter Day Saints)}}   
''See also [[#Worship and Culture|Worship and Culture]] below''
   
Latter-day Saints have a high degree of participation outside of worship services. Active church membership can entails missionary work, family history, participation in church callings, [[Family Home Evening]], and payment of [[tithe]]s and other free will offerings. Other forms of charity are encouraged, including donations of money, clothing and time. The Church teaches its members should be self sufficient and avoid falling into debt.<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|104|78}}</ref><ref>Benson, Ezra Taft. "Pay Thy Debt, and Live." ''Ensign''. June 1987: p. 3. {{cite web | url=http://library.lds.org/nxt/gateway.dll/Magazines/Ensign/1987.htm/ensign%20june%201987.htm/first%20presidency%20message%20pay%20thy%20debt%20and%20live%20.htm | title=Available online. | accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref>    
    
The ''[[tithe|Law of Tithing]]'' states that members are expected to give 10% of their income to the Church. These funds are used to build meetinghouses and other buildings, to cover operating costs, education, produce materials for use in church classes and organizations, support the missionary program, and to support family history work and other church functions.<ref>[http://www.mormon.org/learn/0,8672,1095-1,00.html The law of tithing]. ''Mormon.org''.</ref>   
    
''[[Fast offering]]s'' (named for their collection each month after [[fasting]] for two meals) are generally expected to be a minimum of the cost of food for the monthly day of fast practiced by members and go towards [[humanitarian aid]], including assisting the needy to become self-reliant. Payment of generous fast offerings is highly recommended.<ref>[Victor L. Brown, “Fast Offerings: Fulfilling Our Responsibility to Others,” Ensign, May 1981, 37]</ref>

===Lifestyle code===
The  [[Word of Wisdom]] is a health guideline encouraging healthy eating and discouraging the unhealthy addictive use of alcohol, tobacco, coffee and tea.  It was originally given as a warning with a promise of health, but in 1851, it was given as a commandment.<ref>Doctrine and Covenants section 89</ref> It is a requirement to obey the laws of the country in which the member lives. 

The [[law of chastity]] teaches sexual [[abstinence]] before marriage and [[fidelity]] after marriage.  Members should learn to control their thoughts and desires and avoid doing anything that may arouse inappropriate sexual feelings, such as masturbating, viewing pornography or participating in any forms of sexual intimacy with anyone besides their spouse.<ref name=Chasity>[http://lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.3933737ad2ff28132eb22a86942826a0/?vgnextoid=bbd508f54922d010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&sourceId=23e80bbce1d98010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____ Gospel topics, Chasity]</ref>  They should be modest in dress and appearance. The church condemns abortion, but members may procure an abortion without repercussion in the case of rape or incest. 

Church members who fail to live the commandments, in more serious cases (such as the commission of felonies, infidelity, abortion, drug use, or apostasy) may be subject to church disciplinary action including [[disfellowshipment]] or even [[excommunication]] as part of the repentance process.  Such individuals are encouraged to continue attending church services, but are not permitted to hold callings or offer public prayer at any church meeting (although personal prayer is encouraged) nor can excommunicated members  pay tithing. Other members are frequently unaware of the status of such individuals.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Ensign

===Homosexuality and Mormonism===
{{main|Homosexuality and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
President [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] told reporters: “Now we have gays in the church.  Good people.  We take no action against such people – provided they don’t become involved in transgression, [[Law of Chastity|sexual transgression]].  If they do, we do with them exactly what we’d do with heterosexuals who transgress.”<ref name=SanJoseInterview> [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1997/04/13/SC36289.DTL  Lattin, Don (1997) Musings of the Main Mormon] </ref>

Homosexuals are expected to keep the same [[law of chastity]] as heterosexuals, which includes learning to control inappropriate thoughts, desires and feelings, sexual abstinence before marriage, and fidelity afterwards.  If they do, they can “go forward as do all other members of the church.”<ref>Hinckley, G. (1998, November).

===Origin of Native Americans===
{{main|Book of Mormon}}
Latter-day Saints believe in a covenant relationship between God and the House of Israel, as described in the Old Testament.<ref>Smith, Joseph Fielding, Doctrines of Salvation, Vol. 3, Ch. 13 (pp. 244-264)</ref> As stated in the introduction to the [[Book of Mormon]], they believe that [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] are included in this covenant, and that some are descended from members of two of the [[Lost Tribes of Israel]] (the tribes of Ephraim & Manasseh) that migrated to the Americas shortly before the destruction of [[Jerusalem]] in 586 BC, and also from another group of Israelites that migrated after the city's fall.  A portion of The Book of Mormon also contains the records of people that migrated to the America shortly after the tower of babel. 



===America as Promised Land===
A more expansive view of the Americas as a covenant land for people of whatever origin whose ancestors have been led by the "hand of the Lord" to settle there is included in Lehi's prophecy in the Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 1:5-7:  "Yea, the Lord hath covenanted this land unto me, and to my children forever, and also all those who should be led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord... That there shall none come into this land save they shall be brought by the hand of the Lord.  Wherefore, this land is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring... Unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever."

===Africans and Mormonism===
[[Image:Hmartins.jpg|thumb|125px|Elder [[Helvécio Martins]] was the first black general authority]]
{{main|Blacks and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
The controversy regarding Blacks and Mormonism has begun to be dissipated since the 1978 revelation announced by letter on June 8 under the direction of LDS President Spencer W. Kimball.  The letter stated that "the long-promised day has come when every faithful, worthy man in the Church may receive the holy priesthood, with power to exercise its divine authority, and enjoy with his loved ones every blessing that flows therefrom, including the blessings of the temple." (Doctrine and Covenants, Official Declaration 2)  Prior to this, not all men of African descent were permitted to receive the priesthood. (see www.blackmormon.org)<ref>Dark-skinned men from other locations, such as the Māori of New Zealand, could hold the priesthood.</ref> This revelation helped to fulfill what Mormons believe was a promise to Abraham: "thou shalt be a blessing unto thy seed after thee, that in their hands they shall bear this ministry and Priesthood unto all nations; ...and in thy seed after thee ...shall all the families of the earth be blessed, even with the blessings of the Gospel, which are the blessings of salvation, even of life eternal." (Abraham 2:9,11)

== Sacred texts and other publications ==
[[Image:Latter-day Saint Scripture Quadruple Combination.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Standard Works]] of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints printed in the ''Quadruple Combination'' format]]

The Church accepts as [[biblical canon|canon]]: the ''[[Bible]]'',<ref>See the Ninth [[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)|Article of Faith]] (lds|A of F|a_of_f|1|9}}</ref> the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'', the ''[[Doctrine and Covenants]]'' and the ''[[Pearl of Great Price (Latter Day Saints)|Pearl of Great Price]].'' The four are considered the ''[[Standard Works]]''. The church also publishes numerous periodicals, manuals, and sometimes "proclamations", which are not scripture, but clarify its teachings.

===Holy Bible===
{{see also|Bible}}
The church has articulated its position on the ''[[Bible]]'', in the words of Joseph Smith, Jr. "We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly".<ref>See the Ninth [[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)|Article of Faith]] (lds|A of F|a_of_f|1|9}}</ref> Smith used the ''[[King James Version of the Bible]]'' (KJV), but considered the [[Bible translations|translation]] to have omissions and mistranslations; thus he began the ''[[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]]'' (sometimes called the ''Inspired Version'').  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day saints uses the King James version of the bible.

===Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ===
[[Image:Book of Mormon English Missionary Edition Soft Cover.jpg|left|thumb|150px|The church's latest edition of the ''[[Book of Mormon]]: Another Testament of Jesus Christ'']]
{{main|Book of Mormon}}
The ''[[Book of Mormon]]: Another Testament of Jesus Christ'' is also considered canon. The book is named after one of the prophet/historians, [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]], who, according to the text compiled most of the book onto gold plates. It was first published by [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] in March 1830 in [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra, New York]].  The book describes itself as being written by ancient [[prophet]]s of the [[Western Hemisphere]] who traveled there from ancient [[Israel]] circa 600 BC. The church teaches that the [[Golden Plates|gold plates]] were delivered to him by [[angel Moroni|an angel]], and that Smith translated the record by divine inspiration with assistance from the [[Urim and Thummim]]. Joseph Smith Jr. said he returned the plates to the angel, identified as [[angel Moroni|Moroni]].

===Doctrine and Covenants===
{{Main|Doctrine and Covenants}}
First Published in 1835, ''The Doctrine and Covenants'' is a collection of modern day revelations, policies, letters, and statements given to the Church, mostly by Joseph Smith. This record contains Church doctrine as well as direction on Church government.  It is also considered to be canon.

===Pearl of Great Price===
{{Main|Pearl of Great Price (Latter Day Saints)}}
''The Pearl of Great Price'' is a compilation of several books.  The "[[Book of Moses]]".  The "[[Book of Abraham]]" was derived from Egyptian papyrus that came into Smith's possession in 1835.<ref>Peterson, H Donl, Story of the Book of Abraham, 1995, Ch. 19</ref>  "[[Joseph Smith&mdash;History]]" is an excerpt from ''The Documentary History of the Church'' containing a letter written by Joseph Smith in 1838.  Lastly, the "[[Articles of Faith]]" is an excerpt from [[The Wentworth Letter|another of Smith's letters]] which contain thirteen statements of belief and doctrine.<ref>See {{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1}}</ref> The Pearl of Great Price completes the church's canon.

===Non-canonical publications===
[[Image:77245_April2006Ensign_tn.jpg|right|thumb|The [[May]] [[2006]] issue of [[Ensign (magazine)|Ensign]] magazine, featuring [[Gordon B. Hinckley]], current President of the Church.]]
The ''[[Ensign (magazine)|Ensign]]'' is an official [[magazine]] of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The magazine was first issued in January 1971 along with the ''[[New Era (magazine)|New Era]]'' (for youth) and the ''[[The Friend (Mormon magazine)|Friend]]'' (for children), all of which replaced the older church publications ''[[Improvement Era]]'', ''[[Relief Society Magazine]]'', ''[[The Children's Friend (LDS magazine)|The Children's Friend]]'', ''[[The Instructor]]'', and the ''[[Millennial Star]]''. Unlike some of its predecessors, the ''Ensign'' contains no [[Advertising|advertisements]]. Content includes faith-promoting and proselytizing information, stories, and sermons.<ref>The full text and page layout of past and current issues are available on the Church's web site.{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/gospellibrary/pdfindex/0,7777,579-1,00.html|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|title=Church Publications}}</ref>

Semiannually, the ''Ensign'' gives a full report of the proceedings of the annual and semi-annual [[LDS General Conference]]s of the Church.  It contains the full text of the talks and business of the conferences, as well as a current photographic list of the highest officers of the Church, referred to as the [[General Authority|General Authorities]].

''[[Liahona]]'' is also the name of the official international magazine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, named after an object used to guide the people in the Book of Mormon. The ''Liahona'' is regularly published in fifty different languages, from two to twelve times a year depending on the language. It contains material that is mostly for adults and is translated from articles in the ''Ensign'' magazine. It also contains stories from the [[New Era]] and [[The Friend (Mormon magazine)|Friend]] for readers of the respective age groups.

[[Deseret Management Corporation]], a for-profit company which is owned by the church operates several companies which publish material:
* [[Deseret Book]]. Deseret Book is independently managed and publishes under four imprints and different media. Published materials include: doctrinal non-fiction books, [[LDS fiction]] books, electronic resources and sound recordings. Deseret Book also owns a chain of LDS [[bookstores]] in the western United States. 
* ''[[Deseret Morning News]]''. Utah's second largest daily newspaper is published in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] and is [[Utah]]'s oldest continually published daily newspaper. The newspaper is printed by [[Newspaper Agency Corporation]], which it co-owns with the ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'' under a [[joint operating agreement]]. ''Deseret News'' also publishes a weekly publication, the ''LDS Church News'', which is included each Saturday and distributed by mail as a separate publication outside Utah.
* [[Bonneville International]] owns and independently manages 1 television and over 30 radio stations in 8 cities within the [[United States]].

== Worship and Culture ==
[[Image:LDS_Chapel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The chapel in the [[Joseph Smith Memorial Building]] in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]. Although within a downtown office building, it still follows the standard design of LDS chapels throughout the world.]]
===Worship services=== 
{{main|Worship services of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}

Weekly worship services, including sacrament meetings, are held on Sundays (or Saturday when local custom or law prohibits Sunday worship), in neighborhood-based religious units, and twice each year the Church holds a worldwide General Conference.  [[congregation (worship)|Congregations]] for Sunday services are grouped geographically, with larger (~200 to ~400 people) congregations known as [[Ward (Mormonism)|wards]], and smaller (two through ~200 people) congregations known as branches.  These neighborhood congregations meet in meetinghouses, also referred to as "chapels" or "stake centers", on property most often owned by the Church.  In some geographic areas, rental property may be used as a meetinghouse.  Although the building may sometimes be referred to as a "chapel", the room used as a chapel for religious services is actually only one component of the standard meetinghouse.<ref>[http://www.mormon.org/virtualchapel/virtualchapel.html A church-maintained virtual tour of a typical meetinghouse]</ref>

All persons, regardless of their beliefs or their standing in or out of the Church, are allowed to attend.<ref>[http://www.mormon.org/question/worship/1,8578,797-1,00.html Open invitation to attend church, on Church-maintained website]</ref> The [[Sacrament (Mormonism)|sacrament]] (similar to Communion, the Lord's Supper, or the [[Eucharist]] in other churches) is offered weekly to the members of the church. Except on Mondays, which are reserved for [[Family Home Evening]], members meet in meetinghouses for various activities throughout the week.

Women usually attend wearing skirts or dresses, while men wear suits or dress shirts (preferably white) and ties.  Children are also typically in their "Sunday best."<ref>Mormon.org. {{cite web | url=http://mormon.org/book/0,9768,826-1,00.html | title=What to expect at Sunday meetings | accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref>

=== Temple worship ===

{{main|Temple (Latter Day Saints)}}

Two years after the organization of the Church, in 1832, Joseph Smith, Jr., reported receiving a revelation that called upon church members to build a ''House of the Lord'' to restore the practice of temple worship.<ref>[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/124/47,51,72,145#31 Doctrine & Covenants 124:31]</ref> The Church built its [[Kirtland Temple|first temple]] in [[Kirtland, Ohio|Kirtland]], [[Ohio]] in 1836.  This temple was used primarily for instruction and learning.<ref>Encyclopedia of Mormonism, Vol.2, KIRTLAND TEMPLE</ref>

[[Image:363px-Bern Tempel 20 Jan 1981.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Bern Switzerland Temple]], dedicated in 1955, was the first LDS temple in Europe]]
In 1846 the [[Nauvoo Temple]] was built in [[Nauvoo]], [[Illinois]].  With this temple came the introduction of special ordinances, such as the [[Endowment (Mormonism)|endowment]] and [[baptism for the dead]].<ref>Encyclopedia of Mormonism, Vol.3, NAUVOO TEMPLE — ''see'' [[Ordinance (Mormonism)]]</ref>  When the saints moved West to Utah, they were forced to abandon these temples.  The Nauvoo temple was destroyed by fire and the Kirtland temple is owned by the [[Community of Christ]].  

Soon after the arrival of the Saints in the Rocky Mountains, they began building several temples, including the well known [[Salt Lake Temple]], which took more than 40 years to complete.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/newsroom/showpackage/0,15367,3899-1---2-119,00.html |title=Granite and Faith: The Story of the Salt Lake Temple |accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref> The Church continued to build temples as membership grew. {{LDS Temple status}}  ''See [[List of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]''.

Today faithful members of the Church are encouraged to regularly attend [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temples]] and participate in [[Ordinance (Mormonism)|ordinances]] there, such as [[baptism for the dead]]. The Church teaches that certain temple ordinances, including being married in the temple, are necessary for eternal exaltation. The Church also regards the temples as places of peace and refuge that are set apart from the world. Adult members who have performed a temple ordinance called an [[Endowment (Mormonism)|endowment]] also receive a [[Temple garment (Mormonism)|temple garment]], which they wear under their daily clothing.  The Church considers the temple ordinances exceptionally sacred and does not discuss them publicly. Non-members or members without a temple recommend are not permitted to attend or observe these ordinances. For a member to receive a temple recommend they must be worthy. However, the general public, member or non member, is invited to attend an open house of the temple prior to its dedication.

===General Conference===
{{main|General conference (Mormonism)}}

Twice a year (Spring and Autumn), the Church holds [[General conference (Mormonism)|General Conference]], in which the Prophet and other leaders speak from [[Temple Square]] in Salt Lake City, Utah.  These talks, given in several sessions over two days, are carried worldwide by radio, television, satellite and Internet broadcasts.  They are translated into numerous languages, and are later made available on DVD (complete with translations) and also printed in Church publications such as [[Ensign (magazine)|Ensign]] and [[Liahona]].  Attendees come from around the world.

[[Image:LDS Conference Center interior panoramic.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Interior of the [[LDS Conference Center]] where the Church holds its semi-annual [[General Conference (Mormonism)|General Conference]]]]

Conference talks address doctrinal topics drawn from scriptures and personal experiences, messages of faith and hope, Church history and information on the Church as it expands throughout the world.  

Throughout the 20th century, Conference talks were given from the [[Salt Lake Tabernacle]].  With a maximum capacity of about 8,000 per session, the Tabernacle would be filled and thousands of other attendees would sit on blankets on Temple Square lawns.  In 2001, the [[LDS Conference Center]] was opened, and since that time talks have been given in the Center's 22,000-seat main auditorium.

Conference satellite broadcasts may be watched, live, in thousands of chapels worldwide.  The public is invited to attend General Conference, either through these broadcasts, in the Conference Center or other areas at Temple Square.

===Culture===
{{Main article |Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
Due to the differences in lifestyle promoted by church doctrine and history, a distinct culture has grown up around members of the Church. It is primarily concentrated in the [[Rocky Mountains]], but as membership of the Church spreads around the world, many of its more distinctive practices, such as following the [[Word of Wisdom]], a health code prohibiting the consumption of [[tobacco]], [[alcohol]], [[coffee]] and [[tea]], and other addictive substances, follow.<ref>See Doctrine & Covenants, Section 89.</ref>  Because of the prohibition on such things as tobacco and alcohol, the culture in high Mormon populations reflects these restrictions.<ref>[http://www.sltrib.com/ci_4903619]. Salt Lake Tribune Editorial, ''Liquor stores: Banning phone listings, stores won't stop abuse''.</ref> The Church discourages gambling in all forms, including [[lottery|lotteries]].<ref>[http://www.lds.org/conference/talk/display/0,5232,89-1-520-21,00.html Gambling]. Gordon B. Hinckley, ''The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''.</ref>

Meetings and outreach programs are held regularly and have become part of the Latter-day Saint culture.

====Young men and women====
{{main|Young Men Organization}}
{{main|Young Women Organization}}
Young men and women aged 12 to 18 often have an additional meeting during the week (referred to as Mutual or (previously) MIA, which are short for ''Mutual Improvement Association''), which can involve an activity, game, service project, or instruction. The young men and women may meet separately or take part in a combined activities. Usually, the young men participate in [[Boy Scouts of America|Scouting]], including efforts to gain the [[religious emblems programs (Boy Scouts of America)|Duty to God]] award and an award unique to the LDS Church, "On my Honor." Young women participate in a program titled [[Personal Progress]]. Both the young men and the young women try to live by the standards outlined in [[For the Strength of Youth]].

====Institute of Religion====

{{main|Institute of Religion}}

There are several LDS Institutes of Religion in the United States which are mostly close to colleges and universities. There are several religion classes which are offered for free in these institutes. Besides that, it is a place for young students to associate with other young Latter-day Saints and have activities.

====Home, family, and personal enrichment====
Four times a year the adult women (members of the Church's [[Relief Society]]) attend a Home, Family, and Personal Enrichment Meeting (formerly known as Homemaking Meeting). The meeting may consist of a service project, or of attending a social event, or of various classes being offered. In addition, Enrichment activities are offered (weekly, monthly, or as determined by ward Relief Society leaders) for women with similar needs and interests.

====Social events and gatherings====
[[Image:PSP 028.jpg|thumb|LDS stake center. Stake centers serve as meetinghouses for local congregations and headquarters for the local stake.]]
In addition to these regularly scheduled meetings, additional meetings are frequently held at the meetinghouse. Auxiliary officers may conduct leadership meetings or host training sessions and classes.  The ward or branch community may schedule social activities at the meetinghouse, including dances, dinners, holiday parties and musical presentations.  Other popular activities are basketball, family history conferences, youth and singles conferences, dances and various personal improvement classes. Church members may also reserve the building for personal or family use, to accommodate such events as music recitals, family reunions, weddings and receptions, birthdays, or funerals.

====Media Community====
The culture has created substantial business opportunities for LDS media. The largest of these communities are [[LDS cinema]], and LDS Fiction, LDS websites, and LDS graphical art like photography and paintings. The church owns a bookstore called [[Deseret Book]] which provides an avenue for much of this media to be sold. This culture also resides outside of heavily mormon populations and many LDS bookstores exist near many temples where many members commonly visit. Some of the titles that have become popular outside of the LDS community are the "Work and the Glory" series of novels, and "Other Side of Heaven" movie. There are a number of titles that have become huge successes within the LDS community. These titles generally elaborate on LDS culture or historical fiction in some manner.

--> There were several alternate spellings in use during Smith's lifetime, however, including a hyphenated "Latter-Day".  After Smith died, [[Brigham Young]] and the largest body of Smith's followers retained the name, and when this body was incorporated as a church in 1851 by legislation of the [[State of Deseret]],<ref>The initial incorporation by the non-existent [[State of Deseret]][http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/uthisstat&CISOPTR=1756&REC=4] was not legally valid, but was soon ratified by the [[Territory of Utah]] in 1851[http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=%2Futhisstat&CISOPTR=448&REC=3&CISOBOX=church+of+jesus+christ+of+latter-day+saints] and 1855. See ''Late Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v.

The Church is also known as the ''LDS Church'' and the ''Mormon Church''. Church members are known as ''Mormons'' or ''Latter-day Saints'', both being appellations accepted among Latter-day Saints themselves. The nickname "[[Mormon]]" arose soon after the publication of ''[[The Book of Mormon]]'' in 1830. Although originally used by those who tried to destroy the church and implement the extermination order, the term came to be used widely within the Church.

The Church requests that the official name, ''The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'', be used where possible, stating: "This full name was given by revelation from God to Joseph Smith in 1838."<ref name="styleguide">[http://www.lds.org/newsroom/page/0,15606,3899-1---15-168,00.html A style guide] issued by the Church in 2001</ref> It also encourages the use of "the Church" or "the Church of Jesus Christ" as shortened references, although "LDS Church" is commonly used within the Church's own publications and the Church officially uses "Mormon" as a descriptive term for itself in the name of the ''[[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]]'' and the website [http://mormon.org ''mormon.org'']. When referring to members of the Church, it suggests "Latter-day Saints" as preferred, although "Mormons" is acceptable.<ref name="styleguide" /> Despite these efforts, the [[Associated Press]] continues to recommend "Mormon Church" as a proper second reference in its ''Style Guide'' for journalists, and the church itself uses "Mormon Church" on some of its websites.
<!--This is important to the terms used within the article and other articles in the Wikipedia:WikiProject Latter Day Saints. -->

=== Legal entities ===
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was formally incorporated in 1851. That corporation, however, was dissolved by an act of the [[United States Congress]] in 1887 because of the church's practice (now abandoned) of [[polygamy]]. Thereafter, the church has continued to operate as an "unincorporated religious association". However, the church has organized several tax-exempt corporations to assist with the transfer of money and capital. These include the ''Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'', organized in 1916 under the laws of the state of [[Utah]] to acquire, hold, and dispose of [[real property]]. In 1923, the church incorporated the ''Corporation of the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'' in [[Utah]] to receive and manage money and church donations. In 1997, the church incorporated [[Intellectual Reserve|Intellectual Reserve, Inc.]] to hold all the church's [[copyright]]s, [[trademark]]s, and other [[intellectual property]].

=== Priesthood hierarchy ===
The Church has a hierarchical structure, with clearly defined stewardships or realms of responsibility for the various offices. Those who hold such offices do not elect to do so but are "called" by someone of a higher authority, all are laymen and are not paid for their service.

[[image:Hinckley_message.jpg|right|framed|[[Gordon B. Hinckley]] is regarded by church members as [[God]]'s [[prophet]] upon the Earth today.]] 	 
The leader of the Church is termed [[President of the Church (Latter Day Saints)|President]], and church members revere him as a [[Prophet, Seer, and Revelator]]. The prophet is believed to hold the same divine calling as biblical prophets, and his stewardship is over the Church as a whole. He is entitled to guide the church through revelation, acting as God's veritable mouthpiece.  The President of the Church serves as such until death. Historically, the senior apostle has always become the new President of the Church. The current President is [[Gordon B. Hinckley]].

The [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve]] [[Apostle (Mormonism)|Apostles]], the [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|Presiding Bishopric]] and the [[Seventy (Latter Day Saints)|First and Second Quorums of the Seventy]] are all referred to as ''[[General Authorities]]'' because they direct the work of the entire church throughout the world. The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are sustained as [[prophets, seers, and revelators]]. 

Other church authorities are referred to as ''area authorities'' and ''local authorities'' and include all other [[Quorums of the Seventy]], [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission Presidents]], [[Stake (Mormonism)|Stake Presidents]], [[bishop]]s, and other [[Quorum (Mormonism)|quorum]] presidents. 

The Church has no salaried ministry; however, General Authorities who demonstrate need might receive a stipend from the Church, using income from Church-owned investments.<ref>Ludlow, Daniel H., Latter-day Prophets Speak: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Church Presidents, 1948/1993, Ch. 32</ref> All area and local authorities, as well as holders of all other positions, are [[Laity|unpaid]] and continue in their normal occupations while serving in leadership positions.

The Church teaches that revelation from God continues today, but only as far as one's own stewardship is concerned. Accordingly, revelation to direct the entire Church comes to the prophet; revelation to direct a [[Stake (Mormonism)|stake]] comes to the stake president; for a [[Ward (Mormonism)|ward]], to the bishop, and so forth. Latter-day Saints also believe that individuals can receive personal revelation or divine guidance in raising their families and managing their life affairs. Because of their belief in modern revelation, Latter-day Saints give significant weight to the teachings of their church leaders. They revere the words their prophets and [[General authority|general authorities]] speak, when "moved upon by the Holy Ghost",<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|8|3|4}}. Members are encouraged to listen carefully to [[general conference (Mormonism)|general conference]] but also feel they can rely on personal revelation in order to appreciate validity of such statements. (see Joseph F. Smith, in Conference Report, April 1902, and [http://library.lds.org/nxt/gateway.dll/Magazines/Ensign/1981.htm/ensign%20november%201981.htm/conference%20time.htm Howard W. Hunter] in Conference Report, October 1981.)</ref> as modern-day scripture, and members are encouraged to ponder and pray for revelation regarding the truthfulness of such statements.

===Relief Society and women's status===   

{{main|Relief Society}}   
   
The Relief Society is the women's organization of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Founded in 1842 in [[Nauvoo]], [[Illinois]], and with the motto "Charity Never Faileth", the organization today includes more than 5 million women in over 165 countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/newsroom/showpackage/0,15367,3899-1--43-2-125,00.html|publisher=newsroom.lds.org|title=From Pioneer Group to Worldwide Society}}</ref> 

The status of women in church leadership has remained largely unchanged since the early [[1900s]]. Although they are not ordained to the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Priesthood]], preaching and instruction by women is an integral part of weekly Latter-day Saint worship. Certain leadership positions are filled only by women, and in some of the Church's auxiliary organizations women may preside over men, such as in the [[Primary (Mormonism)|Primary]] and the [[Young Women Organization]], in welfare programs, at a [[Family History Library]], and so forth. Since the 1840s, women have officiated in certain [[ordinance (Mormonism)|ordinances]] (sacred rites) that take place inside [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temples]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mormon.org/learn/0,8672,1588-1,00.html |title= Women and the priesthood |accessdate=2006-11-05 |work=[http://mormon.org/ Mormon.org] |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints }}</ref>

===Current membership===
The Church reports a worldwide membership of 12,868,606<ref>[http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/6600AP_UT_Mormon_Conference_Stats.html]</ref> (as of December 31, 2006) with approximately 6.7 million residing outside the United States. According to these statistics it is the fourth largest religious body in the United States.<ref>[http://www.electronicchurch.org ''2005 Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches''], National Council of Churches.  See article by [http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001481.html Information Please® Database], Pearson Education, Inc.</ref> The Church membership report includes all baptized members, and also "children of record" - unbaptized children under the age of eight. (Children are not baptized before the age of eight.)  Members living in the US and [[Canada]] constitute 47% of membership, [[Latin America]] 36%, and members in the rest of the world 17%. (See [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints/Membership history|growth history]]). A Survey by the [[City College of New York]] in [[2001]] extrapolated that there were 2,787,000 self-identified LDS adults in the [[United States]] in 2001, an increase of 1.3% over their [[1991]] survey, making the LDS Church the 10th-largest religious body in their phone survey of over 50,000 households.<ref>{{cite web | title=American Religious Identification Survey | work=cuny.edu | url=http://www.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/research_briefs/aris/key_findings.htm | author=Egon Mayer, Ph.D.; Barry A. Kosmin, Ph.D.; Ariela Keysar, Ph.D. | accessdate=2006-07-27 }}</ref>

===Finances===
[[Image:Lds church administration building.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Church Administration Building with the [[LDS Church Office Building]] tower in the background]]
{{main|Finances of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}} 
The Church receives most of its funding from [[tithe]]s and ''[[fast offering]]s''. About ten percent of its funding also comes from income on its investments and real estate holdings.<ref>[http://mormoninquiry.typepad.com/mormon_inquiry/2004/10/lds_revenues_an.html Mormon Inquiry article]</ref> 

The Church uses most of its financial resources to construct and maintain buildings and other facilities. The Church also spends much of its funds on providing social welfare and relief and supporting missionary, educational, and other church-sponsored programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/newsroom/page/0,15606,4032-1---14-168,00.html|publisher=newsroom.lds.org|title=Church Finances}}</ref> 

===Programs===
====Church Educational System====
{{main|Church Educational System}}

Latter-day Saints believe in the value of education.  Joseph Smith taught that "the glory of God is intelligence."<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|93|36}}</ref> Accordingly, the Church emphasizes education maintaining [[Brigham Young University]], [[Brigham Young University-Idaho]] (formerly Ricks College), and [[Brigham Young University-Hawaii]]. The Church also has [[religious education]] programs. ''[[Seminary]]'' is a program for high school students held daily in conjunction with the school year.  The ''Institutes of Religion'' program serves young adults between the ages of 18 and 30 and those enrolled in [[post-secondary education]] institutions with church owned buildings near college campuses designated for the purpose of religious education and cultural socialization.

In addition, the Church sponsors a low-interest educational loan program known as the [[Perpetual Education Fund]]. This fund is designed to benefit young men and women from all parts of the world who have served a mission, returned to their home, and need further education to become productive citizens in their respective countries. As they finish their education and enter the work force, they then are able to pay back the funds provided so that other individuals can attend both [[vocational]] [[technical schools]] and university.

==== Missionary program====   
{{main|Mormon missionary}}   
{{see also|Mission (LDS Church)}}
Young men between the ages of 19 and 26 who are considered worthy (follow the teachings of the Church) are encouraged to consider a two-year, full-time proselyting mission. Women (less encouraged but supported) who desire to serve a mission must be at least 21 and generally serve 18-month missions.  Elderly, retired couples are encouraged to serve missions as well, and their length of service varies from three to 36 months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lightplanet.com/mormons/daily/missionary/mormon_missionaries.html|title=Mormon Missionaries|publisher=Light Planet}}</ref> Unmarried adult women also occasionally serve a mission, of varying lengths.  

Today there are more than 330 missions and approximately 56,000 full time proselytizing missionaries serving throughout the world. In addition, about 5,100 missionaries are on special assignment missions, serving as health care specialists, doctors, craftsmen, artisans, construction supervisors, agricultural experts and educators for developing countries and educators, family history researchers and leadership trainers.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}
