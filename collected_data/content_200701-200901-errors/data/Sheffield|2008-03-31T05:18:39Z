'''Sheffield''' ({{Audio|en-uk-Sheffield.ogg|pronunciation}}) is a [[city status in the United Kingdom|city]] and [[metropolitan borough]] in [[South Yorkshire]], [[England]]. It is so named because of its origins in a field on the [[River Sheaf]] that runs through the city. 

The city has grown from its largely industrial roots to encompass a wide economic base. The population of the City of Sheffield is estimated at 525,800 people (2006),<ref>The mid-2006 population estimate for the City of Sheffield was 525,800 according to the [http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=9664&More=Y Office for National Statistics]. It should be noted that this figure includes the whole area included in the city. Some population figures, for example those given at [[List of English cities by population]] use just the urban core of the city and therefore are lower. The [http://www.sheffield.nhs.uk/healthdata/4-1.php Neighbourhood profiles] given by the Sheffield Health Authority estimates the figure at 547,631.</ref> and it is one of the eight largest [[England#Geography|English]] cities outside [[London]], which form the [[English Core Cities Group]]. The wider [[Sheffield Urban Area]], which extends beyond the city proper, has a population of 640,720.

Sheffield obtained world-wide recognition during the 19th century for its production of [[steel]]. Many innovations in the industry were developed locally, including [[crucible steel|crucible]] and [[stainless steel]]. This fuelled an almost tenfold increase in the population during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. It gained its [[Municipal charter|city charter]] in 1893 and became officially titled the City of Sheffield. International competition caused a decline in local industry during the 1970s and 1980s, and at the same time the nearby national coal industry collapsed, affecting Sheffield's population. 

==History==
{{main|History of Sheffield}}

The area that is now the City of Sheffield has been occupied since at least the last [[ice age]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Experts put date to UK rock art |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/4476303.stm |work=BBC News Online |publisher=BBC |date=2007-04-03 }}</ref> but the settlements that grew to form Sheffield date from the second half of the 1st millennium, and are of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Danelaw|Danish]] origin.<ref name="VICKERS">{{cite book |last=Vickers |first=J. Edward |title=Old Sheffield Town. An Historical Miscellany |year=1999 |edition=2nd |publisher=The Hallamshire Press Limited |location=Sheffield |isbn=1-874718-44-X }}</ref> In Anglo-Saxon times the Sheffield area straddled the border between the kingdoms of [[Mercia]] and [[Northumbria]]. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' reports that [[Eanred of Northumbria|King Eanred]] of [[Northumbria]] submitted to [[Egbert of Wessex|King Egbert]] of [[Wessex]] at the hamlet of [[Dore]] (now a suburb of Sheffield) in 829.<ref>In an entry dated 827 the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] states "Egbert led an army against the Northumbrians as far as Dore, where they met him, and offered terms of obedience and subjection, on the acceptance of which they returned home" ([http://omacl.org/Anglo/part2.html transcription]). Most sources (for example Vickers, ''Old Sheffield Town'') state that the date given in the chronicle is incorrect, and that 829 is the more likely date for this event.</ref> This event made Egbert the first Saxon to claim to be king of all of England. After the [[Norman conquest]], [[Sheffield Castle]] was built to control the local settlements, and a small town developed that is the nucleus of the modern city.

By 1296 a market had been established at what is now known as [[Castle Square, Sheffield|Castle Square]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sheffieldmarkets.co.uk/sheffield-market-history.php |title=History of Sheffield Castle and Markets |accessdate=2005-12-27 |publisher=Sheffield Markets }}</ref> and Sheffield subsequently grew into a small market town. In the 14th century Sheffield was already noted for the production of knives, as mentioned in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'',<ref>[[Geoffrey Chaucer]] in [[The Reeve's Prologue and Tale|The Reeve’s Tale]] from his book ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' wrote: "Ther was no man, for peril, dorste hym touche. A Sheffeld thwitel baar he in his hose. Round was his face, and camus was his nose"</ref> and by 1600 it had become the main centre of cutlery production in England, overseen by [[Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire|The Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire]]. From 1570 to 1584 [[Mary I of Scotland|Mary, Queen of Scots]] was held as a prisoner in Sheffield Castle and [[Sheffield Manor]].<ref name="VICKERS"/>
[[Image:ChaucerPortraitEllesmereMs.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Chaucer as a Canterbury pilgrim in the [[Ellesmere manuscript]] of ''The Canterbury Tales'']]

In the 1740s a form of the [[crucible steel]] process was discovered that allowed the manufacture of a better quality of [[steel]] than had previously been available. At about the same time a technique for fusing a thin sheet of [[silver]] onto a [[copper]] ingot to produce silver plating was invented and became widely known as [[Sheffield plate]]. These innovations spurred the growth of Sheffield as an industrial town. However, the loss of some important export markets led to a recession in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The resulting poor conditions culminated in a [[cholera]] epidemic that killed 402 people in 1832.<ref name="VICKERS"/> The [[Industrial Revolution]] saw a resurgence of Sheffield through the 19th century. As a result of its growing population, the town was incorporated as a [[borough]] in 1842 and granted a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city charter]] in 1893.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/your-city-council/lord-mayor/history-of-lord-mayor |title=History of the Lord Mayor |accessdate=2007-09-19 |publisher=Sheffield City Council }}</ref> The influx of people also led to demand for better water supplies, and a number of new reservoirs were constructed on the outskirts of the town. The collapse of the dam wall of one of these reservoirs in 1864 resulted in [[Great Sheffield Flood|the Great Sheffield Flood]], which killed 270 people and devastated large parts of the town. The growing population also led to the construction of a large number of back-to-back slums, which, along with severe pollution from the factories, inspired [[George Orwell]], writing in 1937, to declare, "Sheffield, I suppose, could justly claim to be called the ugliest town in the Old World".<ref>{{cite book |last=Orwell |first=George |authorlink=George Orwell |title=[[The Road to Wigan Pier]] |year=1937 |chapter=Chapter 7 |publisher=[[Victor Gollancz Ltd]] |location=London }}</ref>
[[Image:Beauchief abbey sheffield copy.jpg|175px|thumb|left|[[Beauchief Abbey]]]]
A recession in the 1930s was halted by only the increasing international tension as [[World War II]] loomed. The steel factories of Sheffield were set to work making weapons and ammunition for the war. As a result, once war was declared, the city became a target for bombing raids, the heaviest of which occurred over the nights of [[12 December]] and [[15 December]] [[1940]] (now known as the ''[[Sheffield Blitz]]''). More than 660 lives were lost and numerous buildings were destroyed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~engsheffield/blitz/blitz.htm |title=The Story of the Sheffield Blitz, 12th & 15th December 1940 |accessdate=2006-12-30 |work=Sheffield Genealogy Family & Social History }}</ref>

In the 1950s and 1960s, many of the slums were demolished and replaced with housing schemes such as the [[Park Hill, Sheffield|Park Hill flats]]. Large parts of the city centre were also cleared to make way for a new system of roads.<ref name="VICKERS"/> Increased automation and competition from abroad resulted in the closure of many steel mills. The 1980s saw the worst of this run-down of Sheffield's industries (along with those of many other areas in the UK). The 1984/5 [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|miners' strike]] affected the coal mining areas to the east and north east of Sheffield, though it is unlikely to have had a major impact upon Sheffield's economy. The building of the [[Meadowhall]] shopping centre on the site of a former steelworks in 1990 was a mixed blessing, creating much needed jobs but speeding the decline of the city centre. Attempts to regenerate the city were kick-started when the city hosted the 1991 [[Universiade|World Student Games, WSG]], which saw the construction of new sporting facilities such as the [[Sheffield Arena]], [[Don Valley Stadium]] and the [[Ponds Forge]] complex.<ref name="VICKERS"/> 

The city is now changing rapidly as new projects aim to regenerate some of the more run-down parts of the city. One such project, the ''Heart of the City Project'', has seen a number of public works in the city centre: the [[Sheffield Town Hall|Peace Gardens]] were renovated in 1998, the [[Millennium Galleries]] opened in April 2001, the [[Sheffield Winter Gardens|Winter Gardens]] were opened on [[22 May]] [[2003]], and a public space to link these two areas, the Millennium Square, was opened in May 2006. Further developments included the remodelling of [[Sheaf Square]] in front of the recently refurbished railway station. The new square contains ''The Cutting Edge'' a sculpture designed by Si Applied Ltd<ref>{{cite web |url=http://public-art.shu.ac.uk/sheffield/kni420.html |title=SI (Chris Knight, Keith Tyssen and Brett Payne) with Keiko Mukaide 'Cutting Edge', 2006 |accessdate=2007-03-15 |work= Public Art Research Archive, Sheffield Hallam University  }}</ref> made of Sheffield steel. 

==Governance==
The city currently returns six [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], but this will be reduced to five at the next election as one constituency, [[Sheffield Hillsborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Hillsborough]], will be abolished and merged with three other constituencies<ref>[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/women/story/0,,1967001,00.html Boundary changes threaten Labour women | Politics | guardian.co.uk<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.
[[Image:Sheffield Town Hall and The Peace Gardens.jpg|frame|right|[[Sheffield Town Hall]] and the Peace Gardens]]

Sheffield is governed by the elected [[Sheffield City Council]]. For most of the council's history it has been controlled by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and has historically been noted for its [[left-wing politics|leftist]] sympathies; during the 1980s administration under [[David Blunkett]], the area earned the sarcastic and rather derogatory appellation "[[People's Republic of South Yorkshire]]" from the British Right. However, the [[Liberal Democrats]] controlled the Council briefly at the turn of the 21st century. There are 84 councillors; the current council leader is [[Jan Wilson]]. The city also has a [[Lord Mayor]]. In the past the Office of Mayor had considerable authority, and carried with it executive powers over the finances and affairs of the city council. Today it is simply a ceremonial role. The current (2007/08) Lord Mayor is Arthur Dunworth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/your-city-council/lord-mayor |title=The Lord Mayor |accessdate=2007-09-19 |publisher=Sheffield City Council }}</ref> During the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2007|English Local Election 2007]] the Labour Party lost the council to [[No overall control|NOC]], with the [[Liberal Democrats]] gaining enough seats to make it a joint control council, one of 80 that year. The tacit support of the Green party ensured Labour remains in control.

The majority of council-owned facilities are now operated by independent charitable trusts. [[Sheffield International Venues]] runs many of the cities sporting and leisure facilities, including [[Sheffield Arena]] and [[Don Valley Stadium]]. [[Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust]] and the [[Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust]] take care of galleries and museums owned by the council. These include the [[Millennium Galleries]], [[Lyceum Theatre (Sheffield)|Lyceum Theatre]] and the [[Crucible Theatre]].

===International links===
Sheffield is formally twinned with [[Anshan]] in [[China]], [[Bochum]] in [[Germany]], [[Donetsk]] in [[Ukraine]], and [[Esteli]] in [[Nicaragua]]. There are more informal links with [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]] in [[Japan]], [[Kitwe]] in [[Zambia]], and [[Pittsburgh]] in the [[United States]].<ref>Sheffield City Council: [http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/facts-figures/international-links International Links] (Accessed [[19 September]] [[2007]])</ref> Sheffield has also had close links with [[Poland]], since Polish ex-servicemen who had fought alongside British forces during the [[Second World War]] settled in the city. As a result a Polish [[consulate]] was opened in the City in 1997 (now closed), the first new Polish consulate to open in the UK for over 60 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/uni/projects/pc/index.html |title=Polish Consulate in Sheffield |accessdate=2005-12-27 |publisher=The University of Sheffield }}</ref>

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Sheffield}}
Sheffield is located at {{coor dm|53|23|N|1|28|W|type:city_region:GB}}. It lies directly beside [[Rotherham]], from which it is separated by the [[M1 motorway]]. Although [[Barnsley (borough)|Barnsley Metropolitan Borough]] also borders Sheffield to the north, the town itself is a few miles further away. The southern and western borders of the city are shared with [[Derbyshire]]; in the first half of the 20th century Sheffield extended its borders south into Derbyshire, annexing a number of villages,<ref name="derbyshire_expansion">{{cite web |url=http://www.mdfs.net/Docs/Sheffield/Borders/ |title=The borders of Sheffield from 1843 to 1994 |accessdate=2005-12-26 |last=Harston |first=Jonathan G. |year=2005 }}</ref> including [[Totley]], [[Dore]] and the area now known as [[Mosborough]] Townships. Directly to the west of the city is the [[Peak District National Park]] and the [[Pennines|Pennine]] hill range.

Sheffield is a geographically diverse city.<ref name="GEO_diverse">{{cite web |url=http://www.map21ltd.com/COSTC11/sheffield-case.htm |title=Case Study - Sheffield, UK |accessdate=2005-09-26 |work=Greenstructures and Urban Planning |publisher=European Cooperation in the field of Scientific and Technical Research }}</ref> The city nestles in a natural amphitheatre created by several hills<ref name="number of hills">It is often stated that Sheffield is built on seven hills (for an example see Sheffield Hallam University's [http://www.shu.ac.uk/sheffield/ guide to the city for new students]). However, [http://www.mdfs.net/Docs/Sheffield/Hills/ a study by J.G.Harston] found there to be eight.</ref> and the confluence of five rivers: [[River Don, England|Don]], [[River Sheaf|Sheaf]], [[River Rivelin|Rivelin]], [[River Loxley|Loxley]] and [[Porter Brook|Porter]]. As such, much of the city is built on hillsides with views into the city centre or out to the countryside. The city's lowest point is just {{convert|33|ft|m|0}} above [[sea level]], while some parts of the city are at over {{convert|1640|ft|m|0}}. However, 89% of the housing in the city is between 330&nbsp; and &nbsp;660&nbsp;feet (100-200 m) above sea level.
[[Image:Sheffield wide from Meersbrook Park.jpg|thumb|750px|center|Panorama from Meersbrook Park.]]

With an estimated total of over two million trees,<ref name="GEO_treecount">{{cite web | publisher = Sheffield City Council | title = Trees & Woodlands in Sheffield | url = http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/out--about/parks-woodlands--countryside/trees--woodlands | accessdate = 2006-08-11 }}</ref> Sheffield has more trees per person than any other city in Europe. It has over 170 woodlands (covering {{convert|10.91|sqmi|sqkm|1|abbr=on|lk=on|disp=s}} ), 78 public parks (covering {{convert|7.07|sqmi|sqkm|1|abbr=on|disp=s}}) and 10 public gardens. Added to the  {{convert|52.0|sqmi|sqkm|1|}} of national park and {{convert|4.20|sqmi|sqkm|1|}} of water this means that 61% of the city is [[greenspace]].

Sheffield also has a very wide variety of [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]], comparing favourably with any city in the [[United Kingdom]]: urban, parkland and woodland, agricultural and arable land, moors, meadows and freshwater-based habitats. Large parts of the city are designated as [[SSSI|sites of special scientific interest]] including several urban areas.

The present city boundaries were set in 1974 (with slight modification in 1994), when the former [[county borough]] of Sheffield merged with [[Stocksbridge]] [[Urban District]] and two parishes from the [[Wortley Rural District]]. This area includes a significant part of the countryside surrounding the main urban region. Roughly a third of Sheffield lies in the [[Peak District National Park]] (no other English city includes parts of a [[national park]] within its boundary), and Sheffield often boasts of being Europe's greenest city, a claim that was reinforced when it won the 2005 [[Entente Florale]] competition. This was helped by the fact that Sheffield contains over 150 [[woodland]] spaces and 50 public [[park]]s.<ref name="SCCFACTS">{{cite web |url=http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/facts-figures |title=Facts & Figures |accessdate=2005-12-27 |publisher=Sheffield City Council }}</ref>

{{main|Districts of Sheffield}}

Sheffield is made up of numerous suburbs and neighbourhoods, many of which developed from villages or [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]] that were absorbed into Sheffield as the city grew.  These historical areas are largely ignored by the modern administrative and political divisions of the city; instead it is divided into 28 electoral [[ward (politics)|ward]]s, with each ward generally covering 4&ndash;6 areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/your-city-council/elections/ward-boundaries |title=Sheffield's Ward Boundaries |accessdate=2005-12-29 |publisher=Sheffield City Council }}</ref> The electoral wards are grouped into six [[United Kingdom constituencies|parliamentary constituencies]], although because of a different review cycle, the ward and constituency boundaries are currently not all conterminous. Sheffield is largely [[civil parish|unparished]], but [[Bradfield, South Yorkshire|Bradfield]] and [[Ecclesfield]] have parish councils, and [[Stocksbridge]] has a town council.

===Demography===
People from Sheffield are called [[Sheffielders]]. They are also colloquially known to people in the surrounding towns of Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Chesterfield as "dee-dars" (which derives from the traditional pronunciation of the "th" in the dialectal words "thee" and "thou", which is now extremely rare to hear).<ref name="deedar">{{cite book |last=Alexander |first=Don |title=Orreight Mi Ol': observations on dialect, humour and local lore of Sheffield & District |year=2001 |publisher=Northern Map Distributors |location=Sheffield |isbn=1-901587-18-5 }}  It had largely died out by the time of the [[Survey of English Dialects]] however.</ref> Many [[Yorkshire dialect and accent|Yorkshire dialect]] words and aspects of pronunciation derive from old Norse<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.viking.no/e/england/e-yorkshire_norse.htm |title=Yorkshire Dialect Words of Old Norse Origin |accessdate=2005-01-05 |work=The Vikings |publisher=The Viking Network }}</ref> due to the Viking influence in this region.

At the time of the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 UK census]], the ethnic composition of Sheffield's population was 91.2% White, 4.6% Asian, 1.8% Black, and 1.6% mixed. Sheffield also has large [[Poland|Polish]], [[Somalia|Somali]], [[Slovakia|Slovak]], [[Yemen]]i and [[Albanians|Albanian]] populations. In terms of religion, 68.6% of the population are [[Christian]] and 4.6% [[Muslim]]. Other religions represent less than 1% each. The number of people without a religion is above the national average at 17.9%, with 7.8% not stating their religion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/00cg.asp |title=Sheffield |accessdate=2005-12-21 |work=Census 2001 |publisher=Office for National Statistics  }}</ref> The largest quinary group is 20- to 24-year-olds (9.4%), mainly because of the large university population (45,000+).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=9585&Pos=&ColRank=1&Rank=128 |title=Mid-2005 Population Estimates; Quinary age groups and sex for Primary Care Organisations (PCOs) for England; estimated resident population (experimental).

After many years of decline, the Sheffield economy is going through a strong revival. The 2004 [[Barclays Bank]] Financial Planning study<ref>{{cite news |title=Wealth hotspots 'outside London' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3871857.stm |work=BBC News Online |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=[[7 July]] [[2004]] }}</ref> revealed that, in 2003, the Sheffield district of [[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Hallam]] was the highest ranking area outside London for overall wealth, the proportion of people earning over £60,000 a year standing at almost 12%. A survey by Knight Frank<ref>{{cite news |title=Sheffield 'hotbed' for investment |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/4314628.stm |work=BBC News Online |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=[[6 October]] [[2005]] }}</ref> revealed that Sheffield was the fastest-growing city outside of [[London]] for office and residential space and rents during the second half of 2004. Some £250 million was also invested in the city during 2005. The Sheffield economy is worth £7.4 billion (2003 GVA).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_economy/NUTS3_Tables_1-12.xls |title=Headline GVA by NUT3 area at current basic prices 1995 to 2003 |accessdate=2005-12-22 |format=XLS |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] }}</ref>  This can be seen by the current surge of redevelopments, including the [[St. Pauls Tower|City Lofts Tower]] and accompanying [[St. Pauls Place]], Velocity Living, and [[the Moor]] redevelopment,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moorsheffield.com/public_consultation/MoorSheffield_boards.pdf |title=MoorSheffield Consultation Panels |accessdate=2007-04-06 |format=PDF |work=MoorSheffield |publisher=RREEF }}</ref> the forthcoming [[New Retail Quarter|NRQ]] and the recently completed [[Sheffield Winter Gardens|Winter Gardens]], [[Peace Gardens]], [[Millennium Galleries]], many project under the [[Sheffield One]] redevelopment agency.

Sheffield has an international reputation for metallurgy and [[steel]]-making.<ref>There are numerous sources showing the international reputation of Sheffield for metallurgy, and in particular steel and cutlery manufacture. Some examples are: the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], which begins its entry for ''Sheffield'', "The name of a manufacturing city of Yorkshire, famous for cutlery"; and the [[Encyclopaedia Britannica]], which in its entry for ''Sheffield'' states that by 1830 Sheffield had earned "recognition as the world centre of high-grade steel manufacture". David Hey in the preface to his 1997 book ''Mesters to Masters: A History of the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire.'' ([[Oxford University Press]], ISBN 0-19-828997-9) states "It (Sheffield) was known for its cutlery wares long before the incorporation of the Cutlers' Company in 1624, and long before it acquired an international reputation as the steel capital of the world."</ref> Many innovations in these fields have been made in Sheffield. [[Benjamin Huntsman]] discovered the [[crucible technique]] in the 1740s at his workshop in [[Handsworth, South Yorkshire|Handsworth]]. This process was made obsolete in 1856 by [[Henry Bessemer]]'s invention of the [[Bessemer converter]]. [[Thomas Boulsover]] invented [[Sheffield Plate]] (silver-plated copper) in the early 18th century. [[Stainless steel]] was invented by [[Harry Brearley]] in 1912, and the work of [[Frederick Brian Pickering|F. B. Pickering]] and T. Gladman throughout the 1960s, '70s, and '80s was fundamental to the development of modern high-strength low-alloy steels. Further innovations continue, with new advanced manufacturing technologies and techniques being developed on the [[Advanced Manufacturing Park]] by Sheffield's universities and other independent research organisations. 
Organisations currently located on the AMP include; the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC, a research partnership between The Boeing Company and The University of Sheffield), Castings Technology International (Cti) and TWI.

While iron and steel have long been the main industries of Sheffield, [[coal mining]] has also been a major industry, particularly in the outlying areas, and the [[Palace of Westminster]] in [[London]] was built using [[limestone]] from [[quarry|quarries]] in the nearby village of [[Anston]]. Other areas of employment include [[call centre]]s, the [[City Council]], universities and [[hospital]]s. Sheffield currently produces more steel per year than at any other time in its history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gnn.gov.uk/regions/default.asp?NewsAreaID=2&ReleaseID=-3&LocaleID=6 |title=About Yorkshire and Humber |accessdate=2005-10-23 |publisher=Government News Network }}</ref> However, the industry is now less noticeable as it has become highly automated and employs far fewer staff than in the past.
[[Image:High Street, Sheffield.jpg|thumb|left|High Street, Central Sheffield]]
Sheffield is also a major [[retail]] centre, and home to many [[High Street]] and [[department store]]s as well as designer boutiques. The main city centre shopping areas are on [[The Moor]] precinct, [[Fargate]], [[Orchard Square]] and the [[Devonshire Quarter]]. [[Department store]]s in Sheffield City centre include [[John Lewis Partnership|John Lewis]], [[Marks and Spencer]], [[Atkinsons]], Castle House [[Co-op (supermarket)|Co-op]], [[Debenhams]] and [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworths]] . Sheffield's main [[market]] is the [[Castle Market]], built above the remains of the castle. Shopping areas outside the city centre include the [[Meadowhall]] [[shopping centre]] and retail park, [[Ecclesall Road]], [[London Road (Sheffield)|London Road]], [[Hillsborough, South Yorkshire|Hillsborough]] and the [[Crystal Peaks]] [[shopping centre]]. 

Sheffield has a District Energy system which exploits the city's domestic waste, converting it to electricity. It also provides hot water, which is distributed through over {{convert|25|mi|km|-1}} of pipes under the city, via two networks. These networks supply heat and hot water for many buildings throughout the city. These include not only cinemas, hospitals, shops, and offices but also universities ([[Sheffield Hallam University]] and the [[University of Sheffield]]), residential properties<ref>[http://www.energy.rochester.edu/uk/sheffield/ Sheffield Heat and Power<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. Energy generated in a waste plant produces 36MW of thermal energy and up to 6.8MW electrical energy from 115,000 tonnes of waste. It is claimed <ref>[http://www.greenenergy.co.uk/ab_facts.asp District Energy - Veolia Environmental Services<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> that for every 100,000MWh of energy supplied by district energy 31,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide is displaced and that for every 100,000MWh of useful energy delivered 154,000MWh of fossil fuel energy is displaced.

In a 2005 survey on spending potential, [[Meadowhall]] came 16th (third in out-of-town shopping centres behind [[Bluewater]](7th) and [[The Trafford Centre]](15th)) with £977 million while Sheffield city centre came 18th with £953 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caci.co.uk/msd.asp?url=lsp-retailfootprint.htm |title=Retail Footprint 2005 |accessdate=2005-10-05 |publisher=[[CACI|CACI Ltd]] }}</ref> In a 2004 survey on the top retail destinations, Meadowhall was 20th while Sheffield was 35th.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://press.experian.com/popup/sd.cfm?f=National%20release%202004.htm |title=Results of the Experian 2004 Retail Ranking |accessdate=2005-10-05 |publisher=Expirian }}</ref>

==Transport==
{{Main|Transport in Sheffield}}
There are two main interchanges for all public transport modes ([[Inter-city rail|national]] and [[Commuter rail|local rail]], [[Sheffield Supertram|tram]], [[Bus|local buses]] and [[Coach (vehicle)|coaches]]) at [[Meadowhall]] and in the [[Sheffield City Centre|city centre]].

===National and international travel===
Sheffield is linked into the national motorway network via the [[M1 motorway|M1]] and [[M18 motorway|M18]] motorways. The M1 skirts the north-east of the city, linking Sheffield with [[London]] to the south and [[Leeds]] to the north and crosses [[Tinsley Viaduct]] near Rotherham; the M18 branches from the M1 close to Sheffield, linking the city with [[Doncaster]], [[Robin Hood Doncaster Sheffield Airport]] and the [[Humber]] ports. The [[Sheffield Parkway]] connects the city centre with the motorways. The [[A57 road|A57]] and [[A61 road]]s are the major trunk roads through Sheffield, linking Sheffield with Manchester, Worksop, Barnsley, and Chesterfield.  Sheffield is an important hub in the national network of long-distance buses (coaches), and there are direct services from distant cities such as Plymouth and Edinburgh.

[[Image:Sheffield Station from Sheaf Square.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Sheffield Midland station]].]]
The [[Midland Main Line]] [[Rail transport in Great Britain|railway]] south from Sheffield links the city to the East Midlands and London: providing direct services to Nottingham, Derby, Leicester, Bedford (the fastest train Sheffield to London is two hours).  Also running through Sheffield is the main NE/SW cross-country line which links the East of Scotland and Northeast of England directly with West and South Yorkshire, the West Midlands, and the Southwest: providing direct services to Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Newcastle, Darlington, York, Leeds, Birmingham, Bristol, Taunton, and Exeter.  Sheffield also lies on the line linking Liverpool and Manchester with Hull and East Anglia: providing direct services to Liverpool, Manchester,  Hull, Lincoln, Ely and Norwich. Sheffield also has good links with its neighbouring towns and cities, [[Barnsley]], [[Doncaster]] and [[Rotherham]]. The main station for all these services is [[Sheffield Midland station]] on the south-eastern edge of the [[Sheffield City Centre|city centre]]. The station at [[Meadowhall Interchange|Meadowhall]] serves all trains travelling northeast except the fastest. Passenger rail services through Sheffield are provided by [[East Midlands Trains]], [[Cross Country]], [[TransPennine Express]], and [[Northern Rail]].<ref>[http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/system/galleries/download/print_maps/Nat_Rail_Passenger_Operators_2005.pdf UK rail network map] (PDF) showing which train companies operate on each route. Provided by [http://www.nationalrail.co.uk National Rail Enquiries] (Accessed [[28 December]] [[2005]])</ref>

The closest international airport to Sheffield is [[Doncaster Sheffield Airport]], which is located {{convert|18|mi|km}} from the city centre. The airport opened on [[April 28]] [[2005]] and is served mainly by [[Low-cost carrier|budget airlines]]. It currently handles around one million passengers a year. [[Sheffield City Airport]] opened in 1997 but, due in part to its short runway and lack of radar, has been unable to capitalise on the boom in low cost air travel. [[Manchester Airport]], [[Leeds Bradford International Airport]] and [[Nottingham East Midlands Airport|East Midlands Airport: Nottingham, Leicester, Derby]] all lie within a one hour's drive of the city. Manchester Airport is connected to Sheffield by [[South TransPennine|a direct train]] every hour.

===Local travel===
The [[A57 road|A57]] and [[A61 road]]s are the major trunk roads through Sheffield. These run east-west and north-south, respectively, crossing in the city centre. Other major roads generally radiate spoke-like from the city centre. An inner [[Sheffield Inner Ring Road|ring road]], mostly constructed in the 1970s and recently (2007) extended to form a complete ring,<ref>[http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/?pgid=87823&fs=b] [[Sheffield City Council]], [[19 September]] [[2007]]</ref> allows traffic to avoid the city centre, and an [[Sheffield Outer Ring Road|outer ring road]] runs to the east, south-east and north, nearer the edge of the city, but does not serve the western side of Sheffield.

The hilly topography of Sheffield and its former nature as a centre of industry rather than commerce meant that the city did not develop as extensive a suburban and inter-urban railway network as other comparable British cities. However, there are several busy local rail routes running along the city's valleys and beyond, connecting it with other parts of [[South Yorkshire]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[Nottinghamshire]], Lincolnshire and [[Derbyshire]]. These local routes include the [[Penistone Line]], the [[Dearne Valley Line]], the [[Hope Valley Line]], and the [[Hallam Line]]. As well as the main stations of [[Sheffield Midland station|Sheffield]] and [[Meadowhall Interchange|Meadowhall]], there are four suburban stations at [[Chapeltown railway station|Chapeltown]], [[Darnall railway station|Darnall]], [[Woodhouse railway station|Woodhouse]] and [[Dore railway station|Dore]].
[[Image:Supertram Castle Square.jpg|thumb|[[Sheffield Supertram]] at Castle Square]]
The light rail system ''[[Sheffield Supertram]]'' (Operated by [[Stagecoach Sheffield]]), opened in 1994, serves the city. Its network consists of three lines, from Halfway to Malin Bridge, from Meadowhall to Middlewood, and from Meadowhall to Herdings Park, with all three lines running via the city centre.<ref>[http://www.supertram.net/about.html Stagecoach Supertram:About Us] (Accessed [[28 December]] [[2005]])</ref>

A sizeable [[bus]] infrastructure operates from a main hub at [[Pond Street bus station]]. Other bus stations lie at [[Halfway, Sheffield|Halfway]], [[Hillsborough, South Yorkshire|Hillsborough]] and [[Meadowhall]]. A flurry of new operators were created after deregulation in 1986,<ref>[http://worldbank.org/transport/expopres/bayliss1.doc Bus Privatisation in the United Kingdom] [[World Bank]]</ref> though a series of mergers have reduced the number. [[First South Yorkshire]], part of [[FirstGroup plc|FirstGroup]], became by far the largest bus operator and in recent years implemented a series of fare rises and service cuts which saw bus ridership drop.<ref>[http://www.sheffieldtoday.net/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=58&ArticleID=1115892 Call for action to halt fall in bus passengers.] [[Sheffield Star]], [[16 August]] [[2005]]</ref><ref>[http://www.sheffieldtoday.net/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=58&ArticleID=1332988 Next stop in bus protest campaign.] [[Sheffield Star]], [[31 January]] [[2006]]</ref>.  Recent developments have seen [[Stagecoach Sheffield]] taking over Yorkshire Terrier and expanding their bus services in the city.  This has resulted in increased competition, and price drops on certain routes.

Sheffield also offers a free bus service - the FreeBee. This service is operated by TM Travel, and runs every seven minutes between the station and the city centre. 

Although hilly, Sheffield is compact and has few major trunk roads running through it. It is on the [[Trans-Pennine Trail]], a [[National Cycle Network]] route running from [[Southport]] in the north-west to [[Hornsea]] in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire|East Riding]], and has a developing Strategic Cycle Network within the city. The [[Peak District National Park]], an area of outstanding natural beauty popular with both on- and off-road cyclists, is so close to Sheffield that part of the park lies within the city boundary, and there are green routes into the park almost from the city centre.

==Sport==
{{main|Sport in Sheffield}}
Sheffield has a long sporting heritage. In 1857 a collective of [[cricket]]ers formed the world's first-ever official [[Football (soccer)|football]] club, [[Sheffield F.C.]], and by 1860 there were 15 football clubs in Sheffield. There are now two local clubs in the [[English Football League teams|Football League]] and play in the [[Football League Championship]]: [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], both of which formed from cricket clubs, and two major non-league sides: Sheffield F.C. and [[Hallam F.C.]], which also formed from cricket clubs. These are the two oldest club sides in the world and, in addition, Hallam F.C. still play at [[Sandygate Road|the world's oldest football ground]] near the suburb of Crosspool. Sheffield and Hallam contest what has become known as the [[Sheffield derby]], whilst United and Wednesday contest the [[Steel City derby]].

In April 1989, tragedy struck when 96 [[Liverpool FC]] fans [[Hillsborough disaster|died in a crush]] during their FA Cup semi final at Sheffield Wednesday's [[Hillsborough Stadium]].

[[Image:DonValleyStadium.jpg|thumb|300px|Don Valley Stadium during the World Student Games in 1991]]

Sheffield also has close ties with [[snooker]], due to the fact that the city's [[Crucible Theatre]] is the venue for the [[World Snooker Championships]]. The English [[Squash (sport)|squash]] open is also held there every year. The International Open [[Bowls]] tournament is held in Sheffield at [[Ponds Forge]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/bowls/6112106.stm Report on International Open bowls 2006]</ref>

The city also boasts the [[Sheffield Eagles]] [[rugby league]], [[Sheffield Tigers RUFC|Sheffield Tigers]] [[Rugby Union]], [[Sheffield Sharks]] [[basketball]], [[Sheffield Steelers]] [[ice hockey]] and [[Sheffield Tigers (Speedway)|Sheffield Tigers]] [[Motorcycle speedway|Speedway]] teams. Sheffield is home to 2004 and 2007 World [[Superbike]] champion [[James Toseland]] and of climber [[Joe Simpson (mountaineer)|Joe Simpson]]. Former athlete and world record holder, [[Sebastian Coe, Baron Coe|Sebastian Coe]] grew up in the city and began his career as a member of the Hallamshire Harriers.  [[England|England Cricket]] captain [[Michael Vaughan]] also grew up in Sheffield.

Many of Sheffield's extensive sporting facilities were built for the [[Universiade|World Student Games]], which the city hosted in 1991. They include the [[Don Valley Stadium|Don Valley International Athletics Stadium]] which is the largest athletics stadium in the [[UK]] with a capacity of 25,000,<ref>[http://www.donvalleystadium.co.uk/content.php?nPageID=1 Main page of Don Valley Stadium]</ref> [[Sheffield Arena]], and [[Ponds Forge]] international diving and swimming complex, where [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] medallist [[Leon Taylor]] trains. There are also facilities for golf, climbing and bowling, as well as a newly inaugurated (2003) national ice-skating arena ([[IceSheffield]]). The [[Sheffield Ski Village]] is the largest artificial [[ski]] resort in Europe, and is due to undergo a major expansion soon.<ref name="SCCFACTS"/> The city also has three indoor [[climbing]] centres. Sheffield was the UK's first National City of Sport and is now home to the [[English Institute of Sport]] (EIS). 

Sheffield is home to [[Steve Peat]] who is a World Cup champion in [[Mountain Bike World Championships]] in 2002, 2004, 2006.

==Culture and attractions==
{{main|Culture of Sheffield}}
[[Image:PondsForge.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Ponds Forge]] from Park Square]]
7.2% of Sheffield's working population are employed in the creative industries, well above the national average of 4%.<ref name="SCCFACTS"/>  [[Open Up Sheffield]] is an annual event over the first two weekends in May where local [[visual art]]ists and fine [[craft]] workers invite the public to their studios and other venues.

===Music===
{{See also|List of musicians from Sheffield}}

Sheffield has been the home of several well-known bands and musicians, with an unusually large number of [[synth pop]] and other [[electronic music|electronic]] outfits hailing from there. These include [[The Human League]], [[Heaven 17]], [[ABC (band)|ABC]], the [[Thompson Twins]], [[Wavestar]], and the more [[Industrial music|industrially]] inclined [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]] and [[Clock DVA]]. This electronic tradition has continued: [[techno music|techno]] label [[Warp Records]] was a central pillar of the [[Yorkshire Bleeps and Bass]] scene of the early 1990s, and has gone on to become one of Britain's oldest and best-loved dance music labels.  There was a thriving [[goa trance]] scene in the early 1990s. [[Moloko]] and [[Autechre]], one of the leading lights of so-called [[intelligent dance music]], are also based in Sheffield. Current electronic music labels in the city include Dust Science Recordings and Audiobulb, a more recent addition is R8 Records, a dubstep and nichestep label based in the flats of Sharrow and the suburbs of The Groves. The city has a number of nightclubs - [[Gatecrasher|Gatecrasher One]] was one of the most popular [[nightclub]]s in the north of England until its destruction in a fire on 18 June 2007. 

Current club nights include [[techno]] and [[breakbeat]] events such as Urban Gorilla, [[drum and bass]] events, The Tuesday Club & Bass Bar, Dubcentral ([[Dub music|dub]] and [[reggae]]), Threads. at DQ, Razor Stiletto, Headcharge (hard techno), Off The Rails, C90 ([[dubstep]], techno and [[electronica]]), Uprising (Hardcore and Hard Trance) based at Plug, [[electro]] night Club Pony and Future Funk. There are many smaller nights such as Lights Down Low, Dirty Cheese, Rough Disko, Death By Shoes and Dark Crystal, the cities dedicated dubstep night. Sheffield is also the spiritual home of [[Gatecrasher]].

Sheffield has also seen the birth of [[Little Man Tate (Band)|Little Man Tate]], [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]], [[Def Leppard]], [[Joe Cocker]], [[Richard Hawley]], [[The Longpigs]], [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Milburn (band)|Milburn]], [[The Long Blondes]], [[Reverend and the Makers]], [[65daysofstatic]], [[Bring Me The Horizon]], [[Derek Bailey]] and [[Tony Oxley]]. The highly influential [[post-punk]] group the [[Comsat Angels]] hail from Sheffield. 1998 [[Mercury Music Prize]] award winners [[Gomez (band)|Gomez]] are also connected to Sheffield, as some of the founding members went to [[Sheffield University]]. Along with many other popular and alternative musicians, the city is the base for a well developed and thriving unsigned music scene.

The [[Arctic Monkeys]] are particularly notable for their heavy use of a Sheffield accent in their songs. Hailing from the [[High Green]] suburb, their lyrics are often written in a Yorkshire dialect and contain references to local places such as [[Rotherham]], [[Hunter's Bar]], [[Hillsborough, South Yorkshire|Hillsborough]] and [[Shiregreen and Brightside|Shiregreen]]. They were one of several [[Indie (music)|indie]] bands to emerge from the city as part of the [[New Yorkshire]] movement.

[[Image:National Centre for Popular Music.jpg|thumb|left|Former National Centre for Popular Music]]
The city's ties with music were acknowledged in 1999, when the [[National Centre for Popular Music]], a museum dedicated to the subject of [[popular music]], was opened. It was not as successful as was hoped, however, and later evolved to become a live music venue; then in February 2005, the unusual steel-covered building became the [[students' union]] for [[Sheffield Hallam University]]. Live music venues in the city include the [[Leadmill]], [[Corporation (nightclub)|Corporation]], the [[Boardwalk (nightclub)|Boardwalk]], the Plug, the [[Sheffield City Hall|City Hall]], the [[University of Sheffield]], the Studio Theatre at the [[Crucible Theatre]], and [[The Grapes (Sheffield)|The Grapes]]. A new venue, [[Carling Academy Sheffield]] will open in April 2008.

Sheffield has a number of local orchestras including the Hallam Sinfonia, [[Sheffield Symphony Orchestra]], the Sheffield Chamber Orchestra, the [[Sheffield Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the [[City of Sheffield Youth Orchestra]]. The city is also home to a strong [[brass band]] tradition, with bands associated with factories and villages.

[[Image:Lyceum theatre sheffield.jpg|thumb|right|The Lyceum & Crucible Theatres]]

Sheffield has two major theatres, the [[Lyceum Theatre (Sheffield)|Lyceum Theatre]] and the [[Crucible Theatre]], which together with the smaller [[Studio Theatre]] make up the largest theatre complex outside [[London]].<ref>[http://www.sheffieldtheatres.co.uk/ Sheffield Theatres] (accessed [[26 December]] [[2005]])</ref> There are four major [[art gallery|art galleries]], including the modern [[Millennium Galleries]] and the [[Site Gallery]], which specialises in multimedia. The [[Sheffield Walk of Fame]] in the [[Sheffield City Centre|City Centre]] honours famous Sheffielders like the [[Hollywood]] version.

The [[Sheffield Arena]] is located in the Don Valley area just outside the city centre and it is one of the major arenas in the UK hosting big music acts of the world.

[[Valley Centertainment]] is an entertainment park on the outskirts of the city centre and features Cineworld Cinemas, Hollywood Bowl and lots of restaurants and bars. It is located next to the [[Sheffield Arena]] and [[Meadowhall|Meadowhall shopping centre]].

There are about [[Listed buildings in Sheffield|1,000 listed buildings in Sheffield]] (including the whole of the Sheffield postal district). Of these, only five are Grade I listed. 42 are Grade II*, the rest being Grade II listed. Compared with other English cities Sheffield has few Grade I buildings. [[Liverpool]], for example, has [[Listed buildings in Liverpool|26 Grade I]] [[listed buildings]]. This situation led the noted architecture historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], writing in 1959, to comment that the city was "architecturally a miserable disappointment" with no pre-19th century buildings of any distinction.<ref>Harman, R. & Minnis, J. (2004) ''Pevsner City Guides: Sheffield'' p3. New Haven & London: Yale University Press. ISBN 0-300-10585-1</ref>

The city has many large parks such as [[Millhouses Park]], [[Endcliffe Park]] and [[Graves Park]].

Large parts of the city are designated as [[SSSI|sites of special scientific interest]] (areas of land which the British Government considers to be of special interest by virtue of its fauna, flora, geological or physiographical features) including several urban areas.

The films ''[[The Full Monty]]'', ''[[Threads]]'', ''[[When Saturday Comes (film)|When Saturday Comes]]'' and ''[[Whatever Happened to Harold Smith?]]'' were based in the city. ''[[F.I.S.T.]]'' also included several scenes filmed in Sheffield. Besides the story of ''[[The History Boys]]'' is set in Sheffield at Cutler's Grammar School. Sheffield's daily [[newspaper]] is the ''[[Sheffield Star]]'', complemented by the weekly ''[[Sheffield Telegraph]]''. Sheffield also has many free publications such as Sandman, Go Sheffield, Exposed, Clunge and Radio Coma. The [[BBC]]'s [[BBC Radio Sheffield|Radio Sheffield]] and the independent [[Hallam FM]] and sister station [[Magic AM]] broadcast to the city. The [[Sheffield International Documentary Festival]], the UK's leading documentary festival, has been run annually since 1994 at the [[Showroom Cinema]]. The annual Lovebytes digital arts festival takes place in Sheffield across a variety of venues. A song by [[The Clash]] (who played their first ever gig in Sheffield at the Black Swan - now known as The [[Boardwalk]]), titled "[[This Is England (song)| This Is England ]]" features the lyric: "This is England / This knife of Sheffield steel / This is England / This is how we feel." Sheffield hosted the [[Awards of the International Indian Film Academy]] in 2007 which was a big success and raised awareness of global warming by having an unconventional green carpet. Internationally recognised design agency [[The Designers Republic]] is based in Sheffield, as well as Universal Everything, Tado and Dust.

{{main|Education in Sheffield}}
Sheffield has two [[universities]], the [[University of Sheffield]] and [[Sheffield Hallam University]]. The two combined bring 55,000 students to the city every year, including many from the [[Far East]]. As a result of its large student population, Sheffield has many bars, cafes, clubs and shops as well as student housing to accommodate them.

Sheffield has two [[further education]] [[colleges]]. [[Sheffield College]] is organised on a collegiate basis and was originally created from the merger of six colleges around the city, since reduced to just four: Castle in the city centre, Hillsborough, Crystal Peaks on the outskirts and [[Norton, Sheffield, South Yorkshire|Norton]], each operating as semi-autonomous constituents of Sheffield College. [[Longley Park Sixth Form College]], managed by the [[Local Education Authority]] opened in 2004.

There are also 141 [[Primary education|primary schools]] and 27 [[Secondary education|secondary schools]] - of which seven have [[sixth form]]s e.g. [[Tapton School]] - and seven private schools, most notably [[Birkdale School]] and the [[Sheffield High School (South Yorkshire)|Sheffield High School]] for Girls.
