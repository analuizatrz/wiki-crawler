== History ==
In 1863 Robert College was founded in Bebek as the oldest American highschool outside the borders of United States. The school was founded by Cristopher Robert (a wealthy American) and Cyrus Hamlin. 6 years after its foundation, with a permission from Ottoman Empire, a campus was built in Bebek at the ridge of Rumelia Fortress for Robert College. The building which was built first was named "Hamlin Hall" in memory of Hamlin. After Hamlin's death, Robert College was successfully administrated by George Washburn (1877-1903) and Caleb Gates (1903-1932).


== Academics ==
The language of instruction at RC is English (science, math, literature, art) and Turkish (Turkish literature, history, philosophy, geography). The school offers many AP level courses such as Advanced Biology, Advanced Physics, Advanced Chemistry, AP English, Calculus (both AB and BC), AP Computer and Statistics. It also provides extensive opportunities to students interested in musics and the arts. Several musical nights take place during the academic year and Marble Hall (the hall of the main building Gould) features year-round artistic exhibitions. The most popular arts courses include Studio Art and Photography (Intro & Advanced).

Students are given flexibility in their selections of courses although there are some restrictions. At least one Literature (other than Turkish Lit.) course per semester is mandatory and every student must take at least one arts course to graduate. Recent changes have made at least two whole-year Foreign Language ([[French language|French]] or [[German language|German]]) courses obligatory. Students have one elective course in their freshman and sophomore years and four elective courses in their junior and senior years.
