[[Image:Asimohonda.jpg|thumb|250px|[[ASIMO]], a [[humanoid]] robot manufactured by [[Honda]].]]
A '''robot''' is an electro-mechanical or bio-mechanical device or group of devices that can perform autonomous or preprogrammed tasks. A [[Teleoperation|telerobot]] may act under the direct control of a [[human]], such as the [[Canadarm|robotic arm]] on a [[space shuttle]], or autonomously under the [[control theory|control]] of a programmed [[computer]].  Robots may be used to perform tasks that are too dangerous or difficult for humans, such as [[radioactive waste]] clean-up, or may be used to automate mindless repetitive tasks that should be performed with more precision by a robot than by a human, such as [[automobile]] production.

==Definition==
The word "robot" is used to refer to a wide range of machines, the common feature of which is that they are all capable of movement and can be used to perform physical tasks. [[International standard]] [[ISO 8373]] defines a "robot" as:

{{cquote|An automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose, manipulator programmable in three or more axes, which may be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications.<ref>[http://www.dira.dk/pdf/robotdef.pdf Definition of a robot]</ref>}}

Robots take on many different forms, ranging from humanoid, which mimic the human form and way of moving, to industrial, whose appearance is dictated by the function they are to perform. Robots can be grouped generally as [[mobile robot]]s (eg. autonomous vehicles), [[manipulator|manipulator robots]] (eg. industrial robots) and [[self reconfigurable]] robots, which can conform themselves to the task at hand. Robots may be controlled directly by a human, such as remotely-controlled bomb-disposal robots and robotic arms; or may act according to their own decision making ability, provided by [[artificial intelligence]].  However, the majority of robots fall in-between these extremes, being controlled by pre-programmed computers.  Such robots may include [[feedback loops]] such that they can interact with their environment, but do not display actual intelligence. "Robot" is also used in a general sense to mean any machine that mimics the actions of a human ([[biomimicry]]), in the physical sense or in the mental sense.

The word comes from the [[Czech language|Czech]] word  ''robota'', compulsory [[labour]]<ref>[http://capek.misto.cz/english/robot.html Who did actually invent the word "robot" and what does it mean?]</ref> or [[work]] (also used in a sense of a [[serf]]), first used by [[Karel Čapek]] in his science fiction play [[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]] in 1921, and according to Čapek, was coined by his brother, painter [[Josef Čapek]] (see also [[Karel Capek#Etymology of robot|etymology of robot]]). The word was brought into popular Western use by famous science fiction writer [[Isaac Asimov]].

==Contemporary uses ==

{{Main|Industrial robot|Domestic robot}}

[[Image:Picture 232.jpg|thumb|350px|right|A boy watches an robotic assembly line at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry.]]
[[Image:Industrial_Robotics_in_car_production.jpg|thumb|300px|Industrial robots doing vehicle underbody assembly ([[KUKA]])[http://www.kukarobotics.com].]]
Robots are growing in complexity and their use in industry is becoming more widespread. The main use of robots has so far been in the automation of mass production industries, where the same, definable tasks must be performed repeatedly in exactly the same fashion. [[Automaker|Car production]] is the primary example of the employment of large and complex robots for producing goods. Robots are used in that process for the [[painting]], [[welding]] and assembly of the cars. Robots are good for such tasks because the tasks can be accurately defined and must be performed the same every time, with little need for feedback to control the exact process being performed. Industrial robots can be manufactured in a wide range of sizes and so can handle more tasks requiring heavy lifting than a human could. 

They are also useful in environments which are unpleasant or dangerous for humans to work in, for example [[bomb disposal]], work in [[space]] (eg. [[Canadarm2]]) or [[underwater]], in [[mining]], and for the [[cleaning]] of [[toxic]] [[waste]]. Robots are also used for patrolling these toxic areas,
robots equipped for this job are e.g. the [[Robowatch OFRO]], and [[Robowatch MOSRO]].

Often this is referred to as the "Three D's: Dull, Dirty and Dangerous" work. Hundreds of [[bomb disposal]] robots such as the [[iRobot]] [[Packbot]] and the [[Foster-Miller TALON]] are being used in Iraq and Afghanistan by the U.S. military to defuse roadside bombs, or improvised explosive devices ([[IED]]s) in an activity known as Explosive Ordinance Disposal ([[EOD]]).

Automated Guided Vehicles ([[Automated Guided Vehicle|AGV]]s) are movable robots that are used in large facilities such as warehouses hospitals  and container ports, for the movement of goods, or even for safety and security patrols. Such vehicles follow wires, markers or laser-guidance to navigate around the location and can be programmed to move between places to deliver goods or patrol a certain area.  Top manufacturers include Egemin, [[Transbotics]], FMC and Jervis B Webb  makes AGV "brains" used in freely moving autonomous vehicles that do not require fixed paths as earlier AGVs have done.

One robot being used in the United States is the [[Tug robot]] by [[Aethon]] Inc, an automated delivery system for hospitals. This robot travels around hospitals to deliver medical supplies, medication, food trays, or just about anything to nursing stations. Once it is finished it goes back to its charging station and waits for its next task.

[[Domestic robot]]s are now available that perform simple tasks such as vacuum cleaning and grass cutting. By the end of 2004 over 1,000,000 [[vacuum cleaner]] units had been sold [http://www.unece.org/press/pr2004/04robots_index.htm]. Examples of these domestic robots are the [[Scooba]] and [[Roomba]] robots from iRobot Corporation, Friendly Robotics' Robomower, and Electrolux's Automower. 

Other domestic robots have the aim of providing companionship ([[social robot]]s) or play partners ([[ludobot]]s) to people. Examples are Sony's [[Aibo]], a commercially successful robot pet dog, [[Paro (robot)|Paro]], a robot baby seal intended to soothe nursing home patients, and [[Wakamaru]], a humanoid robot intended for elderly and disabled people. Other humanoid robots are in development with the aim of being able to provide robotic functions in a form that may be more aesthetically pleasing to customers, thereby increasing the likelihood of them being accepted in society.

Robots perform in arts festivals and at museums with works such as James Seawright's House Plants, 1983, in which an artificial flower opens in response to viewer interaction or Ken Rinaldo's Autotelematic Spider Bots, 2006 [http://kenrinaldo.com] where robots that appear like spiders, see like bats and act like ants interact with the public and structure each others behaviors through bluetooth communication. One of the earliest electronic art robots is Jim Pallas' 1976 Blue Wazoo[http://www.ylem.org/artists/jpallas/MORWAZOO/BLUWAZOO.HTM] which, using TTL IC devices, responds to sound and light with a repertoire of LED patterns, movements, inflations, deflations, whirs, clicks and jiggles.

For education in schools and high schools and mechatronics training in companies [[robot kits]] are becoming more and more popular. On the schools side there exists kits from [[LEGO]] , [[Parallax, Inc (company)|Parallax]], [[Fischertechnik]] and others (made of plastics components); Microbric[http://www.microbric.com], which uses its mainboard as a chassis & on the more professional side there exists e.g. the [[qfix robot kit]]; VexLABS robotics kit made of aluminium parts; and the [[iRobot Create]], which provides a fully assembled robot platform designed for expansion. Robots historically used in education include the [[turtle (robot)|turtle]] robots (strongly associated with the [[Logo programming language]]) and the [[Heathkit]] [[HERO (robot)|HERO]] series.

==History==
The idea of artificial people dates at least as far back as the ancient legend of [[Cadmus]], who sowed dragon teeth that turned into soldiers, and the myth of [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]], whose statue of [[Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]] came to life. In [[Greek mythology]], the deformed god of metalwork ([[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] or [[Hephaestus]]) created mechanical servants, ranging from intelligent, golden handmaidens to more utilitarian three-legged tables that could move about under their own power. Medieval [[Persia]]n [[alchemist]] [[Jabir ibn Hayyan]], inventor of many basic processes still used in [[chemistry]] today, included recipes for creating artificial [[snake]]s, [[scorpion]]s, and [[human]]s in his coded ''Book of Stones''. [[Jew]]ish legend tells of the [[Golem]], a clay statue animated by [[Kabbalism|Kabbalistic]] magic. Similarly, in the [[Younger Edda]], [[Norse mythology]] tells of a clay giant, Mökkurkálfi or Mistcalf, constructed to aid the troll Hrungnir in a duel with [[Thor]], the God of Thunder.

The word robot was introduced by Czech writer [[Karel Čapek]] in his play ''[[R.U.R.]]'' (Rossum's Universal Robots) which was written in 1920 (See also [[Robots in literature]] for details of the play). However, the verb ''robotovat'', meaning "to work" or "to slave", and the noun ''robota'' (meaning [[corvée]]) used in the Czech and Slovak languages, has been used since the early 10th century. It was suggested that the word ''robot'' had been coined by Karel Čapek's brother, painter and writer [[Josef Čapek]].  
[[Image:Roboraptor3.JPG|thumb|left|290px|[[Roboraptor]], a robotic dinosaur from Wowee toys]]
Concepts akin to today's robot can be found as long ago as 450 BC when the Greek mathematician [[Archytas]] of Tarentum postulated a mechanical bird he called "The Pigeon" which was propelled by [[steam]]. [[Heron of Alexandria]] (10AD-70AD) made numerous innovations in the field of automata, including (allegedly) one that could speak. [[Al-Jazari]] (1136-1206) an [[Ortoqid]] (Artuk) [[Arabs|Arab]] inventor designed and constructed automatic machines such as water clocks, kitchen appliances and musical automats powered by [[water]] (See one of his works at [http://www.finns-books.com/auto.htm]).

One of the first recorded designs of a humanoid robot was made by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452-1519) in around 1495.  Da Vinci's notebooks, rediscovered in the 1950s, contain detailed drawings of a mechanical [[knight]] able to sit up, wave its arms and move its head and jaw. The design is likely to be based on his anatomical research recorded in the ''[[Vitruvian Man]]''. It is not known whether he attempted to build the robot (see: [[Leonardo's robot]]).

An early [[automaton]] was created 1738 by [[Jacques de Vaucanson]], who created a mechanical duck that was able to eat grain, flap its wings, and excrete. 

Many consider the first robot in the modern sense to be a teleoperated boat, similar to a modern [[ROV]], devised by [[Nikola Tesla]] and demonstrated at an 1898 exhibition in [[Madison Square Garden]]. Based on his patents [http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00613809&homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft1.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D0613809.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F0613809%2526RS%3DPN%2F0613809&PageNum=&Rtype=&SectionNum=&idkey=NONE&Input=View+first+page  613,809], [http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=US000723188&SectionNum=1&IDKey=B94BCC802D4D&HomeUrl=http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526d=PALL%2526p=1%2526u=%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r=1%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526s1=0723188.PN.%2526OS=PN/0723188%2526RS=PN/0723188 723,188] and  [http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=US000725605&SectionNum=1&IDKey=3E96A5A13244&HomeUrl=http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526d=PALL%2526p=1%2526u=%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r=1%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526s1=0725605.PN.%2526OS=PN/0725605%2526RS=PN/0725605 725,605] for "teleautomation", Tesla hoped to develop the "wireless [[torpedo]]" into an automated weapon system for the US  Navy. (Cheney 1989) Tesla also proposed but did not build remotely operated war planes and ground vehicles. He also predicted these remote controlled machines were merely precursors of "machines possessed of their own intelligence" (Cheney 1989). See also the PBS website article (with photos) : [http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_robots.html Tesla - Master of Lightning: Race of Robots]

In the 1930s, [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] made a humanoid robot known as [[Elektro]]. It was exhibited at the 1939 and 1940 [[World's Fair]]s while the first electronic [[autonomous robot]]s were created by [[William Grey Walter|W. Grey Walter]] at [[Bristol University]], [[England]] in 1948.

The first human to be killed by a robot was 37 year-old [[Kenji Urada]], a Japanese factory worker, in 1981. According to the Economist.com, Urada "climbed over a safety fence at a [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] plant to carry out some maintenance work on a robot. In his haste, he failed to switch the robot off properly. Unable to sense him, the robot's powerful hydraulic arm kept on working and accidentally pushed the engineer into a grinding machine."

==Current developments==
[[Image:Robot hand holding an egg.jpg|thumb|right|Robotic manipulators can be very precise, but only when a task can be fully described.]]
The development of a robot with a natural human or animal [[gait]] is incredibly difficult and requires a large amount of computational power [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.07/race.html].  Now that background technologies of [[behavior]], [[navigation]] and path planning have been solved using basic wheeled robots, roboticists are moving on to develop walking robots (eg. [[SIGMO]], [[QRIO]], [[ASIMO]] & [[Hubo]]).  One approach to walk control is [[Passive dynamics]], where the robot's geometry is such that it will almost walk without active control.  

Initial work has focused on multi-legged robots (eg. [[Aibo]]), such as [[Hexapod (robotics)|hexapods]] [http://www.micromagic-sys.com/], as they are statically stable and so are easier to work with, whereas a bipedal robot must be able to balance.  The balancing problem is taken to an extreme by the [[Robotic unicycle]].  A problem with the development of robots with natural gaits is that human and animal bodies utilize a very large number of muscles in movement and replicating all of those mechanically is very difficult and expensive.  This field of robot research has become known as [[Biomorphic robotics]].

Progress is being made in the field of feedback and tactile sensors which allow a robot to sense their actions and adjust their behavior accordingly.  This is vital to enable robots to perform complex physical tasks that require some active control in response to the situation.

[[Robotic Surgery|Medical robotics]] is a growing field and regulatory approval has been granted for the use of robots in minimally invasive procedures.  Robots are being used in performing highly delicate, accurate surgery, or to allow a [[surgeon]] who is located remotely from their patient to perform a procedure using a robot controlled remotely. More recently, robots can be used autonomously in surgery [http://www.dlmag.com/1653/robot-successfully-completes-unassisted-heart-surgery.html].

Experimental winged robots and other examples exploiting [[biomimicry]] are also in early development.  So-called "[[nanomotor]]s" and "[[smart wire]]s" are expected to drastically simplify motive power, while in-flight stabilization seems likely to be improved by extremely small gyroscopes.  A significant driver of this work is military research into spy technologies.
[[Image:Seoul-Ubiquitous Dream 11.jpg|thumb|200px|Serving robot at the ''"Ubiquitous Dream"'' exhibition in Seoul, Korea on [[June 24]] [[2005]].]]
Energetically autonomous robots, is a field of study under the category of biologically inspired robotics, which aims to develop artificial agents that can remain self-sustainable in natural environments with minimum human intervention. This field of research spreads further into the fields of [[alternative energy sources]] and waste management, as it integrates the [[Microbial Fuel Cell]] technology with robotics, and allows for waste or food waste to be the 'fuel'. This class of robots is at the very early stages of development, however with great impact in applications such as the aforementioned unpleasant or dangerous for humans environments. Two examples of energetically autonomous robots that exist today are [[EcoBot]]s I and II. 

[[Internet bot]]s, also known as web robots, are automated internet applications controlled by software agents. The word "bot" in the term is a reference to the "robotic", mundane, repetitive tasks that the applications perform.{{fact}}[http://robots.net/article/1943.html Tactile sensors] and [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2005/vladskin.htmlartificial skin] are close to providing robots with a human-like sense of touch. The [[South Korea]]n government has set a goal of having a robot in every South Korean home by 2015-2020 [http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/04/02/business/robots.php].[http://robotfuturenews.blogspot.com/ Robot News] gives current news in robotic developments and 
[http://lis.epfl.ch/podcast Talking Robots Podcast] contains interviews with robotics professionals.

==Dangers and fears==
Although robots have not developed to the stage where they pose any threat or danger to [[society]] [http://www.mobilerobots.com/ethicalRobotics.html],  fears and concerns about robots have been repeatedly expressed in a wide range of books and films.  The principal theme is the robots' intelligence and ability to act could exceed that of humans, that they could develop a conscience and a motivation to take over or destroy the human race.  (See ''[[The Terminator]]'')

''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818), sometimes called the first science fiction novel, has become synonymous with the theme of a robot or monster advancing beyond its creator.  Probably the best known author to work in this area is [[Isaac Asimov]] who has placed robots and their interaction with society at the center of many of his works.  Of particular interest are Asimov's [[Three Laws of Robotics]]. Asimov also coined the term "Robotics" as the science or study of the technology associated with robots.

Currently, malicious programming or unsafe use of robots may be the biggest danger.  Although industrial robots may be smaller and less powerful than other industrial machines, they are just as capable of inflicting severe injury on humans. However, since a robot can be programmed to move in different trajectories depending on its task, its movement can be unpredictable for a person standing in its reach. Therefore, most industrial robots operate inside a security fence which separates them from human workers. [[Manuel De Landa]] has theorized that humans are at a critical and significant juncture where humans have allowed robots, "smart missiles," and autonomous bombs equipped with artificial perception to make decisions about killing us. He believes this represents an important and dangerous trend where humans are transferring more of our cognitive structures into our machines.<ref>Manuel De Landa, ''War in the Age of Intelligent Machines'' (New York: Zone Books, 1991</ref> Even without malicious programming, a robot, especially a future model moving freely in a human environment, is potentially dangerous because of its large moving masses, powerful actuators and unpredictably complex behavior. A robot falling on someone or just stepping on his foot by mistake could cause much more damage to the victim than a human being of the same size. Designing and programming robots to be [[intrinsically safe]] and to exhibit safe behavior in a human environment is one of the great challenges in robotics. Some people suggest that developing a robot with a conscience may be helpful in this regard.

==Literature==
{{main|Robots in literature}}
{{see also|List of fictional robots and androids}}

Robots have frequently appeared as characters in works of literature and the first use of the word "robot" in literature can be found in [[Karel Capek]]'s play ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]'', written in 1920.  [[Isaac Asimov]] has written many volumes of [[science fiction]] focusing on robots in numerous forms and guises [http://samvak.tripod.com/robot.html].  Asimov contributed greatly to reducing the [[Frankenstein complex]], which dominated early works of fiction involving robots.  His [[three laws of robotics]] have become particularly well known for codifying a simple set of behaviors for robots to remain at the service of their human creators.

Numerous words for different types of robots are now used in literature.  Robot has come to mean mechanical humans, while [[android]] is a generic term for artificial humans. [[Cyborg]] or "[[bionic]] man" is used for a human form that is a mixture of organic and mechanical parts. Organic artificial humans have also been referred to as "constructs" (or "biological constructs").

==Robotics==
{{main|Robotics}}

[[wikt:robotics|Robotics]] is the science and technology of robots, their design, manufacture, and application<ref>[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/robotics Definition of robotics - Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]</ref>. Robotics requires a working knowledge of [[electronics]], [[mechanics]], and [[software]]. A a person working in the field is a [[roboticist]].  The word ''robotics'' was first used in print by [[Isaac Asimov]], in his [[science fiction]] short story "[[Runaround]]" (1941). 

Although the appearance and capabilities of robots vary vastly, all robots share the features of a mechanical, movable structure under some form of control.  The [[structure]] of a robot is usually mostly [[machine|mechanical]] and can be called a [[Kinematics|kinematic chain]] (its functionality being akin to the skeleton of a body).  The chain is formed of links (its bones), [[actuator]]s (its muscles) and joints which can allow one or more degrees of freedom. Most contemporary robots use open serial chains in which each link connects the one before to the one after it. These robots are called  [http://www.roble.info/robotics/serial/html/SerialRobots-1se2.html serial robots] and often resemble the human arm. Some robots, such as the [[Stewart platform]], use closed parallel kinematic chains. Other structures, such as those that mimic the mechanical structure of humans, various animals and insects, are comparatively rare. However, the development and use of such structures in robots is an active area of research (e.g. [[biomechanics]]). Robots used as manipulators have an end effector mounted on the last link. This end effector can be anything from a welding device to a mechanical hand used to manipulate the environment.

The mechanical structure of a robot must be controlled to perform tasks. The control of a robot involves three distinct phases - perception, processing and action ([[robotic paradigms]]). [[Sensor]]s give information about the environment or the robot itself (e.g. the position of its joints or its end effector). Using strategies from the field of [[control theory]], this information is processed to calculate the appropriate signals to the actuators ([[Electric motor|motor]]s) which move the mechanical structure. The control of a robot involves various aspects such as path planning, pattern recognition, obstacle avoidance, etc. More complex and adaptable control strategies can be referred to as [[artificial intelligence]].

Any task involves the motion of the robot. The study of motion can be divided into [[kinematics]] and [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]]. Direct kinematics refers to the calculation of end effector position, orientation, [[velocity]] and [[acceleration]] when the corresponding joint values are known. Inverse kinematics refers to the opposite case in which required joint values are calculated for given end effector values, as done in path planning. Some special aspects of kinematics include handling of redundancy (different possibilities of performing the same movement), [[collision]] avoidance and [[singularity]] avoidance. Once all relevant positions, velocities and accelerations have been calculated using [[kinematics]], methods from the field of [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] are used to study the effect of [[forces]] upon these movements. Direct dynamics refers to the calculation of accelerations in the robot once the applied forces are known. Direct dynamics is used in [[computer simulations]] of the robot. Inverse dynamics refers to the calculation of the actuator forces necessary to create a prescribed end effector acceleration. This information can be used to improve the control algorithms of a robot.

In each area mentioned above, researchers strive to develop new concepts and strategies, improve existing ones and improve the interaction between these areas. To do this, criteria for "optimal" performance and ways to optimize design, structure and control of robots must be developed and implemented.

==Robots and Human-Machine interfaces==

Robotics has also application in the design of [[virtual reality]] interfaces. Specialized robots are in widespread use in the [[haptic]] research community. These robots, called "haptic interfaces" allow touch-enabled user interaction with real and virtual environments. Robotic forces allow simulating the mechanical properties of "virtual" objects, which users can experience through their sense of [[touch]] (see [http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17363&ch=biotech&sc=&pg=1 the MIT Technology review article "The Cutting Edge of Haptics"]).

==Competitions==
{{seealso|Robot competition|FIRST|FIRST Lego League|FIRST Vex™ Challenge}}

[[Image:Robocup Team Osaka's VisiON.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A robot practising for [[Robocup]]]]

[[Botball]] is a [[LEGO]]-based competition between fully [[autonomous]] robots. There are two divisions. The first is for high-school and middle-school students, and the second (called "Beyond Botball") is for anyone who chooses to compete at the national tournament. Teams build, program, and blog about a robot for five weeks before they compete at the [[regional]] level. Winners are awarded [[scholarships]] to register for and travel to the national tournament. Botball is a project of the [[KISS Institute for Practical Robotics]], based in Norman, Oklahoma.

The [[FIRST Robotics Competition]] is a multinational competition that teams professionals and young people to solve an engineering design problem. These teams of mentors (corporate, teachers, or college students) and high school students collaborate in order to design and build a robot in six weeks. This robot is designed to play a game that is developed by [[FIRST]] and changes from year to year. [[FIRST]], or For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology, is an organization that was founded by inventor [[Dean Kamen]] in 1992 as a way of getting high school students involved in and excited about engineering and technology. For more information visit [http://www.usfirst.org FIRST's website].

The [[FIRST Vex™ Challenge]] (FVC) is a mid-level [[robotics]] competition targeted toward high-school aged students. It offers the traditional challenge of a FIRST competition but with a more accessible and affordable robotics kit. The ultimate goal of FVC is to reach more young people with a lower-cost, more accessible opportunity to discover the excitement and rewards of science, technology, and engineering. For more information visit [http://www.usfirst.org/vex/ The FIRST Vex Challenge website].

[[FIRST Lego League]] (also known by its acronym FLL) is a robotics competition for elementary and middle school students (ages 9-14, 9-16 in Europe), arranged by the [[FIRST]] organization. Each year the contest focuses on a different topic related to the sciences. Each challenge within the competition then revolves around that theme. The students then work out solutions to the various problems that they're given and meet for regional tournaments to share their knowledge and show off their ideas. For more information visit [http://www.usfirst.org/jrobtcs/flego.htm First Lego League's website]. 

Competitions for [[talha robots]] are gaining popularity and competitions now exist catering for a wide variety of robot builders ranging from schools [http://www.usfirst.org/] to research institutions.  Robots compete at a wide range of tasks including [[Robot combat|combat]], fire-fighting [http://www.trincoll.edu/events/robot], playing games [http://www.cooper.edu/~mar/mobile_robots_fall2005.html], maze solving, performing tasks [http://maslab.csail.mit.edu/] and navigational exercises (eg. [[DARPA Grand Challenge]]) [http://www.betterhumans.com/News/news.aspx?articleID=2003-01-09-10] [http://www.me.vt.edu/grandchallenge/]

Most recently, [[Duke University]] announced plans to host the [[Duke Annual Robo-Climb Competition]] (DARC) aimed to challenge students to create innovative wall-climbing robots that can autonomously ascend vertical surfaces. For more information visit [http://robotics.pratt.duke.edu/roboclimb/index.htm DARC's Website]

A competition that has existed for several years is the [[DARPA Grand Challenge]], pitting [[driverless car]]s against each other in an obstacle course across the desert.
