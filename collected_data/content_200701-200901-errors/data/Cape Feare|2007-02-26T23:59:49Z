"'''Cape Feare'''" is the second episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 5)|fifth season]], which premiered on the [[Fox network]] on [[October 7]], [[1993]].<ref name="book"/> It is an episode that features the character of [[Sideshow Bob]] trying to kill [[Bart Simpson]] after getting out of jail. The episode is a spoof of the 1962 film ''[[Cape Fear (1962 movie)|Cape Fear]]'' as well as its [[Cape Fear (1991 film)|1991 remake]].

The episode was written by [[Jon Vitti]] and directed by [[Rich Moore]].<ref name="book"/> [[Kelsey Grammer]] guest stars as Sideshow Bob.<ref name="book"/> It was a holdover episode from season four for which [[Al Jean]] and [[Mike Reiss]] were show runners. This is the last episode to be written by the original writing staff.

==Synopsis==
{{spoiler}}
Bart gets many letters, which contain threats to kill him, all written in blood. Bart is left on edge by this, which results in his overreacting to several innocuous situations. The scene switches to the [[Springfield (Simpsons)|Springfield]] State Prison, and the viewer sees that the writer is Sideshow Bob. The next day, Sideshow Bob's parole hearing is up. [[Clancy Wiggum|Chief Wiggum]] and [[Selma Bouvier|Selma]] give their testimonies, which Sideshow Bob's lawyer rebuffs. Sideshow Bob promises that he is no threat to Bart and is paroled. When the Simpson family goes to watch a movie, Sideshow Bob is there sitting in front of them, smoking a cigar and laughing quite exaggeratedly. The family then realizes that it was he who sent those letters.

The Simpson family then tries to protect themselves from Sideshow Bob. At the Simpson home, Chief Wiggum helps set up a network of trap strings attached to a [[Krusty the Clown|Krusty]] doll. [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] goes to a shady-looking vigilante, who promises to run Sideshow Bob out of town, but actually pleads with him and fails. The next day, Sideshow Bob goes around Evergreen Terrace in an ice-cream truck, calling out the names of all the people whom he ''will not'' kill, and Bart's name is not on that list.

The Simpsons decide to opt for the [[FBI]]'s [[Witness Protection Program|Witness Relocation Program]] and move to Terror Lake, with new identities and a new houseboat in which to live. As they drive in the car, the viewer sees that Sideshow Bob has strapped himself to the underside of the car. They go inside their houseboat and Sideshow Bob gets out from under the car and steps on a set of rakes repeatedly. As Bart later walks down the road, he hears Sideshow Bob's sinister voice and sees him extricate himself from the underside of another car. Bart runs home and warns his parents.

After night falls, Sideshow Bob arrives on the houseboat and cuts it loose from the dock. After tying up the other family members, Bob grabs his knife and enters Bart's room. However, Bart escapes out the window and tries to hide from Sideshow Bob, but he cannot jump off the boat, as there are crocodiles and electric eels in the water. He sees that they are 15&nbsp;miles from Springfield. Sideshow Bob advances on Bart and asks if he has any last requests. Thinking fast, Bart asks Sideshow Bob to sing the entire score to the ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', much to Sideshow Bob's delight and he obliges. After he finishes, he advances on Bart again, but the boat runs aground and Sideshow Bob is apprehended by the police there. He is taken away and the Simpsons return home.

==Production==
Even though the episode aired during the beginning of the fifth season, it was produced by the crew of the fourth season.<ref name="vitti">{{cite video | people=Vitti, Jon|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Cape Feare"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The holdover episodes from season four were "[[Homer's Barbershop Quartet]]" and this episode. A large part of the original crew left the show after season four in order to pursue new challenges.<ref name="vitti"/> This led to the addition of several scenes, which normally would not have been considered, because the mentality of the departing crew was "what are they going to do, get us fired?"<ref name="vitti"/> Although most of the episode was completed by the staff of season four, the end was rewritten by the team of season five.<ref name="jean">{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Cape Feare"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

[[Wallace Wolodarsky]] had seen the 1991 version of ''Cape Fear'' and pitched the idea of making a spoof of the film.<ref name="jean"/> Jon Vitti was then assigned to write a spoof of the original film from 1962 as well as the remake.<ref name="jean"/> Instead of using the spoof as only a part of the episode, which could also have contained a B-story, the entire episode was devoted to this parody. Sideshow Bob was cast as the villain and Bart became the main victim. The episode followed the same basic plot outline as the films and used the score by [[Bernard Herrmann]], which after this episode became Sideshow Bob's theme.<ref name="jean"/> This episode marked the first time a Sideshow Bob episode was not a mystery.<ref name="vitti"/>

[[Image:Rake Joke.png|thumb|left|Screenshot of the rake sequence]]
Compared to previously produced episodes, this episode featured a lot of elements that could be described as silly and cartoonish. This was a result of the staff's careless attitude towards the end of season four. Al Jean has compared Sideshow Bob to [[Wile E. Coyote]], after he was stomped on by multiple elephants and bounced right back from it.<ref name="jean"/> The scene towards the end where Sideshow Bob performs the ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' was unrealistic with Bart having popcorn and a ''Playbill'' magazine as well as Sideshow Bob having a navy costume while he performs in front of the [[Union Jack]]. This was added after the [[animatics]], because the crew felt that watching a guy singing would not be interesting enough and they had to include these gags to make it work.<ref name="jean"/> [[Matt Groening]] was surprised when he saw the additions, because he thought that these silly gags would not appear in the final cut, but he does like them now.<ref name="groening"/>

There were difficulties getting this episode up to the minimum length of an episode.<ref name="jean"/> Because of that many scenes were added in post-production.<ref name="jean"/> The episode starts with a repeat of a [[couch gag]] that was first used in the episode "[[Lisa's First Word]]", which is considerably longer than the average length of a cough gag. The crew added an [[Itchy & Scratchy]] cartoon and a few misleads as to whom was trying to kill Bart.<ref name="jean"/> Even with all of these additions, the episode still ran short of time. This led to the creation of the [[rake (tool)|rake]] sequence, which became a memorable moment for this episode.<ref name="jean"/> Originally, Sideshow Bob was only supposed to step on one rake after he stepped out from the underside of the Simpson family's car, but this was changed to nine rakes in a row.<ref name="jean"/> The idea was to make it funny, then unfunny and later funny again.<ref name="jean"/> Sideshow Bob has stepped on rakes in two other episodes, "[[Day of the Jackanapes]]" and "[[The Italian Bob]]".

Kelsey Grammer was brought in to guest star as Sideshow Bob for the third time.<ref name="book"/> At that time Grammer had become a household name, as the lead of the television series ''[[Frasier]]'', which was in production at the same time as this episode.<ref name="jean"/> Grammer did not know that the rake scene was extended, because he had only done the moan once and was surprised when he saw the final product.<ref name="jean"/>

==Cultural references==
[[Image:Bates Motel.png|thumb|right|Bates Motel is a reference to Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film ''Psycho'']]
Besides borrowing the overall plot structure of the ''Cape Fear'' films, the episode made several direct references to specific scenes from the films, including: [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] going to Chief Wiggum only to be told that Sideshow Bob has not broken any laws, Sideshow Bob getting out of prison, the scene in the movie theatre, and Sideshow Bob hiding under the Simpson family's car, which was a reference to the 1991 remake.<ref name="jean"/> The episode also contains elements of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1960 film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' with Sideshow Bob staying at Bates Motel.<ref name="book"/> Homer surprising Bart with his new hockey mask recalls the film ''[[Friday the 13th Part 3]]''<ref name="BBC"/> and Homer's hat and singing during the car trip to Terror Lake alludes to ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.<ref name="jean"/>
