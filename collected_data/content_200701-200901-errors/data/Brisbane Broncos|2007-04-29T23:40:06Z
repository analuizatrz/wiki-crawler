The '''Brisbane Broncos''' are a professional [[rugby league football]] team based in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. The Broncos play in the Australasian first-grade competition, the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) premiership. Of the nineteen seasons the Broncos have competed in they have won the premiership six times, making them one of the most successful clubs in the league.

The club was founded in 1988 and, together with the [[Gold Coast-Tweed Giants]], was one of the first clubs from the state of Queensland to participate in the [[Winfield Cup|New South Wales Rugby League]] competition. The Broncos played a significant role in the following [[Super League (Australia)|Super League War]] before continuing to compete successfully in the [[National Rugby League]] competition.

The Brisbane Broncos are the only publicly listed sporting club on the [[Australian Stock Exchange]], trading as Brisbane Broncos Limited ({{asx|BBL}}). The parent of the Brisbane Broncos is Nationwide News Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of [[News Limited]], which, as of 27 February 2007, owns 68.83% of Broncos shares.<ref>{{cite web | title=Brisbane Broncos 2006 Annual Report (Page 25)|url=http://www.broncos.com.au/Content/Attachment/Brisbane%20Broncos%20Limited%202006%20Annual%20Report.pdf| accessdate=2007-04-22}} </ref>

==History==
{{Main|Brisbane Broncos History}}
[[Queensland Maroons|Queensland]]’s success in the 1980s [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]], in addition to the inclusion of a Brisbane team in the [[Amco Cup|mid-week competition]], convinced the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership|New South Wales Rugby League]] to invite a Queensland-based team into the competition.<ref name="broncshistory">{{cite book | author=Whiticker, Alan & Collis, Ian | title= The History of Rugby League Clubs
| publisher=New Holland Publishers (Australia) Pty Ltd | year=2004| id=ISBN 1-74110-075-5}}</ref> After tough competition between the various syndicates for the Brisbane license, the [[Queensland Rugby League]] chose the bid that belonged to former [[Brisbane Rugby League]] players, [[Barry Maranta]] and [[Paul Morgan (rugby league footballer)|Paul "Porky" Morgan]].<ref name="broncshistory">{{cite book | author=Whiticker, Alan & Collis, Ian | title= The History of Rugby League Clubs

The Broncos secured the services of [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league footballer)|Wayne Bennett]], who is still the club's coach 20 years later.<ref name="broncshistory">{{cite book | author=Whiticker, Alan & Collis, Ian | title= The History of Rugby League Clubs
| publisher=New Holland Publishers (Australia) Pty Ltd | year=2004| id=ISBN 1-74110-075-5}}</ref>The Broncos made their [[Brisbane Broncos 1988|first grade debut in 1988]] against reigning [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership|NSWRL]] premiers [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah]], defeating them 44-10. Although they made a promising start to their maiden season, they failed to make the finals. Despite missing out [[Brisbane Broncos 1989|again in 1989]], they won the [[Amco Cup|Panasonic Cup]], the midweek knockout competition.  They first tasted [[Brisbane Broncos 1992#1992 Grand Final|premiership success in 1992]], and [[Brisbane Broncos 1993#1993 Grand Final|again in 1993]], both times against the [[St. George Dragons]]. 

In [[Brisbane Broncos 1995|1995]], the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League War]] broke out.  After threats of expulsion from the NSWRL, the Brisbane Broncos were one of the first clubs to sign with the new league and all players followed suit. The Broncos CEO [[John Ribot]] moved to take over the running of the rebel Super League, leading to a common perception that the war was orchestrated by the club.<ref name="broncshistory">{{cite book | author=Whiticker, Alan & Collis, Ian | title= The History of Rugby League Clubs

[[Brisbane Broncos 1999|1999]] was a disappointing year for the club, with a terrible start to the season meaning that they were never premiership contenders. Club legend [[Allan Langer]] retired mid-season but the club made a turnaround mid-season winning 11 consecutive games in a row to qualify for the finals in eighth position but were easily disposed of 42-20 by the [[Cronulla Sharks]] in week one of the finals series.  The Broncos' fifth premiership came in 2000, when the club defeated the [[Sydney Roosters]] in the last day-time [[Brisbane Broncos 2000#2000 Grand Final|NRL Grand Final]], and it also saw the retirement of [[Kevin Walters]] and stalwart [[Michael Hancock (rugby league footballer)|Michael Hancock]]. 

[[Brisbane Broncos 2002|2002]] saw the return of [[Allan Langer]] for a one year stint, before retiring for the final time. It was also the beginning of Brisbane's recurring "post origin slump", which haunted the club for the next five years. This is perhaps due to the many players who represent the [[Queensland Maroons]] in the [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin series]] which with the extra workload may cause a loss of form. The Brisbane Broncos averages about 7 players out for every Origin game which impacts on their form.<ref>{{cite web | title=Brisbane Broncos - Representative Players|url=http://www.broncos.com.au/index.cfm?MenuID=330&TopMenuID=266| accessdate=2007-04-21}} </ref> This "post origin slump" is seen in 2003, when the Broncos, coming first on the ladder after 17 rounds, go onto lose 10 of their last 11 games to just make the finals.  The [[Brisbane Broncos 2004|2004]] and [[Brisbane Broncos 2005|2005]] seasons fared better, with the Broncos ending up 3rd on the ladder but losing games at the wrong end of the season which saw them bow out of premiership contention.

In [[Brisbane Broncos 2006|2006]], after strong performance through most of the season the Broncos again entered the post-Origin slump, losing 5 games straight. However they appeared to turn things around and entered the finals, winning 6 of their last 7 games including the grand final against The [[Melbourne Storm]] which they won 15-8, keeping their perfect record in Grand Finals intact.

==Emblem==
[[Image:brisbane 1988.jpg|thumb|150px|The club's original logo, used from 1988 to 1999.]]
It had originally been planned for the Brisbane Broncos to adopt a logo incorporating both a [[kangaroo]] and a stylised "Q" which had been featured in the logo for the [[Queensland Rugby League]] for many years. However, with the [[Australian national rugby league team]] also known as the Kangaroos, this step was deemed inappropriate and conflicting. The [[Cooktown Orchid]] which had long been used by Brisbane clubs in the [[Bulimba Cup (rugby league competition)|Bulimba Cup]] was also ruled out along with other [[Fauna of Australia|Australian animals]] like the [[brumby]], [[possum]], [[galah]] and the [[kookaburra]], which was used on Brisbane's Kookaburra Queen [[Paddle steamer|paddleships]].<ref name="broncsteamtobeat">{{cite book | author=Gallaway, Jack | title=The Brisbane Broncos: The Team To Beat | publisher=University of Queensland Press | year=2001 | id=ISBN 0-7022-3275-0}}</ref> Having wanted to continue with the use of [[alliteration]] for local sporting teams such as the [[Brisbane Bullets]] and [[Brisbane Bears]], the club's directors eventually decided on the nickname [[Bronco]]s.<ref name="broncshistory">{{cite book | author=Whiticker, Alan & Collis, Ian | title= The History of Rugby League Clubs | publisher=New Holland Publishers (Australia) Pty Ltd | year=2004 | id=ISBN 1-74110-075-5}}</ref>

The original club logo was first featured in the [[Brisbane Broncos 1988|Broncos' inaugural season]] in the premiership in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1988|1988]] and was used up until [[National Rugby League season 1999|1999]]. It used a mostly [[gold]] colour scheme, in line with the predominant colour on the team jerseys. In 2000, the club adopted a new logo with a more [[maroon]] design; much closer to the traditional colour associated with [[Queensland]] rugby league and sport in general. This design continues to be used to date.

==Colours==
Traditionally, the colours of the Brisbane Broncos have been [[maroon]], white and gold, which have all long been linked to the history of rugby league in Queensland. Initially the founders of the club favoured the official blue and gold colours of [[Brisbane City Council]], however, Sydney advertiser [[John Singleton]] advised the board that "Queenslanders had been booing players wearing blue for more than three-quarters of a century."<ref name="broncsteamtobeat">{{cite book | author=Gallaway, Jack   | title=The Brisbane Broncos: The Team To Beat   | publisher=University of Queensland Press   | year=2002  | id=ISBN 0-7022-3275-0}}</ref> As a result, the traditional maroon and white colours of Brisbane Bullimba Cup sides along with gold, symbolising the Queensland sunshine<ref name="broncsteamtobeat">{{cite book | author=Gallaway, Jack   | title=The Brisbane Broncos: The Team To Beat   | publisher=University of Queensland Press   | year=2002  | id=ISBN 0-7022-3275-0}}</ref>, were adopted as the club's colours.

In the inaugural 1988 season, the club's jersey design featured the top third being gold, the middle being alternating hoops of maroon and white with the bottom third being maroon. Although this design with gold being featured strongly did not please everyone, the jersey had to differentiate from both the maroon and white of [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] and the maroon of the Queensland [[State of Origin]] team.<ref>{{cite web | title=Rugby League History - RL1908.com - Brisbane Broncos | url=http://www.rl1908.com/Clubs/Brisbane-Broncos.htm | accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref> Following a number of design changes in the 1990s including a predominantly white jersey from 1997 to 1998, blue was added to the jersey in 2001 as a minor colour to show the aforementioned historical link with the colours of Brisbane. However, this was later dropped from the design in favour of a mainly marron jersey with gold trim.

At the 1995 [[Rugby League World Sevens]] tournament tournament the club introduced a new combination of jersey colours - mauve, aqua and white. Brisbane Broncos Marketing Manager Shane Edwards stated that it "will become our Sevens strip... but we will never change the Broncos' colours."<ref> Bronco! Magazine Issue 1, 1995 </ref> In 2001, following the release of the club's predominantly navy-blue and maroon away jersey, the [[National Rugby League]] ordered the club to produce a third jersey since the new away jersey clashed with the home jerseys of the [[Penrith Panthers]], [[Melbourne Storm]] and [[New Zealand Warriors]]. An aqua strip using the same design as the jerseys used from 1999 to 2001 was worn and was much derided by the local media. However, following two years of public pressure the club dropped the jersey in favour of the design worn against Newcastle at 2003; the first match back at the refurbished [[Suncorp Stadium]].

==Stadium==
{{Main|Brisbane Broncos Stadiums}}
[[Image:Last broncos game at anz.jpg|thumb|250px|The Brisbane Broncos, at the then-ANZ Stadium (1993-2003).]]
In their first five seasons from 1988 to 1992, the Brisbane Broncos played their matches at [[Lang Park]], the ground considered to be the home of rugby league in Queensland. However, following ongoing conflict with the [[Queensland Rugby League]] and Lang Park Trust, the team relocated to [[ANZ Stadium]] in 1993.<ref name="broncs1908">{{cite web | title=Brisbane Broncos History RL1908 |url=http://www.rl1908.com/Clubs/Brisbane-Broncos.htm | accessdate=2007-04-06}}</ref> The club's home match attendance, which had averaged 19,637 at Lang Park, increased to 43,200 at the new ground in the first season following the club's premiership title in the previous season.<ref name="broncscrowd">{{cite web | title=Rugby League Tables / Attendances Brisbane |url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/brisbane.html | accessdate=2007-04-06}}</ref> However, despite winning a second premiership in 1993, crowds gradually declined with the club failing to register more than the 23,712 average they achieved in 1996 up until 2002, depsite winning a further three premierships.

[[Image:Suncorp Stadium.jpg|thumb|250px|left|View of the current Brisbane Broncos home ground, Suncorp Stadium.]]
With the Queensland Government's $280,000,000 redevelopment of Lang Park<ref>{{cite web | title=Suncopr Stadium Land Park Redevelopment |url=http://www.arup.com/australasia/project.cfm?pageid=1354 | accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref>, the team moved back to the refurbished stadium upon its completition in mid-2003. The more centrally-located [[Suncorp Stadium]], renamed through sponsorship, has begun to attract increasingly higher crowds since then, with the average attendance in 2006 being 31,208, significantly higher than the [[Newcastle Knights]] with 21,848 and more than double the regular season competition average of 15,601.<ref name="broncscrowd">{{cite web | title=Rugby League Tables / Attendances Brisbane |url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/brisbane.html | accessdate=2007-04-06}}</ref>

The club record attendance for a regular season match is 58,593, set against the [[St. George Dragons]] in the final round of the [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1993|1993 season]]. The record attendance for a match at [[Suncorp Stadium]] is 50,416, set in the opening round of the [[National Rugby League season 2007|2007 season]] against the [[North Queensland Cowboys]].<ref name="broncscrowd">{{cite web | title=Rugby League Tables / Attendances Brisbane |url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/brisbane.html | accessdate=2007-04-06}}</ref>

==Statistics and records==
{{details|Brisbane Broncos Records}}
The Brisbane Broncos are the most successful club in the history of the competition in terms of percentage of total games won, having won 65.80% of their games since their inception, more than 5% better than the second-placed club.<ref>{{cite web | title=Rugby League Tables / Win-Loss Records / All Teams | url=http://www.stats.rleague.com/rl/teams/all/overall_wl.html | accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref> In their nineteen completed seasons, the club has made a total of six Grand Finals, winning each time, and have made the finals for the past fifteen seasons. They are one of only two clubs to have won the [[World Club Challenge]] twice, and were the first club to do so on British soil.

[[Michael Hancock (rugby league footballer)|Michael Hancock]] holds the record for the most First Grade games for the club, having played a total of 279. Current team captain [[Darren Lockyer]] has played 267 to date, and may pass this mark as early as [[National Rugby League season 2007|2007]].

Darren Lockyer holds the record for the most points scored for the club, tallying 1,117 since his debut in 1995. He also holds the club record of 272 points in a season, having achieved this in 1998. [[Steve Renouf]] holds the record for the most career tries for the club with 142. Renouf also shares the club record for the most number of tries in a season with [[Darren Smith (rugby league footballer)|Darren Smith]] at 23. [[Lote Tuqiri]]'s tally of 26 points from three tries and seven goals in a single match against the [[Northern Eagles]] remains the club record for most individual points in a game. Both Lockyer and [[Michael De Vere]] (formerly the club's leading point scorer) have the record of nine goals in a single game.<ref name="broncsrecords">2006 Official Rugby League Annual. Edited by David Middleton, Published by News Magazines, Surrey Hills, Sydney</ref> Four players have scored four tries in a match for the Brisbane Broncos including [[Steve Renouf]], [[Wendell Sailor]], [[Karmichael Hunt]] and [[Justin Hodges]].<ref name="broncsrecords">2006 Official Rugby League Annual. Edited by David Middleton, Published by News Magazines, Surrey Hills, Sydney</ref> Renouf achieved this feat fives times from 1991 to 1998.

The club's biggest winning margin is 54 points, achieved twice in 1998 in a 58–4 victory over the [[North Queensland Cowboys]] and a 60–6 victory over the [[North Sydney Bears]]. Their heaviest defeat was against the [[Melbourne Storm]] in 2005: a 50–4 loss.<ref name="broncsrecords">2006 Official Rugby League Annual.

==Notable players==
:''For a full list of Broncos representatives, see [[Brisbane Broncos Representatives]]''
The representative playing list of the Brisbane Broncos is extensive due to the club's premiership success, its not having missed a finals series in over a decade, and its being the dominant Queensland team in the competition for the majority of its participation. The latter, in particular, has resulted in a large number of [[Queensland Maroons]] in the team. Listed below is the club's "Team of All Time"<ref>{{cite book | author=Webcke, Shane with Heads, Ian   | title=Warhorse: Life, Football and Other Battles| publisher=Pan Macmillan Australia Press   | year=2006  | id=ISBN 1-4050-3752-0}}</ref> and features many of the club's greatest players, all of whom have gone on to represent their state and national teams.
