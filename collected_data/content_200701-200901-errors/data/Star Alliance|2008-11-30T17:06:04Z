'''Star Alliance''' is the world's first and largest [[airline alliance]]. Founded in 1997, its name and emblem represent the five founding airlines, [[Air Canada]], [[Lufthansa]], [[Scandinavian Airlines System]], [[Thai Airways International]], and [[United Airlines]]. Star Alliance has since grown considerably and now has 21 full and 3 regional members, with another four expected to become full members by 2009.

== Customer service==

[[Codeshare agreement|Codeshare]] flights between these airlines are, for the most part, seamless. This tight cooperation led to suspicions of anti-competitive behavior, and the alliance was investigated by the [[European Union]] as a virtual merger of its members. Indeed, some speculated that if government regulations were relaxed, the members would merge into a single corporation<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/speeches/text/sp1999678_en.html Current issues arising with airline alliances: panel discussion. EUROPEAN AIR LAW ASSOCIATION. 11th Annual Conference. Recent developments in European air transport law and policy Lisbon, November 5, 1999]</ref>, although no evidence has yet materialized. Prior to Star Alliance, [[Northwest Airlines]] and [[KLM]] were operating together as the forerunners of the modern airline alliance system since 1993, although there had been even earlier pairings and groupings of airlines for decades on a less formal level. The creation of Star Alliance was a milestone in airline history because of its size. It sparked the formation of rivals, notably [[SkyTeam]] and [[Oneworld]].

The alliance developed the "regional" concept in 2004, which helps Star Alliance penetrate individual markets with the regional participation of smaller carriers. Regional Star Alliance members have to be sponsored by an existing full Star Alliance member.

Star Alliance members now fly 18,100 daily flights to 975 airports in 162 countries with a fleet of 3,359 aircraft. Its members carried a total of 405.7 million passengers with a turnover of US$95.3 billion in 2006. The alliance's market share is 28% of the global market based on revenue passenger kilometers (RPK). All Star Alliance carriers combined employ over 401,577 [[aviator|pilots]], [[flight attendant]]s, and other staff. Star Alliance was voted best airline alliance in the [[Skytrax]] 2007 World Airline Awards.<ref>{{cite web|year=2007|publisher=Skytrax|url=http://www.worldairlineawards.com/Awards_2007/Allnc.htm|title=2007 World Airlines Awards{{ndash}} Best Alliance|accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref>

==Co-location (move under one roof)==

*In March 2008, some Star Alliance members started to move to Terminal 1 of [[London Heathrow Airport]] as part of a re-arrangement program. [[Star Alliance]] members [[Air New Zealand]] and [[United Airlines]] moved into Terminal 1 on [[10 June]] [[2008]]. Members [[Austrian Airlines]], [[Croatia Airlines]], [[Lufthansa]], [[Swiss International Airlines]], and [[TAP Portugal]] will move to Terminal 1 in late 2008 early 2009. [[Asiana]], [[BMI (airline)|BMI]], [[LOT Polish Airlines]], [[South African Airways]] and [[US Airways]] already operate from Terminal 1. All other members will remain at T3 until Heathrow East is completed, where all members will then move.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staralliance.com/en/press/press_releases/2008/lhr_terminal_1_mar_08.html |title=Star Alliance Gears Up For Terminal Moves at London Heathrow |publisher=Star Alliance |accessdate=2008-03-27}}</ref>
*On [[March 26]], [[2008]], all Star Alliance members moved operations to the new Terminal 3 of [[Beijing Capital International Airport]] in order to maintain simple transfers with [[Air China]] and other Star Alliance airline members.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://atwonline.com/news/story.html?storyID=11113 ATW: Star Alliance has eye on India as Air China, Shanghai Airlines prepare to join]</ref>[[Continental Airlines]], which is currently at Terminal 2 of BCIA, will move to Terminal 3 in 2009 once regulatory approval has been granted. It is currently part of [[Skyteam]].
*Since the remodeling of [[Mexico City International Airport]]'s Terminal 1, all Star Alliance carriers were re-located to the Hall F2 of the terminal's International Building. United Airlines, Air Canada, Lufthansa, and US Airways now have their check-in facilities inside a single hall. The gate assignation for Star Alliance member airline varies, although they tend to operate into the 'F' gates. (F20-F28)
*At the same time as the move at Beijing Capital International Airport, all Star Alliance members are also expected to move to the new Terminal 2 at [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]] to maintain simple transfers with [[Air China]], [[Shanghai Airlines]] and other Star Alliance airline members.<ref name="autogenerated1" />
*During the renovation of [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport]]'s Terminal 1, all Star Alliance members but Air Canada, Austrian Airlines, Swiss International Airlines and future members (Continental Airlines and Air India, whose service will end in winter 2008) were re-located there, in order to "create" a Star Alliance Hub.
*International Star Alliance departures and arrivals serving [[San Francisco International Airport]] moved to [[San Francisco International Airport#Boarding Area G .28Gates G91-G102.29|Boarding Area G]] except for those of Air Canada and [[Asiana Airlines]].
*In June 2006, all Star Alliance member airlines except [[Air New Zealand]] moved to the new South Wing in Terminal 1 of [[Narita International Airport]] to simplify transfers with [[All Nippon Airways]].
*Star Alliance members serving [[Cairo International Airport]] will also move to the new Terminal 3 once the terminal opens in fall 2008 to simplify transfers with [[EgyptAir]]. <ref>[http://www.egyptair.com.eg/English/AboutEgyptAir/NewsPress/star_alliance.htm EgyptAir » About EgyptAir » News and Press » EgyptAir to join Star Alliance ,last update<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
*All Star Alliance members at [[Miami International Airport]] (Air Canada, United, US Airways, Lufthansa and Swiss) relocated to the newly built Concourse J, as part of the airport's "alliance co-location" program; Star Alliance was a major contributor to the new Concourse and overall Terminal construction.
*In June 2008, Star Alliance member airlines were relocated to the west side of [[Incheon International Airport]] as part of the airport's renewal program, followed by the opening of the new Concourse A.
*US Airways joined Star Alliance Partners Air Canada, United, Lufthansa, Austrian and LOT Polish in Terminal 1 at [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]] in March 2008. They had previously been in Terminal 3.
*In March 2008, Star Alliance member airlines were relocated to Terminal 2 at Warsaw's [[Frederic Chopin Airport]].

==Logo on aircraft==
Some Star Alliance members paint some of their planes with the Star Alliance livery, usually featuring a white fuselage with "Star Alliance" signature written across and a black tailfin with the Star Alliance logo. Singapore Airlines however, is the only member to not paint the tail of star alliance aircraft. Instead they paint it with the SIA logo. [[Asiana Airlines]] was the first Star Alliance member to paint their aircraft in Star Alliance livery.
Aircraft painted in the airlines' own livery have the Star Alliance logo painted behind the cockpit. The logo has a diameter of approximately 70 cm.

==Member airlines==

Starting in 2004, Star Alliance has divided its member airlines into "full members" and "regional members". Before being accepted as a regional member, airline must be sponsored by a full member.
Full members may have some affiliate airlines (that either are owned by or are in a contractual relationship with a Star Alliance full member). Affiliate airlines fall under full member umbrella in respect to the Star Alliance rules, policies and benefits. All of the affiliate airlines grant Star Alliance frequent flyer benefits, and usually feature the Star Alliance logo on their aircraft, public relation materials and advertisement. In some cases (such as [[Air New Zealand]] link airlines and [[bmi regional]]) the branding of the "parent" full member may be so strong as to mean passengers are unaware of the affiliate's independent existence.
