'''Omar Ahmed Khadr''' ([[September 19]] [[1986]] - ) is the 4<sup>th</sup> child in the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Khadr family]]. He has been imprisoned in the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]s since he was captured at the age of 15 following a 2002 firefight between American troops and militants in Afghanistan. He is accused of throwing a grenade that killed a US soldier, leading to charges of war crimes and providing support to terrorism.<ref name=DoDList2>[http://www.dod.mil/news/May2006/d20060515%20List.pdf list of prisoners (.pdf)], ''[[US Department of Defense]]'', [[May 15]] [[2006]]</ref>

In February 2008, the Pentagon accidentally released documents that revealed that although Khadr was present during the firefight, there was no other evidence that he had thrown the grenade.

In [[1992]], Khadr's father stepped on a land-mine while in [[Lowgar Province|Lowgar, Afghanistan]] and nearly died; the Khadr family moved back to Toronto so he could recuperate. Once the family moved back to Toronto, Omar became "hypersensitive to tension in the family" and would often quote [[Captain Haddock]] from [[The Adventures of Tintin]].<ref name="unending" /> Enrolled at [[ISNA Elementary School]], Omar's teachers described him as "very smart, very eager and very polite".<ref name="unending" />

Following the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 embassy bombings]], the United States retaliated by [[Operation Infinite Reach#Attack on camps in Afghanistan|bombing camps in Afghanistan]]. Thus, expecting a similar retaliation following the [[9/11|September 11th attacks]] in 2001, the 14-year old Omar followed his father into the mountains, where he washed laundry and cooked meals for the group of militants.<ref name="unending" />

It is uncertain where Khadr was throughout much of 2001 and 2002, but he is believed to have remained with his father.<ref name="repat">[http://www.cla-ace.ca/khadrrepatriation.pdf Repatriation of Omar Khadr to be Tried under Canadian Law], Brief Submitted to Senate Standing Committee on Human Rights, January 2008</ref>

==The Firefight and Capture==
{{wikisource|OC-1 CITF witness report}}
[[Image:Alleged Khadr 3.png|thumb|275px|A youth alleged to be Khadr, handling explosives.]]The 15-year old Khadr was captured following a four-hour<ref name="cbc" /> firefight in the village of [[Ab Khail]]. It was considered the first major engagement since [[Operation Anaconda]] had ended four months earlier.<ref name="purple" /> 

A later collection of biographies written by [[al Qaeda]] praising fighters in the country mentions Omar in its article on his "martyred" father. It praises the the elder Khadr for "tossing his little child in the furnace of the battle", and likens his son to a [[lion cub]].<ref>[[CBC]], "[http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2008/02/07/khadr-bio.html Khadr patriarch disliked Canada, says al-Qaeda biography]", February 7, 2008</ref>

According to his brother [[Abdurrahman Khadr]], Omar had been sent to accompany three of the men visiting the residence, to serve as a translator for the gathered Mujahideen at his father's request - since he was fluent in the local [[Pashto]] dialect, as well as Arabic and English. He had previously been asked to serve as a translator for [[Abu Laith al-Libi]].<ref name="thestar" /> His involvement as a translator was against his mother's wishes, and she wasn't aware he had been sent out that day.<ref name=LATimes20070623/><ref>[[CBS News]], [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/16/60minutes/main3516048_page2.shtml Omar Khadr: The Youngest Terrorist?]</ref>

From approximately February 2002, a team of American soldiers were using [[Khost Airfield|the abandoned Soviet airbase]] in [[Khost, Afghanistan]] as an intelligence-gathering outpost, as they tried to blend in and gain the trust of the local community.<ref name="thestar">Shephard, Michelle.

Six soldiers were sent to investigate the site of the phonecall.<ref name="thestar" />

The group was led by Major [[Randy Watts]]<ref>[[Mike Leavitt|Leavitt, Mike]]. "[[s2003 Utah State of the State Address|Utah State of the State Address]], January 21, 2003</ref>, and also included [[Executive Officer|XO]] Captain Mike Silver, Sgt [[Christopher Speer]] from [[Delta Force]], [[Layne Morris]] and Master Sgt. Scotty Hansen, both from the [[19th Special Forces Group (United States)|19th Special Forces Group]] and two others.<ref name="thestar" />

Arriving at a series of [[mud hut]]s and a [[granary]] filled with newly-harvested straw<ref name="child" /> surrounded by a 10-foot<ref name="fay" /> stone wall with a green metal gate<ref name="easy">Bravin, Jess.

Seeing five "well-dressed"<ref name="easy" /> men sitting around a fire in the main residence, with [[AK-47]]s visible in the room, Morris approached and told the occupants to open the front door. "They looked at me and I looked at them," he later remembered.<ref name="easy" /> When he was ignored, he retreated and the six Americans took up a position around the complex and waited 45 minutes while Morris called for support.<ref name="goodson" /> During this time, a crowd of approximately 100 local Afghans had gathered around the area to watch the incident unfold.<ref name="easy" /> An Afghan militiaman was sent towards the house to demand the surrender of the occupants, but retreated under gunfire.<ref name="OC1" />

After several reinforcements arrived, two more of Zadran's militiamen were sent into the compound to speak with the inhabitants. They returned to the Americans' position and reported that the men inside claimed to be [[Pashtun]] villagers. They were told to return to the huts, and inform the occupants that the Americans wanted to search their house regardless of their affiliation.<ref name="voa">Drudge, Michael. [[VOA News]], [[s:Ab Khail VOA Report|Afghanistan/Combat]], August 1 2002</ref> Upon hearing this, the occupants of the hut opened fire, shooting both militiamen.<ref>Note: The translators are varyingly described as "wounded" or "killed" by the opening fire</ref><ref name="worth">[[Andy Worthington|Worthington, Andy]].

Several women immediately fled the huts and ran away while the occupants began throwing grenades at the American troops, with intermittent rifle fire. After the firefight, a statement by one of the soldiers would contradict this and say that there had only been one woman and one child present, and both were detained by US forces after exiting the huts.<ref name="OC1" />

Morris and Silver had now taken up positions outside the stone wall, with Silver "over Morris's left shoulder explaining where he should try to position his next shot"<ref name="thestar" /> when Morris fell back into Silver, with a cut above his right eye and shrapnel embedded in his nose. "I thought his weapon had malfunctioned, that was my first thought," was Silver's recollection of the wound later attributed to an unseen grenade.<ref name="thestar" />

Morris was dragged a safe distance from the action, and was shortly after joined by Spc. Michael Rewakowski, Pfc. Brian Worth and Spc. Christopher J. Vedvick all of the 3rd Platoon of Company B of the 1st Battalion of the 505th.<ref name="fay">[[Fayetteville Observer]], [http://www.fayettevillenc.com/obj_stories/2002/aug/m01bragg.shtml story on firefight], August 3, 2002</ref> who had also been wounded by the grenade attacks.<ref name="purple">Schult, Ann Marie.

At 0910 a request for [[MedEvac]] was sent to the [[57th Medical Detachment]]. Ten minutes later, ''DUSTOFF 36'' and ''Wings 11'', a pair of [[UH-60]]s, were deployed as well as [[AH-64 Apache]]s ''Widowmaker 23'' and ''Widowmaker 26'' as escort. Arriving at the scene, the Apaches strafed the compound with cannon and rocket fire, while the medical helicopters remained 12 miles from the ongoing firefight.<ref name="dustoff" />  The helicopters finally landed at 1028 to load the wounded aboard ''DUSTOFF 36'', while Brian Basham switched helicopters to take a wounded prisoner aboard ''WINGS 11'', leaving Cpt. Michael Stone, CWO Ezekial Coffman, Spc. Jose Peru and Sgt. Frank Caudill aboard ''DUSTOFF 36''<ref>[http://www.sikorsky.com/details/0,9602,CLI1_DIV69_ETI1420,00.html 57th Med Wins DUSTOFF laurels.

At this point<ref name="OC1" />, a five-vehicle convoy of ground reinforcements arrived including a rifle squad from the [[82nd Airborne]].<ref name="OC1" /> Ten minutes later<ref name="OC1" />, the MedEvac left for [[Bagram Airbase]] and a pair of [[A-10 Warthog]]s arrived on-scene and began attacking the houses along with the Apaches. The MedEvac arrived at the hospital at 1130.<ref name="dustoff" />

Unaware that Khadr and an unidentified Mujahideen had survived the bombing, the ground forces agreed to send a team consisting of ''OC-1'', Silver, Speer and three Delta Force soldiers<ref>It is not immediately clear if ''OC-1'' was one of the Delta Force soldiers</ref> into a hole in the south side of the wall.

The team began picking their way over the carcasses of dead animals and three fighters.<ref name="thestar" />  According to Silver's 2007 telling of the story, he then heard a sound "like a gunshot", and saw the three Delta Force soldiers duck - as a grenade flew past them and exploded near Speer, who was at the rear of the group.<ref name="thestar" />  

''OC-1'' reported that although he didn't hear any gunfire, the dust being blown from an alley on the northside of the complex led him to believe the team was under fire from a shooter between the house and barn. He reported that a grenade was also "lobbed" over the wall that led to the alley and landed 30-50 metres from the alley opening. Running towards the alley to escape the grenade which he also didn't hear detonate, ''OC-1'' fired a dozen [[M4 Carbine]] rounds<ref>calculated from the fifteen rounds expended from his clip, and three  had been used in directed fire</ref> into the alley as he ran past, although he couldn't see anything due to the rising dust clouds.  Crouching at the southeast entrance to the alleyway, ''OC-1'' could see a man with a holstered pistol moving on the ground next to an [[AK-47]] who had been shot twice in the chest. From his position, ''OC-1'' fired a single shot into the man's head, killing him.<ref name="OC1" />

When the dust cleared, ''OC-1'' saw Khadr crouched on his knees facing away from the action and wounded by shrapnel that had just permanently blinded his left eye,<ref name="worth" /> and shot him twice in the back.<ref name="OC1" />

''OC-1'' estimated that all the events since entering the wall had taken less than a minute up until this point, and that he had been the only American to fire his weapon, although an American grenade had also been thrown into the living quarters after initially entering the complex.<ref name="OC1" />
[[Image:Khadr receiveing AA care.PNG|thumb|250px|Khadr being treated by medics.]][[Image:Omar Khadr getting battlefield first aid.jpg|thumb|250px|Two soldiers kneel over the wounded Khadr.]]
Silver initially claimed that ''two'' Delta Force troops had opened fire, shooting all three of the shots into Khadr's chest, after the youth was seen to be holding a pistol and facing the troops.<ref name="thestar" /><ref name="worth" /> These claims all directly contradict ''OC-1'''s version of events as the only eyewitness. ''OC-1'' did agree however, that something was lying in the dust near Khadr's end of the alley, although he couldn't remember if it were a pistol or grenade.<ref name="OC1" />
[[Image:Speer being Unloaded at Bagram.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Speer being unloaded at Bagram.]]
Entering the alleyway, ''OC-1'' saw two dead men with a damaged AK-47 buried in rubble who he believed had been killed in the airstrikes<ref name="OC1" />, and confirmed that the man he had shot was dead. Moving back to Khadr, ''OC-1'' tapped the motionless youth's eye, confirming that he was still alive. Turning him over onto his back, for entering troops to secure, he began exiting the alleyway to find Speer, who he was unaware had been wounded. While leaving the alleyway, he saw a third AK-47 and several grenades.<ref name="OC1" /> 
Contradicting Morris' report of five well-dressed men, ''OC-1'' maintained that a search of the rubble determined that there had only been four occupants, all found in the same alleyway.<ref name="OC1" />

Khadr was given on-site medical attention, during which time he repeatedly asked the medics to kill him in flawless English. An officer present later recorded in his diary that he was about to tell his [[Private_%28rank%29#United_States|Private Second Class]] to kill the wounded Khadr, when Delta Force soldiers ordered them not to harm the prisoner.<ref>[[Toronto Star]], [http://www.thestar.com/News/World/article/347974 Captured Khadr nearly executed: documents], March 19, 2008</ref>

He was then loaded aboard a [[CH-47 Chinook|CH-47 helicopter]] and flown to [[Bagram Airbase]], losing consciousness aboard the flight.<ref name="aff">[[s:Affidavit of Omar Ahmed Khadr|Affidavit of Omar Ahmed Khadr]], February 22, 2008</ref><ref name="OC1" />

The following day<ref name="OC1" />, soldiers including Silver later returned to search the premises. Local villagers were believed to have taken away two bodies and provided them an [[note also that it's not a "confused reference to Khadr" since the medEvac left the scene while their Apaches were still bombarding the compound, and Khadr was flown to Bagram on a CH-47, not a UH-60)|Islamic burial]], but refused to disclose their location to the Americans who wished to identify the fighters.<ref name="child" />
[[Image:Remains of Ab Kheyl Compound, July 2002.JPG|thumb|301px|Remains of the structure after bombing]]
Believing that the wooden boards beneath the last-killed rifleman could have been  used to cover an underground chamber<ref name="OC1" />, an [[excavator]] was used to tear down the walls of the buildings. This demolition uncovered several [[rocket-propelled grenades]] in the huts. Some of them had accidentally detonated while lying in the smouldering ruins.<ref name="child" /> A plastic bag was discovered in the [[granary]], containing documents, wires and a [[videocassette]].<ref name="child" /> ''OC-1'''s report claims the videotape was found in the main house, rather than the granary, and also mentioned [[detonator]]s modeled as [[Sega Mega Drive|Sega game cartridges]].<ref name="OC1" />

The video shows a youth, alleged to be Khadr, toying with [[detonating cord]] as other men including [[Abu Laith al-Libi]] assemble explosives in the same house as had just been destroyed, identifiable by its walls, rugs and the environment seen out the windows in the video.<ref name="thestar" /><ref name="OC1" /> and planting [[landmine]]s while smiling and joking with the cameraman.<ref name="easy" /><ref>[[CBS News]], [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/16/60minutes/main3516048.shtml Omar Khadr: The Youngest Terrorist?, Was Only 15 Years Old When He Was Captured In Afghanistan]</ref><ref name="child" /> It has been suggested that these were the same landmines later recovered by American forces on a road between Gardez and Khowst.<ref name="OC1" />

Speer was moved from Bagram airbase to [[Rammstein Air Base]] in Germany, where he died on August 7.

==Time at Bagram==
The unconscious Khadr was airlifted to receive medical attention at Bagram, where interrogations began immediately after he gained consciousness approximately a week after his arrival.<ref name="aff" /> He remained stretcher-bound for several weeks.<ref name="aff" /> Fellow detainee [[Rhuhel Ahmed]] later issued a statement alleging that Khadr had been denied forms of surgery to punish him for not cooperating with military forces<ref name="tipton">[http://ccrjustice.org/files/report_tiptonThree.pdf Composite statement: Detention in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay], Shafiq Rasul, Asif Iqbal and Rhuhel Ahmed</ref>

On [[30 August]] 2002, Canadian officials sent a diplomatic query to the United States requesting [[consulate|consular]] access to their citizen being held at Bagram. The request was denied ten days later, with a statement that Canada would be notified only if Canadian citizens were transferred to Guant√°namo Bay.<ref name="amnesty" />

Khadr states that he was refused pain medication for his wounds, that he had his hands tied above a door frame for hours, had cold water thrown on him, had a bag placed over his head and was threatened with military dogs, was [[fart|flatulated]] upon, forced to carry 5-gallon pails of water to aggravate his shoulder wound, .

Khadr spent three months recuperating at Bagram. During that time he was often singled out for extensive labour by American soldiers who "made him work like a horse", referring to him as "Buckshot" and calling him a murderer. They claimed that he had thrown a grenade at a passing convoy delivering medical supplies.<ref>[[Moazzam Begg|Begg, Moazzam]], ''Enemy Combatant''</ref> He shared a cell with [[Moazzam Begg]] and ten others. He became conversational with guard [[Damien Corsetti]], who was also one of his interrogators, and often spoke about [[basketball]].<ref name="child">[[Michelle Shephard]], "Guantanamo's Child", 2008.</ref>

He was transferred to Guantanamo along with a number of other captives on [[October 28]], 2002. [[Shackle]]d, fitted with [[surgical mask]]s, painted-over goggles and [[ear protectors]] to ensure [[sensory deprivation]], he recalled being kicked when he tried to stretch his legs.<ref name="child" /><ref name="aff" />

==Time at Guantanamo==
[[Image:James Yee.JPG|thumb|Muslim [[chaplain]] [[James Yee]].]]Khadr arrived at [[Guantanamo Bay]] on [[October 29]] or [[October 30]], to face charges of terrorism and war crimes for his actions. He was recorded as standing 70 centimetres and weighing 155lbs,<ref name="child" /> and was greeted to the camp  with the phrase "Welcome to Israel"<ref>O.K. v. Bush, 377 F. Supp. 2d 102; 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13758 at 3,</ref>

At first, he still spent much of his time in the prison hospital where he spoke with Muslim [[chaplain]] [[James Yee]], although he didn't seek any religious counselling.<ref name="child" /> By February 2003, he was writing to his grandparents in [[Scarborough, Ontario]], saying "I pray for you very much and don't forgat me from your pray'rs and don't forget to writ me and if ther any problem writ me".<ref name="letter">[[Michelle Shephard]], [[Toronto Star]], "Canadian faces murder charges at a military tribunal", January 8, 2006</ref>

[[Bryan Del Monte]], the [[Office of Detainee Affairs]] deputy director for political development and international issues, gave a [[press conference]] following his return from testifying before the [[United Nations Committee against torture]]. He asserted that Khadr, [[Muhammad Hamid Al Qarani|Muhammad al-Qarani]] and another youth were incarcerated separately from adults, and provided with daily lessons in mathematics, English, and science.<ref name=AsharqAlawsat060513>[http://aawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=3&id=4927 US DoD Official Discusses Guantanamo], ''[[Asharq Alawsat]]'', [[May 13]] [[2006]]</ref> Del Monte's assertion conflicts with all other assertions that Khadr was not among the youth who were held separately from the adult population - and that the three youths held in [[Camp Iguana#Used to hold child detainees|Camp Iguana]] had already been repatriated.
{{wikisource|Khadr case continues amid ‚Äúchild soldier‚Äù debate}}
Because he had turned 16 while at Bagram, he was now treated as an adult prisoner at Guantanamo.<ref name="child" /> Officials considered him an "intelligence treasure trove" not only because his father was [[Ahmed Said Khadr]], but because he had personally met [[Osama bin Laden]] and might be able to offer answers about the al-Qaeda hierarchy despite having been only ten years old at the time.<ref name="child" />
 
Yee, the Muslim chaplain, later recalled Khadr had been given an English [[Mickey Mouse]] book as a reward from an interrogator, and that he had greatly enjoyed it, sleeping with it clutched to his chest.<ref name="child" />

On [[January 21]] 2003, a new [[Standard Operating Procedure]] was put in place for American military interrogators who were told they would have to "radically create new methods and methodologies that are needed to complete this mission in defence of our nation".<ref name="child" />

In February 2003, Canadian Foreign Affairs intelligence officer [[Jim Gould]] and an official from the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] were allowed to interrogate Khadr themselves.<ref name="playDown" />  The presence of Gould, who brought Khadr a [[Big Mac]] value meal<ref name="letter" />, allowed the government to claim that the purpose of the visit was to "to ascertain Khadr's well-being", while his attorney [[Nate Whitling]] argued that "Foreign Affairs is suggesting that the visit was actually for (Khadr's) benefit, but this is not the case". His attorneys then sought a [[Federal Court of Canada|Federal Court]] [[injunction]] to prevent CSIS from interrogating their client in the future.<ref name="ctv01" /> The following month, a briefing from the Foreign Affairs department summarised Gould's findings stating that Khadr was a "thoroughly `screwed up' young man. All those persons who have been in positions of authority over him have abused him and his trust, for their own purposes."<ref name="child" />

The report from the Canadian interrogation<ref>[[November 14]] 2003 report</ref> states that:<ref name="playDown">[[Michelle Shephard|Shephard, Michelle]], [[Toronto Star]], [http://www.thestar.com/printArticle/247900 Ottawa played down Khadr concerns], August 20, 2007</ref>
{{quotation|"In a fit of anger, [Khadr] tore off his shirt revealing extensive scarring on the upper torso and a cluster of smaller ones on the upper left side of his body and on the back of his left shoulder."}}

Assistant Director of CSIS [[William Hooper (CSIS)|William Hooper]] assured the Canadian public this interrogation was not intended to secure intelligence for an American prosecution, but admitted that the information was all freely shared with his American captors - without securing any guarantees, such as foregoing potential [[death penalty]] charges.<ref name="ctv01">[[CTV News]], [http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20050409/Khadr_CSIS_050409?s_name=&no_ads= CSIS admits sharing Khadr info with U.S.: report], Apr. 9 2005</ref>

For most of 2003, Khadr had a cell next to British detainee [[Ruhal Ahmed]] and the two often discussed their favourite [[Hollywood]] films, including [[Braveheart]], [[Die Hard]] and [[Harry Potter]].<ref name="child" /> Ahmed later recalled that while some interrogations would see Khadr return to his cell smiling and discussing what movies he had been shown, other times he would return crying and huddle in the corner with his blanket over his head.<ref name="child" />

In the early spring of 2003, Khadr was told "Your life is in my hands" by a military interrogator, who spat on him, tore out some of his hair and threatened to send him to a country that would torture him more thoroughly, making specific reference to an Egyptian ''Askri raqm tisa'' ("Soldier Number Nine") who enjoyed raping prisoners. The interrogation ended with Khadr being told he would spend the rest of his life in Guantanamo.<ref name="unending" /> A few weeks later, an interrogator giving his name as Izmarai spoke to Khadr in Pashto, threatening to send him to a "new prison" at [[Bagram Airbase]] where "they like small boys".<ref name="unending" /> 

In all, Khadr has been reported to have been kept in solitary confinement for long periods of time; to have been denied adequate medical treatment; to have been subjected to [[short shackling]], and left bound, in uncomfortable [[stress positions]] until he soiled himself.<ref name=AmnestyInternationalCase14>

At the end of March 2003, Omar was upgraded to "Level Four" security, and transferred to [[solitary confinement]] in a windowless and empty cell for the month of April.<ref name="unending" />

Over the course of 2003, Khadr gained a "certain status" among the prisoners, and led prayer groups.<ref name="letter" /> At one point, a year after he confided in [[Moazzam Begg]] that his brother [[Abdurahman Khadr]] was working for the Americans<ref name="child" />, he was able to have a brief discussion with his brother who was also now being held at Guantanamo, and was just 50 feet away in a separate enclosure.

Canadian intelligence officer [[Jim Gould]] returned to Guantanamo in March 2004, but was met by an uncooperative Khadr. The Foreign Affairs office claimed that Khadr was trying to be a "tough guy" and impress his cellmates, while his attorney [[Muneer Ahmad]] said that Khadr had originally believed Gould "had finally come to help him" in 2003, but by 2004 had realised that he was being interrogated, not aided, by the Canadian government.<ref name="letter" />

In all, Khadr was interrogated by Canadians six times between 2003-2004<ref name="liar">[[Toronto Star]], "[http://www.thestar.com/article/347643 'Canadians called me a liar': Khadr]", March 19, 2008</ref>, and ordered to identify photos of Canadians believed to have ties to terrorism, including [[Maher Arar]] who was then handed over to Americans, flown to Syria and tortured for a year, before being found innocent.<ref name="liar" />.

He later recalled that he had  "tried to cooperate so that they would take me back to Canada".<ref name="liar" />

On [[June 18]] 2004, Khadr wrote a letter home to his mother who had moved back to Canada to seek medical attention for his younger brother Abdulkareem. Four months later he wrote another, as well as one to his brother [[Abdurahman Khadr]].

In August, attorneys [[Rick Wilson (attorney)|Rick Wilson]] and [[Muneer Ahmad]] submit an "emergency motion" asking for the release of Khadr's medical records. Rebuffed, they were instead granted a declaration from the Guantanamo naval hospital commander Dr. John S. Edmondson stating that Khadr was "in good health", and given a two-page document entitled
"Healthcare Services Evaluation"<ref name="repat" />

In November 2004, following a meeting with Ahmad and Wilson, Khadr was interrogated for four days about what he had discussed with his defence lawyers; during this time he alleges that interrogators used "extreme physical force" and refused to allow him to say his [[Salat|daily prayers]].<ref>Memorandum submitted by Muneer Ahmad and Richard Wilson for O.K. v.

During this visit, the lawyers had administered a psychological questionnaire known as the ""Folstein Mini mental status examination", which they later turned over to Dr. Eric W. Trupin, an expert in the developmental psychology of juveniles in confinement. Trupin ruled that Khadr was suffering from "delusions and hallucinations, suicidal behaviour and intense paranoia", and that his abuse had left him "particularly susceptible to mental
coercion."<ref name="repat" />, and at moderate to high risk of committing suicide.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Unending Torture of Omar Khadr|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=[[2006-08-24]]|author=Jeff Tietz}}</ref>

Rumsfeld]] that the [[Bush administration]] was wrong to declare they could legally withhold all the protections of the [[Geneva Conventions]] to captives from [[the war on terror]] - and that [[due process]] must be followed. Consequently, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] instituted "[[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]s". 

The Tribunals were not themselves authorized to determine whether the captives were ''lawful combatants'' -- simply to determine whether or not the captives have already been correctly proven to match the administration's definition of an "[[enemy combatant]]". Participation by the captives was voluntary, and Khadr chose not to be involved in his tribunal, at the urging of his lawyers who had been unallowed to meet with him.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}.

[[Image:Edney and Kuebler.jpg|thumb|[[Dennis Edney]] (l) and [[William C. Kuebler]] (r)]]On [[September 9]] 2007, charges were reinstated against Khadr after the [[Court of Military Commission Review]] overturned Brownback's dismissal, stating that the tribunal could determine the legality of a detainee's status for itself.

In March, Kuebler insisted that "Lt. Col. W.", the Army Commander for Eastern Afghanistan at the time of the attack, had initially written in his report the day after the firefight that "the person who threw a grenade that killed Sgt. 1st Class Christopher J. Speer also died in the firefight", implying that the grenade had indeed been thrown by the surviving Mujahideen, and not by Khadr. The report was rewritten months later to say that the grenade thrower had been "engaged", rather than "killed", changing the wording that exonerated Khadr.<ref name-"carol">{{cite news

===Canadian documentation===
[[Image:Supreme Court of Canada.jpg|thumb|135px|Supreme Court of Canada]]Khadr's defence attorneys claim that the Canadian government acted illegally, sending its counsel and CSIS agents to Guantanamo Bay to interrogate Khadr, and then turned their findings over to the Military Tribunal prosecutors to help convict Khadr.<ref>[[Michelle Shephard|Shephard, Michelle]], [[Toronto Star]], "[http://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/357020 Judges question Khadr secrecy]", March 27, 2008</ref>

In 2007, the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] ordered the Canadian government to turn over its records related to Khadr's time in captivity. The government appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in 2008, arguing that Khadr was just "fishing" for information and that disclosing their records could jeopardise national security.<ref name="scc">[[CTV]], [http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080326/khadr_SCC_080326/20080326?hub=CanadaAM SCC reserves decision on Omar Khadr case], March 26 2008</ref> 

Critics alleged that the refusal to release the classified documents is due to the "embarrassment to the government" they might cause, alleging it is the same tactic used to block the release of details about [[Maher Arar]], who was falsely accused of terrorism in 2002 and sent to [[Syria]] where he was tortured.<ref name="scc" />

===Civil lawsuit ===
[[Image:Judge Paul Cassells from Utah.png|thumb|125px|Judge Paul Cassell]]
Sgt. [[Layne Morris]], together with Sgt. Speer's widow Tabitha, launched a joint [[civil suit]] against the estate of [[Ahmed Said Khadr]] - claiming that the father's failure to control his son resulted in the loss of Speers' life and Morris' right eye. Since American law doesn't allow civil lawsuits against "acts of war", Speer and Morris relied on the argument that throwing the grenade was an act of terrorism, rather than war. Utah District Judge Paul Cassell gaving his ruling on [[February 17]] 2006, awarding $102.6 million in triple damages in what he said likely marks the first time terrorist acts have resulted in civil liabilities.<ref name=SLTribune> [http://www.sltrib.com/utah/ci_3522572 GI injured in Afghan war wins lawsuit: Unique case: Court awards default judgment to man blinded in one eye], ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'', [[February 16]] [[2006]]</ref> It has been suggested that the plaintiffs might collect funds via the [[U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act]].<ref name=SaltLakeTribune20070514>
