The '''United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America''' ([[UE]]) is an independent [[United States]] [[trade union|labor union]] representing workers in manufacturing as well as the public sector. UE  was one of the first unions to affiliate with the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] in [[1936]] and grew to more than 400,000 members in the [[1940s]]. UE was founded by several independent industrial unions which had been organized in the early and mid-[[1930s]] by workers in major plants of the [[General Electric Company]], [[Westinghouse Electric]], [[Radio Corporation of America|RCA]] and other leading electrical equipment and radio manufacturers.  In 1937 a group of local unions in the machine shop industry, led by James J. Matles, left the [[International Association of Machinists]], objecting to that union's policies of racial discimination, and joined the young UE. UE withdrew from affiliation with CIO in [[1949]] over differences related to the developing [[Cold War]]. It suffered significant losses of membership through the [[1950s]] as a result of a relentless campaign of persecution by employers, the federal government, and politicians of both major parties, and raids by the [[International Union of Electrical Workers]], which the CIO established as a rival under the leadership of James Carey, who had been voted out as president of UE in [[1941]], and by unions affiliated with the [[American Federation of Labor]]. Now representing 35,000 workers in a variety of industries, it continues actively organizing and has formed a strategic alliance with the [[Authentic Labor Front]], an independent [[Mexico|Mexican]] union. Today UE is regarded as one of the most democratic and politically progressive national unions in the United States. Its slogan is "The Members Run This Union!"



==Growth and schism==
The CIO granted UE a charter a few months after its founding and shortly after the AFL suspension of the CIO -- originally called the Committee on Industrial Organization and formed by existing industrial unions within the AFL as a caucus to promote the cause of organizing industrial unions in mass production industries. The AFL, dominated by craft unions, soon escalated the conflict by expelling the CIO unions, prominent among which were [[John L. Lewis]] of the [[United Mine Workers]] and [[Sidney Hillman]], president of the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]]. Over the next few years a dramatic wave of strikes and mass organizing by industrial workers rapidly built the membership of the CIO and of newly-formed industrial unions such as UE, the [[United Auto Workers]], United Rubber Workers, and [[United Steelworkers]].  The UE expanded greatly over the next decade, organizing workers of the major corporations in the electrical equipment, radio and machine tool industries. The union won a contentious strike at [[RCA]] and organized additional plants of GE, Westinghouse, GM's electrical division and smaller companies in its base industries. By the end of World War II, UE was the third largest CIO union, with a membership of 500,000.

Like many other new CIO unions organized in the 1930s, the membership and leaders of UE included a variety of radicals, including Socialists and Communists, as well as [[New Deal]] liberals and [[Catholics]]. Among the organizers and leaders of UE Local 107 at the Westinghouse South Philadelphia works were several former members of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. While foes of UE in the [[1940s]], [[1950s]] and [[1960s]] charged the union with "communist domination," recent scholarly studies have demonstrated that UE was and remains one of the most democratic U.S. labor unions, and that its policies differed markedly from those of the Communist Party on a number of major issues during those decades.

Following the outbreak of [[World War II]], UE joined with other unions in the CIO in urging a no-strike pledge and higher productivity for the duration of the war, which UE viewed as a struggle against world [[fascism]] and therefore worthy of labor's support. The UE also supported expanded use of piecework systems in industry, which it defended as both necessary to boost production and a way to improve workers' earnings under the wartime wage control systems imposed by the War Labor Board. This appears, in fact, to be largely true: the incentive systems that management used were their loosest during World War II and represented an important, and generally popular, form of compensation for workers. UE continued to bargain aggressively for its members during the war, winning numerous improvements in contract language and benefits. Despite the [[War Labor Board]]'s policy of freezing wages for the duration of the war, UE leaders devised creative strategies to win WLB approval of pay increases for many of their members. And despite the union's support for the no-strike pledge, UE leaders supported militant actions by their members, such as a atrike by UE members at a [[Babcock and Wilcox]] plant in [[New Jersey]].

Soon after the war ended, beginning in late [[1945]], the three largest unions of the CIO engaged in a national strike to regain economic ground lost by workers during the war, when wages had been frozen but industrial profits had risen significantly. The United Auto Workers shut down the auto plants of General Motors; UE struck GE, Westinghouse, and the GM electrical division, and the United Steelworkers stopped work in the basic steel industry. The [[1946]] strikes were successful, but the outcome stiffened the resolve of industrialists to break the power of the CIO through a strategy of divide-and-conquer. The brewing Cold War with the [[Soviet Union]] would provide the opportunity, and in October 1946 GE's Charles Wilson summarized the political program of big business when he declared that the problems of the United States could be summed up as "Russia abroad, labor at home."

[[United States Republican Party|Republican]] victories in the elections of [[1946]] had brought a much more conservative Congress to Washington, with the determination to curb labor. The [[Taft-Hartley Act]], drafted in large part by lobbyists for the [[National Association of Manufacturers]], General Electric, [[Inland Steel]] and other industrialists, represented a major revision of the [[Wagner Act]] that significantly weakened labor's ability to organize and effectively negotiate. Among its many anti-union provisions was a clause requiring officers of all union to sign "non-communist affidavits," swearing that they were not members of the Communist Party. Leaders of virtually all CIO and AFL unions denounced this new law, and in particular called the non-communist affidavit clause an intolerable government interference in internal union matters and an encroachment on freedom of speech and association. Union leaders vowed to boycott the Taft-Hartley labor board and agreed in principle that all would refuse to sign the affidavits. But few lived up to that pledge. Some union leaders, including [[Walter Reuther]] of the UAW, signed the Taft-Hartley affidavits and then proceeded to raid (attempt to replace) locals of UE and the Farm Equipment Workers (FE), whose leaders were still holding out and refusing to sign. This meant that the raiding union, UAW, would appear on the NLRB ballot, but the incumbent union, UE or FE, could not.

The CIO, under President [[Philip Murray]], did nothing to discourage the [[United Auto Workers]] from poaching on UE shops in the arms and typewriter industries in the Connecticut River Valley; other unions affiliated with the AFL, such as the [[International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers]], likewise displaced the UE in some plants.

Fissures within UE that appeared around the 1941 convention, when James Carey had been voted out as president, reopened in the late-40's national political environment of anti-communist hysteria. Up-and-coming Republican politicians, such as Congressman [[Richard Nixon]] of [[California]] and Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] of [[Wisconsin]], made their careers by conducting witch-hunts for imagined "Communist subversion" within the federal government, and by red-baiting their election opponents. The CIO itself was a prime target of the Republican red-baiters. CIO leaders such as Philip Murray of the [[Steelworkers]] and [[Walter Reuther]] of the [[UAW]] responded to these attacks by purging their own unions of radicals, and by attacking those CIO unions, such as UE, that held out against the red-baiting tide. Investigations by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] and criticism from groups such as the [[Association of Catholic Trade Unionists]], which actively organized dissenters within UE into an opposition faction, put UE leaders on the defensive.

Anti-communist raids by other unions removed some conservative members and locals from UE, thereby weakening the right-wing internal opposition. Nonetheless oppositionists were confident that the national political atmosphere would enable them to seize power in UE at the union's [[1949]] convention. But the right-wing candidates were soundly defeated. UE's convention delegates instead backed their national officers' demands that the CIO stop the UAW and other CIO unions from raiding UE. To defend the union from future raids, UE reversed its refusal to sign Taft-Hartley affidavits, enabling the union to again appear on the ballot in NLRB representation elections. When the CIO refused to take action to stop CIO-affiliated unions from raiding other CIO unions, UE boycotted the CIO's national convention in [[1949]] and withheld its per capita dues payments, effectively resigning its affiliation to the CIO. The CIO responded by announcing the expulsion of UE as well as that of the United Farm Equipment Workers (FE); the following year the CIO expelled nine other progressive unions. Of the 11 "left" unions that were expelled from or resigned the CIO in 1949-50, only UE and the [[International Longshore and Warehouse Union]] remain in existence today; the others were broken by the relentless attacks of employers, the government and other unions through the period of [[McCarthyism]].

In the case of UE, the CIO went a step further, chartering a rival union, the International Union of Electrical Workers, that would attempt to destroy and replace UE. The IUE wrested away many of the locals in the radio assembly and light manufacturing industries; the UE held on to much of its base in machine building. In the heavy electrical equipment plants, on the other hand, the two factions each had substantial strength. The resulting battles were fierce: in Local 601, which represented Westinghouse workers in [[East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] and whose members had a tradition of radical politics dating back to [[Eugene V. Debs]]' candidacy for President in [[1912]], the two factions were led by brothers Mike and Tom Fitzgerald, who attacked each other personally as vigorously as the factions did on political issues. The IUE won a close election, with the semi-skilled workers supporting the IUE while more skilled workers favored the UE.

Employers, the federal government, the news media and other establishment forces played major roles in the efforts to eliminate UE. UE was subjected to an endless barrage of inquisitions by Congressional committees, such as the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], Sen. [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s Subcommittee on Investigations, and a similar committee chaired by Sen. [[John Marshall Butler]]. In several instances, these committees used subpoena power to set up UE members for firing by their employers unless the subpoenaed worker cooperated by  "naming names" and thereby subjecting other workers to the inquisition. GE fired John Nelson, president of UE's large [http://www.uelocal506.org/ Local 506] in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], on just such grounds. The stress resulting from his own firing and the unrelenting persecution of his union destroyed Nelson's health; he died in 1959 at the age of 42. McCarthy's "investigations" were sometimes carefully scheduled to help the IUE and the companies against UE. In 1953 he held a hearing in [[Lynn, Massachusetts]] on the eve of an NLRB election between UE and IUE at the major GE plant there. His grilling of UE members, in the guise of investigating "Communist subversion," made for sensationalist news headlines and helped the IUE eke out a narrow win. 

Several UE shop leaders, as well as UE Secretary-Treasurer Julius Emspak, were put on trial on contempt charges for refusing to cooperate with HUAC. The federal government tried unsuccessfully to take away James Matles's citizenship and deport him; the UE national organizing director had immigrated from [[Romania]] as a youth. Other similar prosecutions, harassment by the FBI, vicious attacks in local newspapers, and denunciation by politicians, kept UE under siege for years.

The red-baiting attacks on UE during the McCarthy era did tremendous damage to the union, but were eventually shown, even in the prevailing atmosphere of anti-red hysteria, to have no legal merit. Most of the legal cases against UE leaders were eventually withdrawn or defeated in the courts, and in March 1959 the [[U.S. Justice Department]] was forced to drop its prosecution of UE on charges that the union was "Communist-dominated." 

It seems a miracle that UE survived the 1950s at all, with attacks coming at it from all directions: the federal administration, Congress, Republicans and Democrats, news media, "mainstream" unions of both CIO and AFL, and even some members of the clergy. What helped UE to weather these storms was its own democratic structure and manner of operation, and its superior record of representing members (when contrasted with the IUE, for example) in collective bargaining and in fighting for shop grievances. Both of these attributes engendered fierce loyalty to UE among many of its members, even as the union was being slandered by powerful forces as some sort of national security threat. UE loyalists counteracted the IUE by highlighting its relative weakness in standing up to management, and derisively characterized the acronym IUE as standing for "Imitation UE."

While the UE and the IUE won roughly equal number of elections through the first half of the 1950s, the IUE came away with larger numbers of members, particularly in the growing field of consumer electronics. Other unions, including the IBEW, the IAM, the UAW, the [[United Steel Workers of America]], the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] and the [[Sheet Metal Workers International Association]], also wedged in during these elections. The IUE, moreover, found itself divided, as the divergent groups that had allied to oppose the UE now found it hard to work with each other once in power. James Carey's arrogance eventually caught up with him within the IUE as it has in UE. In 1966 he was defeated for the presidency of IUE by one of his own lieutenants, leaving him with the dubious distinction of being the only person in U.S. labor history to be elected, and subsequently thrown out, as national president of two different unions.

During World War II and continuing through the Cold War, UE took a more progressive position on women's rights than other unions, advocating "equal pay for equal work" during the war and, after the war, resisting employers' attempts to drive married women out of industry and to deny seniority and maternity leave to women workers. The 1946 strike at GE was prolonged by the company's insistence on giving a smaller wage increase to its women employees, whom GE president [[Charles E. Wilson]] contemptuously dismissed as "bobbysoxers." With all other strike issues resolved, UE held out on the picket lines until GE agreed that women would receive the same raises as men. In the early 1950s, while the union was under attack from all directions, UE organized a series of district and national conferences on the problems of women workers. Local union leaders who opposed UE's policies on gender equality often bolted to the IUE, and took members with them.

UE also stood out in that period for its advocacy of equality for African American workers. In July 1950 UE leaders appointed Ernest Thompson, a black international representative and former rank-and-file factory worker, as secretary of the UE Fair Practices Committee. In essence the union's affirmative action officer, Thompson met with the leadership of UE locals around the country to develop and implement action plans to force employers to hire more black workers, and to give African Americans opportunities to advance into skilled trades jobs. In the midst of the Cold War assaults on UE, the union's newspaper reported such success stories as the promotion of a black worker at Johnson Machine to lathe operator. The company had insisted that this worker was unqualified and refused to train him, so white union members had taught him the job during their lunch breaks. Here again, UE's progressive position was used against it by its foes; in several instances the IUE openly appealed for the votes of white workers on the basis of racial bigotry and by attacking UE's support for racial equality.

By 1954, UE officers reported that 87 percent of all UE contracts contained no-discrimination clauses, an achievement that placed UE far ahead of other unions.

A second wave of defections in the mid-1950s took several important UE locals, which had survived earlier raiding, into the IUE and other unions. The UE's membership dropped from 200,000 in [[1953]] to 58,000 in [[1960]]. Some of the losses resulted from companies, including GE and Westinghouse, moving portions of their manufacturing from older plants in the [[U.S. Northeast|Northeast]] to new plants in the [[U.S. Southern states|South]] and [[U.S. West|West]].

==Reshaping itself==
The UE and IUE began cooperate in bargaining after the IUE's disastrous 1960 strike against GE. In the successful 103-day national strike in 1969-70, UE and IUE led an alliance of unions which broke the back of Boulwarism, GE’s aggressive 20-year-long policy of “take-it-or-leave-it” bargaining. Boulwarism was named for Lemuel Boulware, the company’s vice president of labor and community relations, who devised the strategy in reaction to UE's success in the 1946 strike, and to capitalize on the bitter divisions, after 1949, in the ranks of GE union members. The [[1970s]] brought UE renewed growth through successful organizing. UE lost many members in the [[1980s]] and [[1990s]], as the flight of many manufacturing plants abroad led to plant closings by both major employers in the electrical manufacturing industry, as well as by smaller UE employers.
 
Despite shrinkage of GE's U.S. manufacturing employment, UE remains a major force within General Electric today and plays a leading role in negotiating contracts that cover members of 13 unions in GE through the [http://geworkersunited.org/ Coordinated Bargaining Committee]. UE’s role in the union coalition resulted in union gains in [http://www.ueunion.org/unity2007.html 2007 national negotiations]with GE. 

The UE has  broadened its scope in recent years, organizing public employees, service industry workers, school and college employees, and others. The UE has also replaced some other unions in workplaces where the existing unions has failed to adequately represent the membership.

The UE has entered into a [http://www.ueinternational.org/ Strategic Organizing Alliance] with the ''Frente Auténtico del Trabajo'' (FAT), Mexico's Authentic Labor Front, in which the UE and FAT collaborate in organizing and educational projects. UE's organizing alliance with the FAT started in 1992 and grew from the two organizations' shared opposition to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]].The UE has also formed alliances with non-labor groups, both in the U.S. and internationally, through the [[World Social Forum]], to fight the effects of [[globalization]] promoted by institutions of global capital such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] and free trade agreements modeled on [[NAFTA]].

Beginning in the mid-1990s, UE has been organizing state and municipal workers in [[North Carolina]], chartering their statewide organization as [http://www.ue150.org/ UE Local 150]. A North Carolina state law dating to the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] era of racial segregation, General Statute 95-98, prohibits public employees from bargaining labor contracts. UE is campaigning to repeal that act and replace it with legislation to facilitate public sector bargaining. As part of that campaign, UE in December 2005 brought a complaint before the [[International Labor Organization]], the UN’s labor agency, charging that the North Carolina bargaining ban violates international agreements on labor rights, which uphold the right of nearly all workers to form unions and bargain collectively. In March 2007 the ILO ruled in favor of UE, and called upon the United States and North Carolina to repeal GS 95-98 and begin discussions with unions to establish “a framework for collective bargaining.” UE’s Mexican ally the FAT, with the support of 52 other U.S., Mexican, Canadian and global labor organizations, filed a complaint in October 2006 with the Mexican National Administrative Office – a body established to address complaints of labor rights violations under [[NAFTA]]. The complaint charges that the North Carolina bargaining ban violates the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC), the labor-rights side agreement to NAFTA. In November 2007 the Mexican NAO launched an investigation into those charges.

UE has expanded its public sector organizing to two other states in the [[Upper South]] that also lack public employee bargaining rights, establishing [http://www.vaue160.org/union/modules/news/ UE Local 160] in [[Virginia]] and [http://www.uelocal170.org/ UE Local 170] in [[West Virginia]]. 

UE has also become known as the "National Home for Independent Unions", and works with independent unions across the country. Over the past 20 years several smaller independent unions have affiliated with UE. The most recent such victory for UE came in July 2005 when the 2,300 member Connecticut Independent Labor and Police Unions (CILU/CIPU) voted by an overwhelming 936 to 121 to become [http://www.cilu.org UE Local 222].
