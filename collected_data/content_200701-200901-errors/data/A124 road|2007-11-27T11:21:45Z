The '''A124 road''' is a road in [[East London, England|East London]] linking [[Canning Town]] with [[Upminster]].

The road begins at a junction with the [[A13 road]] at [[Canning Town station]] in the south west of the [[London Borough of Newham]]. The road continues in a north easterly direction for 3 miles (4.9 km) as ''Barking Road'', passing through [[West Ham]], [[Plaistow, Newham|Plaistow]] and [[East Ham]].

The road passes into the [[London Borough of Barking and Dagenham]] at a crossing of the [[River Roding]] and there forms a junction with the [[A406 road|North Circular Road]]. The road bypasses [[Barking]] town centre as the ''Northern Relief Road'' and is then called ''Longbridge Road'' for 2 miles (3.2 km), forming a short section of [[dual carriageway]] and part of the borough boundary with the [[London Borough of Redbridge]].

The road becomes ''Wood Lane'' at [[Becontree]] and continues north easterly for 1.9 miles (3.1 km) as far as [[Becontree Heath]] where it passes into the [[London Borough of Havering]] and becomes ''Rush Green Road'' from there to [[Roneo Corner]], a distance of 1.2 miles (2 km). The road then becomes ''Hornchurch Road'' and passes through [[Hornchurch]] where it forms the ''High Street''. After Hornchurch the road becomes ''Upminster Road'' and continues past [[Upminster Bridge tube station]], becoming ''St Mary's Lane'' at the [[River Ingrebourne]] and ends at ''Bell Corner'' in [[Upminster]].

The road is served by [[London Buses route 5]] from Canning Town to Roneo Corner and by [[London Buses route 248]] from there to Upminster; with other routes also serving various sections.

==History==
The A124 ''Barking Road'' formed part of the original [[A13 road|A13]] route between Canning Town and Barking, prior to the ''East Ham & Barking Bypass'' opening in 1928, although the latter was briefly designated A118. The original eastern terminus of the A124 was Roneo Corner.
