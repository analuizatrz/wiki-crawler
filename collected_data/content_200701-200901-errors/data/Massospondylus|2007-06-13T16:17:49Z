'''''Massospondylus''''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] 'elongated vertebra'), formerly known as '''''Aristosaurus''''', was an Early [[Jurassic]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] [[prosauropod]], although, if ''[[Aetonyx]]'' is the same as ''Massospondylus'', it lived from the Late [[Triassic]] as well. It was probably a plant eater ([[herbivore]]), although it is speculated that the [[prosauropod]]s may have been [[Omnivore|omnivorous]]. This [[dinosaur]] was named by Sir [[Richard Owen]] in [[1854]], from remains found in [[South Africa]]. It is thus one of the first dinosaurs to be named. 

Fossils have since been found in [[Arizona]]'s [[Kayenta Formation]], [[South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. 

==Paleobiology==
[[Image:Massospondylus.jpg|350px|thumb|left]]
''Massospondylus'' was fairly large for a [[prosauropod]] at 6.1 meters (20 feet) long, about 5 feet tall and had an 8-foot long tail. Although long assumed to have been [[quadraped|quadrupedal]], a recent anatomical study of the forelimbs has questioned this, arguing that their range and motion precludes effective habitual quadrupedal gait.<ref name ="Bon07">Bonnan M, Senter P. (2007). Were the basal sauropodomorph dinosaurs ''Plateosaurus'' and ''Massospondylus'' habitual quadrupeds?; pp. 139-155 in Barrett, P.M. and Batten, D.J. (eds.), ''Evolution and Palaeobiology of Early Sauropodomorph Dinosaurs''. ''Special Papers in Palaeontology'' '''77'''. </ref> 

The animal was a typical [[prosauropod]] in most other respects. It possessed a large body and long neck, a small head and almost circular eye sockets. Teeth in the lower jaw were not as long as those in the upper jaw. There also seems to be some variation of tooth morphology, based upon the tooth's position in the jaw, although this is not as pronounced as the specialization of teeth in ''[[Heterodontosaurus]]''. Teeth occupying a position closer to the front of the snout were rounder than the more oval-shaped back teeth. Interestingly, the skull of the Arizona specimen is 25% larger than the largest skull from any African specimen. [[Gastrolith]]s have been found in ''Massospondylus'' fossils.

===Reproduction===
In the [[1970s]], six 190-million year old ''Massospondylus'' eggs were found, in [[Golden Gate Highlands National Park]] in [[South Africa]] by [[James Kitching]], who identified them as belonging most likely to ''Massospondylus''. It took nearly 30 years before extraction was started on the fossils of the 6 inch embryos. They remain the oldest dinosaur embryos ever found. Notably, the near-hatchlings had no teeth, suggesting they had no way of feeding themselves. Scientists speculate that after-birth care might have been necessary. The four legs of the near-hatchlings were of equal length. The tail was short and the head over-sized. This suggests a different pattern of development for dinosaurs from that which had previously been thought.
