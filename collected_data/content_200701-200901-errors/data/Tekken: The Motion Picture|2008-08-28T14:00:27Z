'''''Tekken''''' is a 1998 two-part [[OVA]] series, based on [[Namco]]'s  [[video game franchise]] ''[[Tekken (series)|Tekken]]''. The story is an amalgamation of the first two games in the series, focusing on the first [[Tekken|King of Iron Fist Tournament]] while giving a prominent role to [[Jun Kazama]], who was introduced in ''[[Tekken 2]]''. The two OVA episodes were edited into one and released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] in [[North America]] by [[ADV Films]] and has occasionally been aired on [[cable television]] in the U.S.

==Plot outline==

The film starts with a flashback featuring [[Kazuya Mishima]], a child studying martial arts under his father. He meets a young girl named [[Jun Kazama]], who is crying after seeing a [[bobcat]] kill a defenseless [[rabbit]]. When Kazuya offers to kill the bobcat, Kazuya's father, [[Heihachi Mishima]], appears and drags Kazuya away. To make his son prove his strength, Heihachi throws Kazuya into a deep ravine, but not before ripping a locket containing a picture of Kazuya's mother from his son's neck and tossing it aside. Kazuya screams as he falls into the chasm. Jun, who tried and failed to locate Kazuya, finds the locket and keeps it with her into adulthood.

On the day of the tournament, Kazuya and Jun fight their way through the other competitors on the island. Kazuya intends to fight his way to the center and kill his father in revenge, while Jun races to stop him. After catching up to him, Jun begins to make another appeal when they're attacked by monsters released by Lee, but they fight them off. Kazuya then continues on his way and quickly beats Lee in direct combat before squaring off against Heihachi.

The fighting is brutal, but Kazuya, who had formed a pact with the Devil to survive his fall into the ravine as a child, uses his demonic power to defeat his father. Before he can finish him off, however, Jun steps in one last time, and convinces Kazuya that he's about to do the wrong thing. Kazuya is able to calm his spirit, and he takes mercy on his father. In the meantime, Lee, convinced that the Mishima Zaibatsu should be destroyed if he isn't allowed to inherit it, activates a self-destruct mechanism on the island. Kazuya, Jun and most of the other competitors are able to escape by ship, while Heihachi himself flees the island by air. The tournament ends, and the island explodes.

In a brief epilogue, Jun is by herself  sewing something among some trees with some animals when her young son, [[Jin Kazama]], who bears a strong resemblance to Kazuya, runs up to her, telling that he wants to hear the rest of the story she was telling him the previous day. Jun senses that the winds are changing (possibly the forshadowing of their encouter with Ogre). Jin asks what's wrong, but Jun assures him that everything will be fine, and they walk off together.

The other major subplot, which runs concurrently with the rest of the film, features [[Lei Wulong]] working as Jun's partner, who investigates the weapons lab located below the surface of the island with the help of the combat android [[Jack (Tekken) #Jack-2|Jack-2]], who wants to cure a little girl of her illness. A few other fighters from the games, most notably [[Bruce Irvin]], [[Baek Doo San]], [[Michelle Chang]], [[Anna Williams (Tekken)|Anna Williams]], [[Nina Williams]], [[Jack (Tekken) #Prototype Jack|Prototype Jack]], [[Roger (Tekken)|Roger]], and [[Ganryu (Tekken)|Ganryu]] play small parts in the story. Most of the other game characters like [[King (Tekken)|King]], [[Armor King]], [[Yoshimitsu (Namco)|Yoshimitsu]], [[Marshall Law (Tekken)|Marshall Law]], and [[Paul Phoenix (Tekken)|Paul Phoenix]] appear in background cameos with no direct influence on the story.

==Reaction==
''Tekken: The Motion Picture'' has been variously hailed and panned by fans and critics alike. The root of the movie's popularity stems from the action and the fighting, which fans consider to be outstandingly realistic. But the designs and English voices for some of the characters have led others to dislike the film, especially for Kazuya's incredibly deep voice and striking resemblance to ''[[Dragon Ball Z|Dragon Ball Z's]]'' [[Vegeta]]. Also noteworthy is the incorrect pronunciation of Heihachi's name ("Haihachee").
