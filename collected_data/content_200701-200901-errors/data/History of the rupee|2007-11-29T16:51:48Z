[[Image:Rupee1917.jpg|thumb|250px|right|British Indian 1 rupee, 1917]]

[[India]] has been one of the earliest issuers of coins in the world (circa 6th Century BC). The origin of the word "rupee" is found in the word ''rūp'' or ''rūpā'', which means "silver" in many [[Indo-Aryan languages]] such as [[Hindi]].  The [[Sanskrit]] word ''rupyakam ([[Devanagari]]:रूप्यकम्) '' means coin of silver. The derivative word ''Rūpaya'' was used to denote the coin introduced by [[Sher Shah Suri]] during his reign from 1540 to 1545 CE.  The original Rūpaya was a silver coin weighing 175 [[Grain (measure)|grains]] troy (about 11.34 grams) <sup>[http://lakdiva.org/coins/silver_rupee.html]</sup>.  The coin has been used since then, even during the times of [[British India]].  Formerly the rupee was divided into 16 [[anna]]s, 64 paise, or 192 [[pie (Indian coin)|pie]]s.  In [[Arabia]] and [[East Africa]] the British India rupee was current at various times, including the paisa and was used as far south as [[Natal]]. In [[Mozambique]] the British India rupees were overstamped, and in [[Kenya]] the British East Africa company minted the rupee and its fractions as well as pice. It was maintained as the florin, using the same standard, until 1920. In [[Somalia]] the Italian colonial authority minted 'Rupia' to the exact same standard, and called the paisa 'besa'. Early 19th century E.I.C. rupees were used in [[Australia]] for a limited period.  [[Decimalisation]] occurred in [[Ceylon]] ([[Sri Lanka]]) in [[1872]], India in [[1957]] and in [[Pakistan]] in [[1961]].

Among the earliest issues of [[Banknote|paper rupees]] were those by the ''Bank of Hindostan'' (1770-1832), the ''General Bank of Bengal and Bihar'' (1773-75, established by [[Warren Hastings]]), the ''Bengal Bank'' (1784-91), amongst others.

Historically, the rupee was a silver based currency. This had severe consequences in the [[nineteenth century]], when the strongest economies in the world were on the [[gold standard]]. The discovery of vast quantities of silver in the [[U.S.]] and various European colonies resulted in a decline in the relative value of silver to gold. Suddenly the standard currency of India could not buy as much from the outside world. This event was known as "the fall of the Rupee." 

During British rule, and the first decade of independence, the rupee was subdivided into 16 [[Indian anna|Anna]]s. Each Anna was subdivided into either 4 [[paise|pices]], or 12 [[pie (Indian coin)|pie]]s. 

In [[1957]], [[decimalisation]] occurred and the rupee was now divided into 100 Naye Paise (Hindi for ''new paisas''). After a few years, the initial "Naye" was dropped. However many still refer to 25, 50 & 75 paise as 4, 8 and 12 annas respectively, not unlike the now largely defunct usage of "[[Bit (money)|bit]]" in American English for 1/8 dollar.

Note: a parallel development to the above etymological origins of the word "rupee" can be discerned in [[Hebrew]], where the [[Biblical]] word "kesef" (כסף) eventually came to mean both "silver" and "money".

==Rupee banknotes==
===Early paper issues===
Notes issued by the [[Bank of Bengal]] can be categorised in the following three series. 

* '''Unifaced series''': The early notes of the Bank of Bengal were printed only on one side and were issued as one ''gold mohur'' and in denominations of Rs. 100, Rs. 250, Rs. 500, etc.
* '''Commerce series''': Later notes had a vignette representing an allegorical female figure personifying 'commerce'. The notes were printed on both sides. On the obverse the name of the bank and the denominations were printed in three scripts, viz., [[Urdu]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Devanagari]]. On the reverse of such notes was printed a cartouche with ornamentation carrying the name of the Bank. 
* '''Brittania series''': By late 1800s, the motif 'commerce' was replaced by 'Britannia'. The new banknotes had more features to prevent forgery.

===British India issues===
The [[Paper Currency Act of 1861]] gave the Government the monopoly of note issue throughout the vast expanse of India, which was a considerable task. Eventually, the management of paper currency was entrusted to the Mint Masters, the Accountant Generals and the Controller of Currency.

* '''Victoria portrait series''': The first set of British India notes were the '[[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] Portrait' series issued in denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100 and 1000. These were unifaced, carried two language panels. The security features incorporated the watermark, the printed signature and the registration of the notes.
* '''Underprint series''': The unifaced Underprint series was introduced in 1867 as the Victoria Portrait series was withdrawn in the wake of a spate of forgeries.
* '''George V series''': A series carrying the portrait of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] were introduced in 1923, and was continued as an integral feature of all paper money issues of British India. These notes were issued in denominations of Rs 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 10,000.

===Reserve Bank issues during British India===
The Reserve Bank of India was formally inaugurated on Monday, [[April 1]], [[1935]] with its Central Office at Calcutta. Section 22 of the RBI Act, 1934, empowered it to continue issuing Government of India notes until its own notes were ready for issue. The bank issued the first five rupee note bearing the portrait of [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] in [[1938]]. This was followed by Rs. 10 in February, Rs 100 in March and Rs 1,000 and Rs 10,000 in June [[1938]]. The first Reserve Bank issues were signed by the second Governor, [[Sir James Taylor]]. In August [[1940]], the one-rupee note was reintroduced as a wartime measure, as a Government note with the status of a rupee coin. During the war, the [[Japan]]ese produced high-quality forgeries of the Indian currency. This necessitated a change in the watermark. The profile portrait of George VI was changed to his full frontal portrait. The security thread was introduced for the first time in India. The George VI series continued till [[1947]] and thereafter as a frozen series till [[1950]] when post-independence notes were issued.

===Republic of India Issues===
After [[Independence of India]], the government brought out the new design Re. 1 note in [[1949]]. Initially it was felt that the King's portrait be replaced by a portrait of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Finally however, the [[Lion Capital of Asoka]] was chosen. The new design of notes were largely along earlier lines. In [[1953]], [[Hindi]] was displayed prominently on the new notes. The economic crisis in late 1960s led to a reduction in the size of notes in 1967. High denomination notes, like Rs. 10,000 notes were demonetised in 1978. 

The "Mahatma Gandhi Series" was introduced in 1996. Prominent new features included a changed watermark, windowed security thread, latent image and intaglio features for the visually handicapped.

===Other issues===
{{main|French Indian rupee|Portuguese Indian Rupia|Gulf rupee}}

* '''Jammu and Kashmir issues''': Maharaja [[Rambir Singh]] introduced paper money on watermarked paper in 1877. The notes were not very popular and were in circulation for a very short period. The notes carried the 'Sun' motif of the [[Dogra]] family.
* '''Hyderabad issues''': The Government of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] had made several efforts to organise private bankers to set up a banking company which could issued paper money. The British, however resisted the attempts of Indian [[princely state]]s to issue paper currency. The acute shortage of silver during the [[First World War]] and the contributions of [[Hyderabad State]] to the British war effort led them to accept, in [[1918]], paper currency in denominations of Rs.10/- and Rs.100/- issued under the Hyderabad Currency Act. The currency was designated the ''Osmania Sicca'' (OS). Rupee One and Rupees Five notes were issued subsequently in 1919 and Rupees One Thousand notes were issued in 1926. After the setting up of the India Currency Notes Press at [[Nasik]], Hyderabad notes came to be printed there.
* '''Burma issues''': Burma separated from India in [[1938]]; however, the Reserve Bank of India acted as Banker to the Government of [[Burma]] and was responsible for note issue in terms of the Burma Monetary Arrangements Order, [[1937]]. In May 1938 the Bank issued Burma notes which were not legal tender in India.
* '''Indo-French issues''': The French Indian rupee (FIR) was introduced by [[France]]'s  Bank of [[Indochina]] in [[French India|French colonies]] of [[India]].
* '''Indo-Portuguese issues ''': The Portuguese Indian Rupia was the currency of [[Portuguese India]] until 1959. It was divisible into 16 [[Tanga (currency)|Tangas]] or 960 [[Reis]]. In 1959, the currency was changed to the [[Portuguese Indian Escudo]], at the rate of 1 Rupia for 6 Escudos.
* '''Persian Gulf issues''': For many years in the early and mid 20th century, the Indian rupee was the official currency in several areas that were controlled by the British and governed from India; areas such as [[East Africa]], Southern [[Arabia]] and the [[Persian Gulf]]. The rupees used in the Persian Gulf had been bought by the Gulf states from the [[Reserve Bank of India]], who held the sterling reserves by which the rupees had originally been purchased. However, Indian rupees were being smuggled from India to the states of the Persian Gulf in exchange for gold. It was estimated in 1959 that the total amount of gold in private hands in India was about $US1.75 to 2 billion--roughly two thirds of the value of paper money in circulation. While it was legal to own and to trade in gold within India, it was illegal to import or export gold. The Gulf Rupee, also known as the Persian Gulf Rupee (XPGR), was introduced by the [[India]]n government as a replacement for the [[Indian Rupee]] for circulation exclusively outside the country with the Reserve Bank of India Amendment Act, [[1 May]] [[1959]]. After India devalued the rupee on [[6 June]] [[1966]], those countries still using it - [[Oman]], [[Qatar]] and what is now the [[United Arab Emirates]] (known as the Trucial States until [[1971]]) - replaced the Gulf Rupee with their own currencies.  [[Kuwait]] and [[Bahrain]] had already done so in [[1961]] and [[1965]] respectively.
* '''Emergency issues,  Princely states''': During the 1940s, when mints were occupied for use in the war, an acute scarcity of small coins was felt throughout India. Princely states in Western India like [[Balvan]], [[Bikaner]], [[Bundi]], [[Gondal]], [[Indergadh]], [[Junagadh]], [[Jasdan]], [[Kutch]] Mengni, [[Muli]], [[Morvi]], [[Mangrol]], [[Nawanagar]], [[Nawalgarh]] Palitana, [[Rajkot]], [[Sailana]], [[Sayla]], [[Vithalgadh]], issued "Cash Coupons" to meet the shortage.

==Rupee coinage since the British period==
{{main|Indian coinage|British Indian coins|Modern Indian coins}}
[[Image:Historic Indian Coins (Paise).jpg|thumb|180px|right|(Left to Right) 1961-10 Paise, 1963-5 Paise, 1947(under British Rule)-Quarter Rupee, 1964-1 Paise]]

The British settlements in Western India, [[South India]], and the Eastern Province of [[Bengal]] ([[Calcutta]]) independently developed different coinages in consonance with the local acceptability of the coins for the purposes of trade.

The coins of Bengal were developed in the [[Mughal]] style and those of [[Madras]] mostly in a South Indian style. The English coins of Western India developed along Mughal as well as English patterns. It was only in [[1717]] AD that the English obtained permission from the Emperor [[Farrukh Siyar]] to coin Mughal money at the [[Bombay]] mint. The British gold coins were termed Carolina, the silver coins Anglina, the copper coins Cupperoon and tin coins Tinny. By the early 1830, the English had become the dominant power in India.  The [[Coinage Act of 1835]] provided for uniform coinage throughout India. The new coins had the effigy of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] on the obverse and the value on the reverse in [[English language|English]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. The coins issued after 1840 bore the portrait of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. The first coinage under the crown was issued in 1862 and in 1877 Queen Victoria assumed the title the Empress of India.

The [[1911]] accession to the throne of the King-Emperor [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] led to the famous "pig rupee".  On the coin the King appeared wearing the chain of the Order of the Indian Elephant.  Through poor engraving the [[elephant]] looked very much like a [[pig]].  The [[Muslim]] population was incensed and the image had to be quickly redesigned.

Acute shortage of silver during the [[First World War]], led to the introduction of paper currency of One Rupee and Two and a half Rupees. The silver coins of smaller denominations were issued in cupro-nickel. The compulsion of the [[Second World War]] led to experiments in coinage where the standard rupee was replaced by the "Quaternary Silver Alloy". The Quaternary Silver coins were issued from 1940. In 1947 these were replaced by pure Nickel coins.

Immediately after independence, the British coinage was continued. The Monetary System remained unchanged at One Rupee consisting of 64 pice, or 192 pies.

The "Anna Series" was introduced on 15 August, [[1950]]. this was the first coinage of [[Republic of India]]. The King's Portrait was replaced by the Asoka's Lion Capital. A corn sheaf replaced the Tiger on the one Rupee coin. The monetary system was retained with one Rupee consisting of 16 Annas.  The 1955 Indian Coinage (Amendment) Act, that came into force with effect from 1 April 1957, introduced a "Decimal series". The rupee was now divided into 100 'Paisa' instead of 16 Annas or 64 Pice. 

With high inflation in the sixties, small denomination coins which were made of bronze, nickel-brass, cupro-nickel, and [[Aluminium]]-[[Bronze]] were gradually minted in Aluminium. This change commenced with the introduction of the new hexagonal 3 paise coin. A twenty paise coin was introduced in [[1968]] but did not gain much popularity.

Over a period of time, cost benefit considerations led to the gradual discontinuance of 1, 2 and 3 paise coins in the seventies; Stainless steel coinage of 10, 25 and 50 paise, was introduced in [[1988]] and of one rupee in [[1992]]. The very considerable costs of managing note issues of Re 1, Rs 2, and Rs 5 led to the gradual coinisation of these denominations in the 1990s.

==Decimalisation==
[[Image:newpaisa.jpg|thumb|180px|right|One "Naya" Paisa: one hundredth of a rupee, after decimalisation, 1957]]
During 1835-1957, <sup>[http://www.collectornetwork.com/article_rupee]</sup>

:''1 rupee = 16 annas = 64 pices = 192 pies''

During 1957-64,

:''1 rupee = 100 naya paise''

Since 1964,

:''1 rupee = 100 paise''

The demand for decimalisation existed for over a century. Sri Lanka decimalised its rupee in [[1869]]. The ''Indian Coinage Act'' was amended in September 1955 for the adoption of a metric system for coinage. The Act came into force with effect from 1 April, [[1957]]. The rupee remained unchanged in value and nomenclature. It, however, was now divided into [[100]] '[[Paisa]]' instead of 16 [[Anna]]s or 64 [[Pice]]. For public recognition, the new decimal Paisa was termed 'Naya Paisa' till [[1 June]], [[1964]] when the term 'Naya' was dropped. The coins of that period also mentioned their value in terms of the rupee to avoid confusion and cheating. For example, the one paisa coin carried the text "One hundredth of a Rupee" in Hindi.

After its victory in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870-71), [[Germany]] extracted a huge indemnity from [[France]] of £200,000,000, and then moved to join [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] on a gold standard for currency. France, the [[U.S.]] and other industrialising countries followed Germany in adopting a gold standard throughout the 1870s. At the same time, other countries, such as [[Japan]], which did not have the necessary access to gold or those, such as India, which were subject to imperial policies that determined that they did not move to a gold standard, remained mostly on a silver standard. A huge divide between silver-based and gold-based economies resulted. The worst affected were economies with silver standard that traded mainly with economies with gold standard. With discovery of more and more silver reserves, those currencies based on gold continued to rise in value and those based on silver were declining due to demonetization of silver. For India which carried out most of its trade with gold based countries, especially Britain, the impact of this shift was profound. As the price of silver continued to fall, so too did the exchange value of the rupee, when measured against [[pound sterling]].

Since its Independence in 1947, India has faced two major financial crises and two consequent devaluations of the rupee: In [[1966]] and [[1991]].

===1966 Economic crisis===
Since 1950, India ran continued trade deficits that increased in magnitude in the 1960s. Furthermore, the Government of India had a budget deficit problem and could not borrow money from abroad or from the private corporate sector, due to that sector’s negative savings rate. As a result, the government issued bonds to the RBI, which increased the money supply, leading to inflation. In 1966, foreign aid, which was hitherto a key factor in preventing devaluation of the rupee was finally cut off and India was told it had to liberalise its restrictions on trade before foreign aid would again materialise. The response was the politically unpopular step of devaluation accompanied by liberalisation. Furthermore, The [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]] led the US and other countries friendly towards Pakistan to withdraw foreign aid to India, which further necessitated devaluation. Defence spending in 1965/1966 was 24.06% of total expenditure, the highest it has been in the period from 1965 to 1989 (Foundations, pp 195). The second factor is the drought of 1965/1966. The sharp rise in prices in this period, which led to devaluation, was often blamed on the drought by corrupt governments. 

At the end of 1969, the Indian Rupee was trading at around 13 British Pence. A decade later, by 1979, it was trading at around 6 British Pence. Finally by the end of 1989, the Indian Rupee had plunged to an all-time low of 3 British Pence. This triggered the onset of a wave of irreversible liberalisation reforms away from populist measures.

===1991 Economic crisis===
In 1991, India still had a fixed exchange rate system, where the rupee was pegged to the value of a basket of currencies of major trading partners. India started having balance of payments problems since 1985, and by the end of 1990, it found itself in serious economic trouble. The government was close to default and its foreign exchange reserves had dried up to the point that India could barely finance three weeks’ worth of imports. As in 1966, India faced high inflation and large government budget deficits. This led the government to devalue the rupee.

At the end of 1999, the Indian Rupee was devalued considerably. However in the period 2000-2007, the Rupee stopped declining and stabilized ranging between 1 USD = INR 44-48. However in the mid-2007, the rupee has started gaining strength and for the first time in more than a decade broke the 1 USD = INR 40 barrier. This has led to severe business challenges for Indian firms such as [[Infosys]], [[TCS]] and [[Wipro]] that have benefited considerably from foreign outsourcing.
