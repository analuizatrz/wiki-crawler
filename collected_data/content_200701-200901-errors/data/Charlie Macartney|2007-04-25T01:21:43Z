'''Charles Macartney''' (born [[June 27]], [[1886]], [[Maitland, New South Wales]]; died [[September 9]], [[1958]], [[Little Bay, New South Wales|Little Bay]], [[Sydney, New South Wales]]) was an [[Australian]] [[cricketer]] who played in 35 [[Test cricket|Tests]] between [[1907]] and [[1926]].  He was known as ''The Governor-General''.

He began as an all rounder but his slow left arm bowling gradually gave way to his powerful batting.  Bless with a good eye, strong wrists and fast hands he became a devastating stroke maker on his day, famed for his slashing drives and willingness to pull anything short of a length.  
  
In [[1921]] against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] at [[Trent Bridge]] he made 345 in under four hours with 51 boundaries.  Halfway through the innings he called for a heavier bat.  He made over 2,000 runs on the Australian tours of England in 1912 and 1921.  

He was a [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year]] in [[1922]].

In Australian domestic first-class cricket, Macartney played for [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]]; in 1909-10, he represented the New Zealand domestic side [[Otago Volts|Otago]].

At the age of 40, on the 1926 Australian tour of England, he hit a century before lunch at Headingley, emulating his compatriot [[Victor Trumper]] who achieved the feat at Old Trafford.  He was dropped fourth ball, and was 112 not out at lunch.  He finished with 151, having scored 133 in the previous test at Lord's.  He scored 109 in the next test, joining a select club of test batsman to have scored hundreds in three consecutive games.
