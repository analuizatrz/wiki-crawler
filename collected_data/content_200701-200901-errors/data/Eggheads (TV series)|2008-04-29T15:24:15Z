'''''Eggheads''''' is a [[BBC Two]] [[quiz]] [[game show]] presented by [[Dermot Murnaghan]]. The Eggheads are a team, made up of five British quiz champions who compete against a new panel of challengers each episode.

==Quiz champions==
The quiz champions who compete on the show are:
*[[Kevin Ashman]]: winner of ''[[British Quiz Championship]]'', ''European Quiz Championship'', ''[[World Quizzing Championships]]'', ''[[Fifteen to One]]'', ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]]'', ''[[Brain of Britain]]'' and ''[[Mind Sports Olympiad]]''. 
*[[C. J. de Mooi]]: winner of ''[[BrainTeaser]]'', ''[[100% (game show)|100%]]'' and ''[[The Weakest Link]]'' as well as having been [[Mensa International|Mensa]] chess champion.
*[[Daphne Fowler]]: winner of ''[[Fifteen to One]]'', ''[[Brain of Britain]]'' and ''[[Going for Gold]]''.
*[[Christopher Hughes]]: winner of ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]]'', ''[[International Mastermind]]'' and ''[[Brain of Britain]]''.
*[[Judith Keppel]]: first British winner of one million pounds on ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (UK)#Million pound winners|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]''

==Title sequence==
The title sequence consists of a voiceover by host Dermot Murnaghan, stating 'These five people are amongst the greatest quiz players in Britain. Together they make up the Eggheads, arguably the most formidable quiz team in the country. The question is: can they be beaten?' The five Eggheads are displayed in revolving egg-shaped frames, with a blue background.

==Format==
There are four main rounds, in which the challengers are given a category, and choose one of their players to play against an Egghead of their choice, and they choose whether or not to go first — all aspects designed to give the challengers an advantage. They are asked three [[multiple choice]] questions each; if these result in a tie, non-multiple choice questions are asked in pairs, in a [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]] fashion. Possible categories for these rounds are Arts & Books, Entertainment, Food & Drink, History, Geography, Politics, Science and Sport. The contestants do not know the categories or their order in advance, but are guaranteed that at least one of Entertainment or Sport will come up.

After the main rounds the final takes place, in which the losing players from the main round are not allowed to compete and a dominant team could thus have a 5–1 advantage. All remaining players are allowed to confer and the category is always General Knowledge.

Should the challengers win, they receive £1,000 plus a further £1,000 for each day the Eggheads had previously gone undefeated. Defeat usually leads Murnaghan to ask "Congratulations Eggheads, can anyone beat you?", although, after being beaten on quite a few occasions, the phrase became "Congratulations Eggheads, who will beat you?" The Eggheads have a tendency to show off somewhat, often giving extra information or using obscure cross-references to some of their answers.

==History==
The show has been running for six series, represented by the same five Eggheads.
The teams that have defeated the Eggheads are:
* The ''Unicorn Inn'' from [[Canterbury]], [[Kent]], who won the thirteenth edition on [[26 November]], [[2003]] in a sudden death tie break. 

* ''Spaghetti'', a group of [[Mensa International |mensans]] from the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], who won £19,000. 

* ''Second Class'', a group of postmen won £37,000 on the [[27 September]], [[2006]], which remained the highest win ever for just over a year.

* ''Beer Today, Gone Tomorrow'', a group of students from [[Oxford Brookes University]] won £75,000 on the [[28 September]], [[2007]], the highest prize won on the show so far <ref>[http://www.brookes.ac.uk/about/news/latest/eggheads Brookes students triumph on BBC quiz show — Oxford Brookes University<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. Despite only two of them being in the final round versus four Eggheads (minus Chris), they won by correctly answering the question "Which [[European Union|EU]] capital city is farthest south - [[Lisbon]], [[Valletta]] or [[Nicosia]]?" the answer being Nicosia in [[Cyprus]]. The Eggheads answered the following question incorrectly, believing that eight states in the [[United States]] officially sanction the [[death penalty]] (the correct answer being 38). At the end of the programme, the winners stated that they plan to treat themselves by travelling to Nicosia.

* ''Preston Quizmasters'', won £3,000 on [[3 October]], [[2007]].

* A team from the [[Museum of London]] and the [[Museum in Docklands]] won £33,000 on [[20 November]], [[2007]]. The challengers had just two members in the final round versus four Eggheads (minus Judith), but managed to win after the Eggheads answered one question incorrectly in the final round, believing that actor [[Jeff Goldblum]] had appeared drunk on US chat show [[The View]] in November 2006 when in fact it was [[Danny DeVito]].

* ''Beer and Skittles'', a [[Leicestershire]] pub team from The Unicorn [[Lutterworth]] won £5,000 on [[February 12]], [[2008]]. Two remaining team members beat the 4 Eggheads (minus Chris) in a sudden death tie-break. The Challengers correctly answered that a [[liger]] is the [[offspring]] of a [[male]] [[lion]] and a [[tiger|tigress]], but the Eggheads incorrectly said that the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[god]] of [[dancing|dance]] was [[Krishna]]. The answer was [[Shiva]].

* ''Weakly Players'', a [[Cardiff]]-based amateur dramatics team won £27,000 on [[March 20]], [[2008]]. The Eggheads (minus Daphne) got their final multiple-choice General Knowledge question wrong. The Eggheads believed that [[Radio Happy Isles]] and [[Radio Happy Lagoon]] were broadcast in [[Samoa]], not the correct answer, which was the [[Solomon Islands]].

* ''Sean and the Sheep'', a team comprised of four Welsh people and an Englishman called Sean won £20,000 on [[17 April]], [[2008]].

Occasionally, the show has had some well-known people on the challengers' team. Multi-World Darts Champion [[Phil Taylor]] has appeared, as well as the [[England Women's Cricket Team]] and [[reality TV]] celebrities [[Jade Goody]] and [[Eugene Sully]]. The well known band Groovy Revolution also appeared, and were narrowly beaten by the Eggheads.

==Subjects==
There are eight possible subjects in the head-to-head rounds. Contestants are guaranteed that either Sport or Entertainment (or both) will be one of the chosen four subjects. The other six are:

* Politics
* Arts and Books
* Food and Drink
* History
* Geography
* Science
