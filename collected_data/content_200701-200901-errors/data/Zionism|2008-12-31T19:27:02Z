'''Zionism''' is an international [[Jewish political movements|political movement]] that originally supported the reestablishment of a [[homeland for the Jewish People]] in [[Palestine]] ([[Hebrew]]: ''Eretz Yisra'el'', "the [[Land of Israel]]"), and continues primarily as support for the modern [[state]] of [[Israel]].<ref name=Definition>"An international movement originally for the establishment of a Jewish national or religious community in Palestine and later for the support of modern Israel." ("Zionism," Webster's 11th Collegiate Dictionary). See also [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9078399/Zionism "Zionism"], ''Encyclopedia Britannica'', which describes it as a "Jewish nationalist movement that has had as its goal the creation and support of a Jewish national state in Palestine, the ancient homeland of the Jews," and ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language,'' Fourth Edition, which defines it as "A Jewish movement that arose in the late 19th century in response to growing anti-Semitism and sought to reestablish a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Modern Zionism is concerned with the support and development of the state of Israel." </ref> 

Zionism is partly based upon strong historical ties and [[Judaism|religious traditions]] linking the Jewish people to the [[Land of Israel]], where the concept of Jewish [[nationhood]] first evolved somewhere between 1200 [[Common Era|BCE]] and the late [[Second Temple]] era (i.e. up to 70 [[Common Era|CE]]).<ref>"...from Zion, where King David fashioned the first Jewish nation" (Friedland, Roger and Hecht, Richard ''To Rule Jerusalem'', p. 27).</ref><ref>"By the late Second Temple times, when widely held Messianic beliefs were so politically powerful in their implications and repercussions, and when the significance of political authority, territorial sovereignty, and religious belief for the fate of the Jews as a people was so widely and vehemently contested, it seems clear that Jewish nationhood was a social and cultural reality".

==Terminology==

The word "Zionism" itself is derived from the word [[Zion]] ({{lang-he|ציון, ''Tzi-yon''}}). This name originally referred to [[Mount Zion]], a mountain near [[Jerusalem]], and to the [[Fortress of Zion]] on it. Later, under [[King David]], the term "Zion" became a [[synecdoche]] referring to the entire city of [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Land of Israel]]. In many Biblical verses, the [[Israelites]] were called the people, sons or daughters of Zion.
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:1892 Self Emancipation by Birnbaum.jpg|thumb|left|150px|1892 issue of ''Self Emancipation'' by N. Birnbaum describing the principles of Zionism]] -->

"Zionism" was coined as a term for Jewish [[nationalism]] by [[Austria]]n [[Jew]]ish publisher [[Nathan Birnbaum]], founder of the first nationalist Jewish students' movement ''Kadimah'', in his journal ''Selbstemanzipation'' (''Self Emancipation'') in 1890. (Birnbaum eventually turned against political Zionism and became the first secretary-general of the anti-Zionist [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] movement [[Agudat Israel]].)<ref>De Lange, Nicholas, ''An Introduction to Judaism'', Cambridge University Press (2000), p. 30.  ISBN 0-521-46624-5.</ref>

Certain individuals and groups have used the term "Zionism" as a pejorative to justify attacks on Jews. According to historians [[Walter Laqueur]], [[Howard Sachar]] and [[Jack Fischel]] among others, the label "Zionist" is in some cases also used  as a [[euphemism]] for Jews in general by apologists for [[antisemitism]].<ref>Misuse of the term "Zionism":
*"... behind the cover of "anti-Zionism" lurks a variety of motives that ought to be called by their true name. When, in the 1950s under Stalin, the Jews of the Soviet Union came under severe attack and scores were executed, it was under the banner of anti-Zionism rather than anti-Semitism, which had been given a bad name by Adolf Hitler. When in later years the policy of Israeli governments was attacked as racist or colonialist in various parts of the world, the basis of the criticism was quite often the belief that Israel had no right to exist in the first place, not opposition to specific policies of the Israeli government. Traditional anti-Semitism has gone out of fashion in the West except on the extreme right. But something we might call post-anti-Semitism has taken its place. It is less violent in its aims, but still very real. By and large it has not been too difficult to differentiate between genuine and bogus anti-Zionism. The test is twofold. It is almost always clear whether the attacks are directed against a specific policy carried out by an Israeli government (for instance, as an occupying power) or against the existence of Israel. Secondly, there is the test of selectivity. If from all the evils besetting the world, the misdeeds, real or imaginary, of Zionism are singled out and given constant and relentless publicity, it can be taken for granted that the true motive is not anti-Zionism but something different and more sweeping." ([[Walter Laqueur|Laqueur, Walter]]: ''Dying for Jerusalem: The Past, Present and Future of the Holiest City'' (Sourcebooks, Inc., 2006) ISBN 1-4022-0632-1. p. 55)
*"In late July 1967, Moscow launched an unprecedented propaganda campaign against Zionism as a "world threat." Defeat was attributed not to tiny Israel alone, but to an "all-powerful international force." ... In its flagrant vulgarity, the new propaganda assault soon achieved Nazi-era characteristics. The Soviet public was saturated with racist canards. Extracts from Trofim Kichko's notorious 1963 volume, ''Judaism Without Embellishment'', were extensively republished in the Soviet media. Yuri Ivanov's ''Beware: Zionism'', a book essentially replicated ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', was given nationwide coverage." ([[Howard Sachar]]: ''A History of the Jews in the Modern World'' (Knopf, NY. 2005) p.722

Zionism can be distinguished from [[Territorialism]], a Jewish nationalist movement calling for a Jewish homeland not necessarily in [[Palestine]]. During the early history of Zionism, a number of proposals were made for settling Jews outside of Europe, but ultimately all of these were rejected or failed. The debate over these proposals helped to define the nature and focus of the Zionist movement.

The Zionist movement is structured as a representative democracy.  Congresses are held every four years (they were held every two years before the second World War) and delegates to the congress are elected by the membership. Members are required to pay dues known as a "shekel," At the congress, delegates elected a 30-man executive council, which in turn elects the movement's leader. The movement was democratic from its inception and women had the right to vote (before they won the right in Great Britain).
Until 1917 the WZO pursued a strategy of building a homeland through persistent small-scale immigration and the founding of such bodies as the Jewish National Fund (1901 - a charity which bought land for Jewish settlement) and the Anglo-Palestine Bank (1903 - provided loans for Jewish businesses and farmers).

The 28th Zionist Congress, meeting in Jerusalem 1968, adopted the five points of the "Jerusalem Program" as the aims of Zionism today. They are:<ref>http://www.hagshama.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=497&subject=43</ref>
<blockquote>
#The unity of the Jewish People and the centrality of Israel in Jewish life;
#The ingathering of the Jewish People in its historic homeland, Eretz Israel, through Aliyah from all countries;
#The strengthening of the State of Israel which is based on the prophetic vision of justice and peace:
#The preservation of the identity of the Jewish People through the fostering of Jewish and Hebrew education and of Jewish spiritual and cultural values;
#The protection of Jewish rights everywhere.
</blockquote>

Since the creation of Israel the role of the movement itself has become far less important, however the ideology remains a critical part of Israeli and Jewish political thinking.

==Types of Zionism==
{{Unreferencedsection|date=May 2007}}
Over the years a variety of schools of thought have evolved with different schools dominating at different times.  In addition Zionists come from a wide variety of ethnic groups and at different times Jews of Russian, Polish, American or Moroccan backgrounds have exercised strong influence on the movement's agenda.
 
===Labor Zionism===
{{main|Labor Zionism}}
{{see also|Kibbutz Movement|Kibbutz}}

Labor Zionism originated in Russia. Socialist Zionists believed that centuries of being oppressed in anti-Semitic societies had reduced Jews to a meek, vulnerable, despairing existence which invited further anti-Semitism. They argued that Jews could escape their situation by becoming farmers, workers, and soldiers in a country of their own. Most socialist Zionists rejected religion as perpetuating a "[[Diaspora]] mentality" among the Jewish people and established rural communes in Israel called "[[Kibbutzim]]". Socialist and Labor Zionists are usually atheists or opposed to religion. Consequently, the movement has often had an antagonistic relationship with [[Orthodox Judaism]].

Labor Zionism became the dominant force in the political and economic life of the [[Yishuv]] during the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] and was the dominant ideology of the political establishment in Israel until the [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|1977 election]] when the [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labor Party]] was defeated.  The Labor Party continues the tradition (although it has weakened) and has in recent years taken to advocating creation of a Palestinian State in the West-Bank and Gaza.

===Liberal Zionism===
{{mainarticle|General Zionists}}
General Zionism (or Liberal Zionism) was initially the dominant trend within the Zionist movement from the [[First Zionist Congress]] in 1897 until after the First World War. General Zionists identified with the liberal European middle class (or [[bourgeois]]) to which many Zionist leaders such as Herzl and [[Chaim Weizmann]] aspired. 
Liberal Zionism, although not associated with any single party in modern Israel, remains a strong trend in Israeli politics advocating free market principles, democracy and adherence to human rights.

===Nationalist Zionism===
{{main|Revisionist Zionism}}
Originating from the Revisionist Zionists led by [[Jabotinsky]] who, before independence, advocated the formation of a Jewish Army in Palestine that would force the Arab population to accept mass Jewish migration and promote British interests in the region. 

Revisionist Zionism evolved into the [[Likud]] Party in Israel, which has dominated most governments since 1977.  It advocates Israel maintaining control of the West-Bank and East Jerusalem and takes a hard-line approach in the Israeli-Arab conflict.

===Religious Zionism===
{{main|Religious Zionism}}
{{Wikisourcepar|Zionism an Affirmation of Judaism}}
In the 1920s and 1930s Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] (the first [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbi of Palestine]]) and his son Rabbi Zevi Judah Kook saw great religious and traditional value in many of Zionism's ideals, while rejecting its anti-religious<!-- secular?, please define --> undertones. They  sought to forge a branch of Orthodox Judaism which would properly embrace Zionism's positive ideals and serve as a bridge between Orthodox and secular Jews.

While other Zionist groups have tended to moderate their nationalism over time, the [[Israeli-occupied territories|gains]] from the [[Six Day War]] have led religious Zionism to play a significant role in Israeli political life. Now associated with the [[National Religious Party]] and [[Gush Emunim]], religious Zionists have been at the forefront of Jewish settlement in the West Bank and efforts to assert Jewish control over the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of Jerusalem. 

Religious Zionism is largely [[Modern Orthodox Jew|Modern Orthodox]] but increasingly includes (more traditional) [[Ultra-Orthodox Jews]].  Although the Sephardi party [[Shas]] is not directly associated with the Zionist movement, the party generally pursues an Ultra-Orthodox Zionist agenda.

== Particularities of Zionist beliefs ==

{{main|The "Negation of the Diaspora" in Zionism}}
According to Eliezer Schweid the rejection of life in the Diaspora is a central assumption in all currents of Zionism.<ref>E. Schweid, ‘Rejection of the Diaspora in Zionist Thought’, in ‘’Essential Papers onZionsm, ed. By Reinharz & Shapira, 1996, ISBN 0-8147-7449-0, p.133</ref> Underlying this attitude was the feeling that the Diaspora restricted the full growth of Jewish national life. 

{{main|Revival of the Hebrew language}}  {{see also|Yiddish|Ladino}}
Zionists preferred to speak [[Hebrew]], a [[semitic language]] that developed under conditions of freedom in ancient [[Judah]], modernizing and adapting it for everyday use. Zionists sometimes refused to speak [[Yiddish]], a language they considered affected by [[Christianity and antisemitism|Christian persecution]].  Once they moved to Israel, many Zionists refused to speak their (diasporic) mother tongues and gave themselves new, Hebrew names.

{{main|anti-semitism}}
Zionism is dedicated to fighting anti-semitism. Some Zionists believe that anti-semitism will never disappear (and that Jews must conduct themselves with this in mind<ref>For an example of this view see ''The New Anti-Zionism and the Old Antisemitism: Transformations'' By: Raphael Jospe at http://www.hagshama.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=2095 accessed 16/11/2008</ref>) while others perceive Zionism as a vehicle with which to end anti-semitism.

==History==
{{main |History of Zionism|History of Israel}}

Since the first century CE most Jews have lived in exile, although there has been a constant presence of Jews in the [[Land of Israel]] (Eretz Israel). According to Judaism, Eretz Israel, or [[Zion]], is a land promised to the Jews by God according to the [[Bible]]. Following the 2nd century [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], Jews were expelled from [[Palestine]] by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] to form the [[Jewish diaspora]]. In the nineteenth century a current in Judaism supporting a return grew in popularity. Even before 1897, which is generally seen as the year in which practical Zionism started, Jews immigrated to Palestine, the [[Aliyah#Pre-Zionist aliyah (1200-1882)|pre-Zionist Aliyah]].<ref>C.D.

Jewish immigration to Palestine started in earnest in 1882. Most [[Jewish refugees|immigrants]] came from Russia, escaping the frequent [[pogroms]] and state-led persecution. They founded a number of agricultural settlements with financial support from Jewish philanthropists in Western Europe.  Further [[Aliyah]]s followed the [[Russian Revolution]] and [[Nazi]] persecution. 

In the 1890s [[Theodor Herzl]] infused Zionism with a new [[Der Judenstaat|ideology]] and practical urgency, leading to the first congress at [[Basel]] in 1897, which brought the [[World Zionist Organization]] (WZO) into being.<ref>[http://fusion.dalmatech.com/%7Eadmin24/files/zionism_in-britishpalestine.pdf Zionism & The British In Palestine], by [[Arjun Sethi|Sethi,Arjun]] (University of Maryland) January 2007, accessed May 20, 2007.</ref> Herzl's [[First_Zionist_Congress#Basel_Program|aim]] was to initiate necessary preparatory steps for the attainment a Jewish state.  Herzl’s attempts to reach a political agreement with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rulers of Palestine were unsuccessful and other governmental support was sought. The WZO supported small scale settlement in Palestine and focused on strengthening Jewish feeling and consciousness and building a world-wide federation.

The Russian Empire, with its long record of state organized genocide and ethnic cleansing ("pogroms") was widely regarded as the historic enemy of the Jewish people.  As much of its leadership were German speakers, the Zionist movement's headquarters were located in Berlin. At the start of the First World War most Jews (and Zionists) supported Germany in its war with Russia.

Lobbying by a Russian Jewish immigrant, [[Chaim Weizmann]] and fear that American Jews would encourage the USA to support Germany culminated in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]] by the British government. This endorsed the creation of a Jewish Homeland in Palestine. In addition a Zionist military corps led by [[Jabotinsky]] were recruited to fight on behalf of Britain in Palestine.
In 1922, the [[League of nations]] adopted the declaration in the  [[British mandate of Palestine|Mandate it gave to Britain]]: <blockquote>The Mandatory (…) will secure the establishment of the Jewish national home, as laid down in the preamble, and the development of self-governing institutions, and also for safeguarding the civil and religious rights of all the inhabitants of Palestine, irrespective of race and religion.<ref>League of Nations Palestine Mandate, July 24, 1922, sateofisrael.com/mandate</ref></blockquote> 

Weizmann's role in obtaining the Balfour Declaration led to his election as the movement's leader.  He remained in that role until 1948.

The British Mandate resulted in increased Jewish migration to Palestine and massive Jewish land purchases from feudal landlords, which created landlessness and fueled unrest (often led by the same landlords who sold the land). There were riots in 1920, 1921 and 1929, sometimes accompanied by massacres of Jews. Massacred Jews were sometimes from local non-Zionist orthodox communities. Britain supported Jewish immigration in principle, but in reaction to Arab violence imposed restrictions on Jewish immigration. 

In 1933 Hitler came to power in Germany and, in 1935, the [[Nuremberg Laws]], made German Jews (and later [[Anschluss|Austrian]] and [[Czech Jews]]) stateless refugees. Similar rules were applied by [[Axis powers|Nazi allies]] in Europe. 
The subsequent growth in Jewish migration and impact of Nazi propaganda aimed at the Arab world led to the [[1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine]]. The British established the [[Peel Commission]] to investigate the situation. The commission (which did not consider the situation of Jews in Europe) called for a two-state solution and compulsory [[Population transfer|transfer of populations]].  This solution was subsequently rejected by the British and instead the [[White Paper of 1939]] implemented. This planned to end Jewish immigration by 1944 and to allow no more then 75,000 further Jewish migrants. The British maintained this policy until the end of the Mandate.

Growth of the Jewish community in Palestine and devastation of European Jewish life sidelined the World Zionist Organization. The Jewish Agency for Palestine under the leadership of David Ben-Gurion increasingly dictated policy with support from American Zionists who provided funding and influence in Washington.  
 
After WWII and [[the Holocaust]] the Jewish community in Palestine were universally supported by Jews, especially Holocaust survivors. The British were [[British Conflict with Zionism|attacked in Palestine]] by Zionist groups because of their restrictions on Jewish immigration and eventually forced to refer the issue to the newly created [[United Nations]].

In 1947, the [[United Nations Special Committee on Palestine|UNSCOP]] recommended the partition of western Palestine into a Jewish state, an Arab state and a UN-controlled territory (''[[Corpus separatum]]'') around [[Jerusalem]].<ref>UNITED NATIONS SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON PALESTINE; REPORT TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, A/364, 3 September 1947</ref> This partition plan was adopted on November 29th, 1947 with [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181|UN GA Resolution 181]], 33 votes in favor, 13 against, and 10 abstentions. The vote led to celebrations in the streets of Jewish cities.<ref>[http://youtube.com/watch?v=rEGUPlhtMWQ Three minutes, 2000 years], Video from the Jewish Agency for Israel, via [[YouTube]]</ref>

The Palestinian Arabs and the Arab states rejected the UN decision, demanding a single state and removal of Jewish migrants. On 14 May 1948, at the end of the [[British Mandate of Palestine|British mandate]], the Jewish Agency, led by [[Ben-Gurion]], declared the creation of the State of Israel, and the same day the armies of seven [[1948 Arab-Israeli War|Arab countries invaded Israel]].

The conflict led to an exodus of about 711,000 Arab Palestinians<ref>GENERAL PROGRESS REPORT AND SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONCILIATION COMMISSION FOR PALESTINE, Covering the period from 11 December 1949 to 23 October 1950, GA A/1367/Rev.1 23 October 1950</ref> and the exodus of 850,000 Jews from the Arab world, mostly to Israel. 

Since the creation of the State of Israel, the WZO has functioned mainly as an organization dedicated to assisting and encouraging Jews to migrate to Israel. It has provided political support for Israel in other countries but plays little role in internal Israeli politics.

The movement's major success since 1948 has been in providing logistical support for migrating Jews and, most importantly, in assisting Soviet Jews in their struggle with the authorities over the right to leave the USSR and to practice their religion in freedom.

{{main|Anti-Zionism|Non-Zionism|Post-Zionism|Neo-Zionism|New Antisemitism}}
{{see also|Stalin's antisemitism|Karl_Marx#Marx_and_antisemitism}}
In the twenties the growing secularization of the Zionist movement led to opposition from some Orthodox Jewish groups.  The movement was also opposed by some Marxists, by Islamic and Arab nationalist organizations, by some assimilated Jews and by British Imperialists who feared it would undermine Britain's relations with its many Moslem subjects.

Since the creation of the state of Israel, anti-Zionism has increasingly become associated with anti-Semitism and this has led to claims that there is a [[New Anti-Semitism]] associated with anti-Zionism.

In Israel the [[canaanites (movement)|Canaanite]] movement led by poet [[Yonatan Ratosh]] in the 1930s and 1940s argued that "Israeli" should be a new pan-ethnic [[nationality]].  

During the last quarter of 20th century, the decline of classic nationalism in Israel lead to the rise of two antagonistic movements: [[neo-Zionism]] and [[post-Zionism]]. Both mark the Israeli version of a worldwide phenomenon: the ascendancy of globalization and with it the emergence of a market society and liberal culture, on one hand, and a local backlash on the other.<ref>[[Uri Ram]], ''The Future of the Past in Israel - A Sociology of Knowledge Approach'', in [[Benny Morris]], ''Making Israel'', p.224.</ref> The traits of both neo-Zionism and post-Zionism are not entirely foreign to "classical" Zionism but they differ by accentuating antagonist and diametrically opposed poles already present in Zionism. "Neo Zionism accentuates the messianic and particularistic dimensions of Zionist nationalism, while post-Zionism accentuates its normalising and universalistic dimensions".<ref name = "Chan58">[[Steve Chan]], [[Anita Shapira]], [[Derek Jonathan]], ''Israeli Historical Revisionism: from left to right'', Routledge, 2002, p.58.</ref>

==Non-Jewish Zionism==

Political support for the Jewish return to the Land of Israel predates the formal organization of Jewish Zionism as a political movement.  In the nineteenth century, advocates of the [[Restoration of the Jews to the Holy Land]] were called Restorationists.  The return of the Jews to the Holy Land was widely supported by such eminent figures as [[Queen Victoria]], [[King Edward VII]], [[John Adams]], the second President of the [[United States]], [[Jan Smuts|General Smuts]] of [[South Africa]], [[Tomáš Masaryk|President Masaryk]] of [[Czechoslovakia]],  [[Benedetto Croce]], [[Italy|Italian]] philosopher and historian, [[Henry Dunant]], founder of the [[Red Cross]] and author of the [[Geneva Conventions]], [[Fridtjof Nansen]], [[Norway|Norwegian]] scientist and humanitarian. 

The [[France|French]] government through Minister M. Cambon formally committed itself to “the renaissance of the Jewish nationality in that Land from which the people of Israel were exiled so many centuries ago". 

In [[China]], Wang, Minister of Foreign Affairs, declared that "the Nationalist government is in full sympathy with the Jewish people in their desire to establish a country for themselves."<ref> Palestine: The Original Sin , Meir Abelson [http://www.acpr.org.il/ENGLISH-NATIV/issue1/Abelson-1.htm] </ref>

===Marcus Garvey and Black Zionism===
Zionist success in winning British support for formation of a Jewish National Home in Palestine helped inspire the African-American Nationalist [[Marcus Garvey]] to form a movement dedicated to returning Americans of African origin to Africa. During a speech in [[Harlem]] in 1920 Garvey stated that
<blockquote>
other races were engaged in seeing their cause through&mdash;the Jews through their Zionist movement and the Irish through their Irish movement&mdash;and I decided that, cost what it might, I would make this a favorable time to see the Negro's interest through.<ref>[[Negro World]] 6 March 1920, cited in http://www.international.ucla.edu/africa/mgpp/lifeintr.asp (accessed 29/11/2007).</ref></blockquote>
Garvey established a shipping company, the [[Black Star Line]], to ship Black Americans to Africa, but for various reasons failed in his endeavour. His ideas helped inspire the [[Rastafarian]] movement in Jamaica, the [[Black Jews]]<ref>[http://www.blackjews.org/RabbiBios/RabbiFord.html BlackJews.org - A Project of the International Board of Rabbis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and [[The African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem]] who initially moved to Liberia before settling in Israel.

[[W. E. B. Du Bois]] was an ardent supporter of Zionism, and the [[NAACP]] endorsed the creation of Israel in 1948. [[Paul Robeson]], [[Bayard Rustin]], and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] also supported Zionism.<ref>[http://www.city-journal.org/2008/18_1_evangelicals.html Why Don’t Jews Like the Christians Who Like Them] by James Q. Wilson, City Journal Winter 2008</ref>

===Christian Zionism===
{{main|Christian Zionism}}

Evangelical Christians have a long history of supporting Zionism.  Famous evangelical supporters of Israel include British Prime Ministers [[David Lloyd George]] and [[Arthur Balfour]], President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and [[Orde Wingate]] whose activities in support of Zionism, led the British Army to ban him from ever serving in Palestine. According to Charles Merkley of Carleton University, Christian Zionism strengthened significantly after the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], and many [[Dispensationalism|dispensationalist]] Christians, especially in the United States, now strongly support Zionism.

[[Arabic-speaking Christians|Christian Arabs]] publicly supporting Israel include US author [[Nonie Darwish]], creator of the [http://www.arabsforisrael.com/ Arabs for Israel] web site, and former Muslim [[Magdi Allam]], author of ''Viva Israele'',<ref>ISBN 9788804567776</ref> both born in Egypt. [[Brigitte Gabriel]], a Lebanese-born Christian US journalist and founder of the [[American Congress For Truth]], urges Americans to "fearlessly speak out in defense of America, Israel and Western civilization".<ref>{{cite web|last=anonymous|title=Mission/Vision|publisher=American Congress for Truth|date=unknown|url=http://americancongressfortruth.com/mission-vision.asp|accessdate=2008-04-17}}</ref>

===Muslims supporting Zionism===

Sheikh [[Abdul Hadi Palazzi]], the leader of Italian Muslim Assembly and a co-founder of the [[Islam-Israel Fellowship]], and Canadian [[Imam]] [[Khaleel Mohammed]] find support for Zionism in the [[Qur'an]].<ref>Glazov, Jamie. [http://www.frontpagemagazine.com/Articles/Read.aspx?GUID={AD363EAC-228E-432A-9F15-8702D7765792} "The Anti-Terror, Pro-Israel Sheikh"] ''[[FrontPage Magazine]]'', September 12, 2005. "I find in the Qur'an that God granted the Land of Israel to the Children of Israel and ordered them to settle therein ({{cite quran|5|21|style=ref}}) and that before the [[Qiyamah|Last Day]] He will bring the Children of Israel to retake possession of their Land, gathering them from different countries and nations ({{cite quran|17|104|style=ref}}). Consequently, as a Muslim who abides by the Qur'an, I believe that opposing the existence of the State of Israel means opposing a Divine decree."</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Cobb |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The scathing scholar |quote=despite what Muslims are taught, Islam's holy book, the Koran, supports the right of Israel to exist and for Jews to live there.|url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=604855a0-7b9c-4519-a841-f4736d59eaa1 |work= |publisher=[[The Ottawa Citizen]] |date=February 6, 2007 |accessdate=2008-03-26 }}</ref> Other Muslims who have supported Zionism include Pakistani journalist [[Tashbih Sayyed]]<ref>Neuwirth, Rachel.

On occasion, some Muslims yet non-Arabs such as some [[Kurds]] and [[Berbers]] have also voiced support for Zionism.<ref>"Islam, Islam, Laïcité, and Amazigh Activism in France and North Africa" (2004 paper), Paul A.
