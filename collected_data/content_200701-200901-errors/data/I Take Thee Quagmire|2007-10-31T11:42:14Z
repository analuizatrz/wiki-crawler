__NOTOC__
'''“I Take Thee Quagmire”''' is an episode from the fourth season of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] [[animated television series]] ''[[Family Guy]]''. It guest-starred [[Adam Carolla]] as [[List of characters from Family Guy#Supernatural Characters|Death]], [[Nicole Sullivan]] as Joan and [[Alex Trebek]] as himself. 

==Plot summary==

When [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] makes a surprise win on ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' (with the use of "Z, 4, Q, another Q, a third Q, and the [[Batman]] Symbol"), he wins a free maid (named Joan) for a week. While he shows off how he could cause a huge mess for her to clean up (specifically, giving an exploding watermelon filled with chocolate pudding and M80 Firecrackers to Meg), she meets [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] who immediately falls for her. He gives up his philandering ways and becomes a caring lover. He proposes to Joan. Peter, however, becomes irritated by the changes Quagmire made for his new fiancee.

Meanwhile, [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] is concerned when [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]]’s teeth cause her pain during [[breastfeeding]]. [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] suggests that Lois begin weaning Stewie, to which Stewie objects.

During the reception for his [[wedding]], [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] turns back into his old self when he notices Lois’s [[Breast engorgement|engorged breasts]]. That night, he attempts to dump Joan, but she threatens suicide if they ever break-up, forcing Quagmire to pretend he was joking. Realizing his mistake, he enlists help from his friends to get him out of it quick, at one point asking Cleveland how he got out of his marriage, to which Cleveland replies “You slept with my wife!”, a reference to the episode “[[The Cleveland-Loretta Quagmire]].” They choose to fake his death. 

The following day, Peter, Joe and Cleveland inform Joan of Quagmire's tragic "death" and to prove it, present an extremely unconvincing video which features Quagmire being attacked by a wheelchair-bound Ninja (Joe), a popgun wielding Nazi (Cleveland), a tin-pot robot (Peter) and then finally being eaten by a [[Tyrannosaurus Rex|T-Rex]] (which is in fact just a toy being waved in front of the camera by Peter and to the tune of [[Jurassic Park]], hummed by Peter.). Not surprisingly, Joan doesn't believe them, which forces them to switch to their backup plan - Quagmire returns home, and then immediately fakes death from a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. 

Peter's plan to dig up Quagmire's coffin is jeopardized when it's revealed that Mayor West has enacted a law that means all coffins must be buried under ten feet of concrete (in order to prevent [[zombie]] attacks), and Peter is forced to pull the still-living Quagmire out of the coffin in front of the attendees. Joan is relieved, but Death has come and must collect a body. Joan jumps in front of Quagmire and touches Death, which kills her. Quagmire’s friends then inform Death that her last name was Quagmire and that she was suicidal, and so Death takes her body, allowing Quagmire to live.

==Notes==
{{Trivia|date=October 2007}}
* [[Chris Griffin]] does not appear in this episode (although he does appear in a deleted scene).
* This episode was rated TV-MA when it first premiered on Cartoon Network (for sexual content and violence, specifically the scene where Joan threatens to kill herself when Quagmire asks her for a divorce and the subplot about Lois’s breasts). In all reruns, the rating is changed to TV-14 for suggestive dialogue (D) and violence (V), however, one airing (on April 18, 2007) had the rating changed to TV-14 for suggestive dialogue (D) and sexual situations (S).
* The ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' scene seems to be a mix of the classic and the current format, for this portrayal is almost completely factually accurate down to the shopping (though the shopping segment hasn’t been shown on ''Wheel of Fortune'' since the late 1980s), the bonus round with only five consonants and a vowel, the ceramic dalmatian which was frequently offered as a prize, the $25,000 sign, and a near-perfect rendition of the 1980s “Changing Keys” theme song. However, some current features, such as the prize wheel and the electronic puzzle board, is also shown.
* This episode’s ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' scene includes one of the few times that Mayor West’s apparent delusions were proven correct, and sends [[Alex Trebek]] back to the fifth dimension by making Alex say his name backwards. On the [[June 15]], [[2007]] episode of ''Jeopardy!'', Jared Cohen, a contestant who was in third place with $1, used "Kebert Xela" as his Final Jeopardy! answer in a reference to this episode. Interestingly enough, Alex does not say his name in the same manner as he did in the ''Family Guy'' episode.

==DVD exclusive scenes==

On the DVD version when Peter decides to fake Quagmire’s death, he adds “This will be better than that soda I invented,” then goes to a cutaway of Peter pitching [[Crystal Pepsi]] and stating that it’s better than regular [[Pepsi]], in case someone comes at the drinker with a knife and the drinker can’t see past the regular Pepsi. According to DVD commentary, this scene was rejected because of a Standards and Practices rule where a TV show couldn’t favor a product that’s not a show sponsor.

In the collection of deleted scenes on the ''Family Guy'' Volume 4 DVD, after Quagmire’s request for a divorce gets shot down by Joan threatening to slit her wrist, there is a scene where Quagmire says that whatever problems they have shouldn’t be solved so drastically and gives the example of the time Chris Griffin thought he was pregnant. It then goes to a cutaway of Chris (in what would have been his only appearance in this episode had this scene aired) refusing a tuna sandwich from Lois and complaining that the mercury in the tuna could kill the baby he’s supposedly carrying.

==Cultural references==
* The scene where Alex Trebek is sent to another dimension is a reference to the ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' character [[Mister Mxyzptlk]], who is sent back to the fifth dimension when he is tricked into saying his name backwards.
* A cutaway shows Peter throwing a [[Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]] at [[Ashton Kutcher]]. He then says, "You’ve just been Tomahawk’d! That’s my show...Tomahawk’d.", parodying Kutcher's prank show [[Punk'd|Punk’d]].
* This episode shares some similaries to the [[King of the Hill]] episode, ''Dang Ol' Love'', where a sex-crazed bachelor finds real love.
