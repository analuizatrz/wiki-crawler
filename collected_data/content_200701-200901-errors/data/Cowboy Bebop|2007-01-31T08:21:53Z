{{nihongo|'''Cowboy Bebop'''|カウボーイビバップ|Kaubōi Bibappu}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] series created by [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]] and directed by [[Shinichiro Watanabe]].  It follows the adventures of four misfortuned [[bounty hunter]]s travelling on their spaceship, the Bebop, in the year [[2071]].

''Cowboy Bebop'' was a commercial success both in [[Japan]] and worldwide, especially the [[United States]]. It was later expanded into a [[motion picture]], two [[manga]] series, and [[video games]]. [[Sony]] Pictures released the ''Cowboy Bebop'' movie, ''[[Cowboy Bebop: The Movie|Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]'' to theaters worldwide, and followed up with an international [[DVD]] release. Two ''Cowboy Bebop'' manga series were created based on the anime; as well as two video games, one for each the [[PlayStation]] and [[PlayStation 2]] consoles.

''Cowboy Bebop'' is strongly influenced by [[American music]], especially the [[jazz]] movements of the [[1940]]s, [[1950]]s and [[1960]]s and the early [[Rock and roll|rock]] era of the [[1950]]s, [[1960]]'s and [[1970]]'s. Nearly all of its action sequences, from space battles to hand-to-hand [[martial arts]] [[combat]], are set and timed to music. Music is a driving force within the series. Episodes are called ''Sessions'' (in reference to musicians playing a "jam session"), and titles are either borrowed from an album's or a song's name (''Sympathy for the Devil''), or make use of a genre name (''Mushroom Samba''), that will influence the whole episode's action and musical theme.

==Plot==
{{spoilers}}
In the year [[2071]], the crew of the spaceship ''Bebop'' travel the [[solar system]] trying to apprehend bounties. In the slang of the era, "Cowboys" are bounty hunters. Most episodes revolve around a bounty; however, the overall focus of the show concerns the deep pasts of each character and of more general past events, which unravel and connect as the series progresses.

'''The Plot commonly reaches into the following subplots:'''

[[Spike Spiegel]] is a former member of the Red Dragon crime syndicate who is haunted by a past love triangle between his former syndicate partner, [[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Vicious|Vicious]], and a mysterious woman named [[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Julia|Julia]].

[[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Faye Valentine|Faye Valentine]] is an amnesiac, awakened from a 50-year cryogenic slumber. Her past (a mystery, even to herself) is unravelled progressively throughout the series.

[[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Jet Black|Jet Black]] is a former ISSP officer and the owner of the Bebop. He bears a [[cybernetic]] arm, a constant reminder of his past in the ISSP.  He is, like Spike, haunted by the memory of a woman: Alisa, his longtime girlfriend who left him without notice.

[[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV|Edward]] is a wacky, genius computer [[hacker]].  There is a popular confusion as to Ed's gender (she is a girl).  She gave herself her full name (Edward Wong Hau Peplu Tivrusky IV) after being abandoned at an orphanage by her father.

[[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Ein|Ein]] is a former lab animal "data dog" (the terminology is never explained) who was enhanced with super intelligence. He is usually depicted to be just a regular dog.{{endspoiler}}

{{main|List of Cowboy Bebop episodes}}
[[Image:BebopGateway.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The Bebop emerges from a [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] gate.]]
In the year [[2021]], a series of ring-shaped [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] gateways were constructed across the solar system, allowing for easy [[interplanetary travel]]. Unfortunately, the gate network contained a fatal instability that was ignored by the contractors who built the system. The instability grew until a gateway near Earth exploded, releasing a powerful burst of energy that cracked the [[Moon]]. In a cataclysmic disaster referred to as "The Gate Incident", meteoric debris from the devastated Moon rained down on the planet, destroying much of Earth's surface. The death toll was cataclysmic; around 4.7 billion lives were lost. People mostly live underground, as debris continues to rain down on the planet daily, although a sizable number of people refuse to leave or simply can't afford to. Most, however, left Earth after the Gate Incident and spread out across the solar system, living in colonies on [[Venus (planet)|Venus]], [[Mars (planet)|Mars]], some habitable [[asteroid]]s, [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and the [[Galilean moon|Galilean moons of Jupiter]] as well as many [[space station]]s and a penal colony on on [[Pluto]]. The total population of the solar system in [[2071]], when the series takes place, is only 1.5 billion.<ref>[http://surbrook.devermore.net/adaptionsanime/bebop/cbseeyou.html http://surbrook.devermore.net/adaptionsanime/bebop/cbseeyou.html]</ref>

Many of [[Mars]]' [[impact crater]]s were domed and transformed into thriving metropolitan areas for those who could afford it. [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] was [[Terraform|terraformed]], with oxygen provided by a species of oxygen-producing plants floating in the atmosphere. This is not a perfect process, however, as the spores of these plants ultimately cause “Venus Sickness” for some people. This condition, left untreated, may lead to blindness or death, and the proper treatment is extremely expensive. Many moons of Jupiter, such as [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], [[Io (moon)|Io]], and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], have been terraformed and colonized with varying degrees of success. Callisto is a dreary, cold and inhospitable moon (with the city of Blue Crow having an all-male population), while Io is a volcanic ball of sand with a toxic atmosphere. Meanwhile, Ganymede is almost completely covered by water and is known for its fishing industry. [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn's]] largest moon, is a barren desert world the population of which has been at war since the [[2060]]s (Titan War II in [[2068]] which was survived by veterans such as Vincent Volaju, Gren, and Vicious). There is even a Solar System Penitentiary on [[Pluto (planet)|Pluto]], and certain [[asteroid]]s have been colonized for their minerals and other [[natural resources]].

Sometime after the advent of space travel, the [[bounty system]] of the [[Old West]] was reinstated by the government to help curb growing crime levels. Bounty hunters are encouraged to capture criminals and return them (alive and relatively unharmed) to the authorities for a large reward. These bounty hunters are now referred to as "Cowboys" in slang. In addition, ruthless crime syndicates have much influence in the [[Solar System]], indulging in such fields as [[bribery]], [[murder]], [[extortion]], [[drug dealing]], [[money laundering]] and other [[criminal offence]]s. At some point between the present day and the events of ''Cowboy Bebop'', the [[Woolong]] was established as a universal [[currency]]. [[Paper money]] became less common as more people carry convenient money cards and rely on digital transfers.

The technology in the world of ''Cowboy Bebop'' has undergone advancements to accommodate 21st century life in the [[Solar System]]. In order to make travel between hyperspace gates faster and more efficient, a variety of [[Starship|spaceships]] are used. Most are designed to simply accommodate a single-pod cockpit that can be ejected and navigated independently of the ship itself. The system of operation for a majority of these spaceships is known as the “Machine Operation Navigation of Outer Space,” or simply, “MONO.” Medical advancements such as [[artificial organ]]s and [[cryogenics|cryogenic freezing]] have been mastered and are in full use. Home entertainment hardware called “Alpha Catch” provide a mind-machine interface for capturing or projecting images, games and movies. [[Virtual world|Virtual reality gaming]] is the standard and analog hardware such as videocassettes ([[VHS]] or [[Betamax|beta]]) can only be found as [[antiques]]. Finally, the [[Internet]], once known as the [[World Wide Web]], has evolved into a massive [[Solar System Web]] (SSW).

==Longevity==
A poll in the [[Japan]]ese magazine ''[[Newtype (magazine)|Newtype]] USA'' asked its readers to rank the "'''Top 25 Anime Titles of All Time'''"; Cowboy Bebop placed at number two on a list that included ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' and ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]''.<ref>''[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/pressrelease.php?id=632 Newtype Press Release]'' - ''[[Anime News Network]]''</ref>

In the U.S., [[Cartoon Network]] has regularly rotated ''Cowboy Bebop'' in and out of its [[Adult Swim]] block line-up several times. The network has also moved Cowboy Bebop out of its anime lineup periodically in order to show other anime features such as ''[[Read or Die]]'' and ''[[Blue Gender]]''. It is currently not airing on Adult Swim.<ref>''http://www.adultswim.com/schedule/index.html''</ref>

In a recent poll by TV Asashi, Cowboy Bebop came in at 40 for Japan's Favorite Anime of 2006.<ref>''http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2006-10-13/japan's-favorite-tv-anime''</ref>

''Cowboy Bebop'' almost did not make it on Japanese broadcast television due to its depictions of violence. It was first sent to [[TV Tokyo]], one of the main broadcasters of anime in Japan. However, at the time it was cracking down on violence and sexuality in anime after the notoriously controversial broadcast of ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' between 1995-1996. The show had an aborted first run beginning on April 3, 1998 and running until June 19, 1998 on TV Tokyo, broadcasting only episodes 2, 3, 7-15 and 18. There have been rumours that the network purposely tried to "sabotage" the series (perhaps due to the climate in the aftermath of [[Neon Genesis Evangelion|Evangelion]]), but there is evidence to suggest the time slot after April 23 was already booked, leaving little room for the new series. In fact, the episode XX is said to be protest by staff for the treatment of the show. Later that year, the series was shown in its entirety beginning on October 23 and running until April 23, 1999 on the satellite network [[WOWOW]]. With this broadcast slot fiasco, the whole production schedule was completely shot enough that the last episode was in fact turned over to WOWOW on the day of broadcast. The full series has also been broadcast across Japan by the anime television network, [[Animax]], who have also aired the series via its respective networks across Southeast Asia, South Asia and East Asia. ''Cowboy Bebop'' was popular enough that a movie, ''[[Cowboy Bebop: The Movie|Cowboy Bebop: Tengoku no Tobira]]'' (''Knockin' on Heaven's Door''), was commissioned and released in Japan in 2001 and later released in the United States as ''Cowboy Bebop: The Movie'' in 2003.

In 2001, ''Cowboy Bebop'' became the first anime title to be shown as part of the U.S. [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]] programming block. It has been successful enough that it continues to be broadcast regularly until present. The success of ''Cowboy Bebop'' paved the way for Adult Swim's showing of mature anime, including ''[[InuYasha]]'', ''[[Lupin III|Lupin the Third]]'', ''[[Trigun]]'', ''[[Blue Gender]]'', ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]'', ''[[FLCL]]'', ''[[Witch Hunter Robin]]'', ''[[Samurai Champloo]]'', ''[[Wolf's Rain]]'', even ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion|Evangelion]]'' itself, which had made the original Japanese TV-run so infamous in the first place with its graphic violence and [[psychodrama]]-oriented content (and almost derailed Cowboy Bebop).
* In the [[United Kingdom]], ''Cowboy Bebop'' was first broadcast in 2003 as one of the highlights of the ill-fated 'cartoon network for adults', [[CNX]].
* In [[Australia]] ''Cowboy Bebop'' was first broadcast in 2002 on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]], and began broadcasting on [[ABC2]], a digital free-to-air network, on January 2, 2007.
* In [[France]] ''Cowboy Bebop'' was broadcast during summer 2000 on [[Canal+]].
* In [[Germany]] ''Cowboy Bebop'' was broadcast during 2003-2004 on [[MTV]].
* In [[Poland]], ''Cowboy Bebop'' was broadcast several times by [[Hyper (tv channel)|Hyper]] and [[TVP Kultura]].
* In [[Israel]], ''Cowboy Bebop'' was broadcast during 2001-2002 on [[Bip]]'s late-night anime block.
* In [[Spain]], ''Cowboy Bebop'' was broadcast during 1999 in Buzz and the summer of 2006 on [[Cuatro]]'s late-night show Cuatroesfera.
* In [[Canada]], ''Cowboy Bebop'' is set to finally make its debut on December 24, 2006 on the young adult-oriented specialty station, [[Razer]]
* In [[Italy]], ''Cowboy Bebop'' was broadcast after november 1999 on [[MTV]].
* In [[Singapore]], ''Cowboy Bebop'' was broadcast on [[Arts Central]] at the 11pm time slot, and had several scenes cut for violence and other graphic content.

[[Bandai]] released a ''[[Cowboy Bebop (PlayStation game)|Cowboy Bebop]]'' [[shoot 'em up]] [[Computer and video games|video game]] in [[Japan]] for the [[PlayStation]] in 1998. A [[PlayStation 2]] ''[[Cowboy Bebop (PlayStation 2 game)|Cowboy Bebop]]'' video game has been released in [[Japan]], and the English version had been set for release in North America during the first quarter of 2006; however, as of June 2006, there has been no release date set for the American release.

In [[2005]], seven years after its original Japanese broadcast, ''Bebop'' was finally licensed and released in the European market by [[Beez]], an extension of Bandai Entertainment.

[[Image:CBOST02NoDisc.jpg|right|200px|thumb|''Cowboy Bebop's'' 2nd Original Soundtrack CD, entitled ''[[No Disc (album)|No Disc]]''.]]
{{main|The Seatbelts}}

One of the most notable elements of ''Cowboy Bebop'' is its music, performed by [[Yoko Kanno]] and [[The Seatbelts]], a band Kanno assembled to perform music for the series. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the jazz-and-blues-themed soundtrack is as much of a defining factor in the series as the characters, writing, and even animation; many fans find the soundtracks enjoyable to listen to as albums on their own merits independent of the series.

[[Tim Jensen]] produced lyrics on songs:
* "[[Ask DNA]]" sung by [[Raj Ramayya]]
* "Gotta knock a little harder" sung by [[Mai Yamane]]
* "Call me, call me" sung by [[Steve Conte]]

''Cowboy Bebop'' was voted by [[IGN]] in 2006 as having the greatest soundtrack for an [[anime]].<ref>[http://music.ign.com/articles/708/708910p1.html IGN: Top Ten Anime Themes and Soundtracks of All-Time], IGN.</ref>

==Influences==
[[Image:CowboyBebopPo.jpg|right|thumb|250px|'' Promotional poster of Cowboy Bebop'']]

''Cowboy Bebop''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s influences are many and varied.

* Spike's character had mainly been attributed by creators to the Japanese actor [[Yusaku Matsuda]] from the Japanese TV series and movie entitled ''[[Tantei Monogatari]]''. It is from Matsuda that Spike is credited for receiving his unique hair style and other physical features.{{fact}}
* According to mechanical designer Kimitoshi Yamane's notes, Spike's ''Sword Fish II'' MONO racer was inspired by Britain's [[Fairey Swordfish]] torpedo-bomber of World War II. The ''Cowboy Bebop'' movie includes a cameo of the Fairey SwordFish along with a dialogue reference to the sinking of the Bismarck battleship (Fairey Swordfish bombers were crucial to the sinking of the Bismarck). There is also fan speculation that the ''Sword Fish II'' is based on the ''Swordfish'', an experimental airplane in [[Edgar P. Jacobs]]' comic series ''[[Blake and Mortimer]]'', although the creators have not stated this.{{fact}}
* Several characters in the series are based on real-life personalities. Ted Bower, a.k.a. Teddy Bomber or TB, the bounty in Session #22 "Cowboy Funk", is based on real-life terrorist bomber [[Theodore Kaczynski]], a.k.a. [[Unabomber]]. Doctor Londes in Session #23 "Brain Scratch" is based on [[Marshall Applewhite]] of the [[Heaven's Gate]] cult.{{fact}}
* Episode titles are heavy on music and popular cultural references. Episodes are labeled "sessions" as in jam sessions. Several episodes titles are song names and album titles, or even film titles. For instance, Session #14 "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" (song by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]), Session #15 "[[My Funny Valentine]]" ([[jazz standard]]), Session #20 "[[Pierrot Le Fou]]" (film title).{{fact}}
*[[Bruce Lee]] is an important influence on Cowboy Bebop vis-à-vis Spike Spiegel. Spike's martial arts background is in [[Jeet Kun Do]], Bruce Lee's martial arts style. Bruce Lee's films also are referenced in dialogue, scenes and character design. In Session #02 "Stray Dog Strut", [[Way of the Dragon]] was mentioned by Spike in a conversation with a store owner, while the bounty , Abdul Hakim, is based on the villain in Bruce Lee's last film [[Game of Death]]. Spike's kung-fu lesson to Rocco in Session #08 "Waltz for Venus" is based on a similar scene in [[Enter the Dragon]].{{fact}}

==Content ratings==
The certifications for ''Cowboy Bebop'' are '''TV-14''' in the USA (after editing some content), '''M''' and '''MA''' in Australia, '''PG''' in Singapore, '''G''' and '''13+''' in Quebec, Canada (different episodes on video received different ratings), and '''PG''', '''12''', and '''15''' in Britain (different episodes received different ratings and were not rated for TV when it aired before the conventional watershed of 9pm at 8.30pm), and '''16''' in Poland and Germany.

''Cowboy Bebop'' contains strong violence, language, and brief nudity. Some of the language and nudity has been edited out of the English translation aired on Cartoon Network, but not on [[CNX]]. It is retained in the DVD releases.
