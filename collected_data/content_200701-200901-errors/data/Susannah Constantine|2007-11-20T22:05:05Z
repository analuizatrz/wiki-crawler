He was a talented artist and was offered worldwide art exhibitions, although too modest to accept. His death came suddenly and was a landmark for Constantine.<ref name="deceivingappearances" /> 

Constantine became a fixture in 1980s British gossip columns and newspapers as the result of her relationship with [[Princess Margaret of the United Kingdom|Princess Margaret]]'s son, [[David, Viscount Linley]] which lasted for eight years.<ref name="BookDeal"/> Princess Margaret thought highly of Constantine and even called her "my daughter-in-law".<ref name="Interview"/> Constantine admitted that her relationship with Linley undeniably opened doors for her, but after they broke up, she was keen to put the episode behind her and become well-known in her own right.<ref name="scrubbing"/> She has also had a relationship with Pakistan cricket captain [[Imran Khan]], but she is now married to Danish entrepreneur and businessman Sten Bertelsen, who launched Death cigarettes,<ref name="scrubbing"/> and with whom she has three children; Joe, Esme and CeCe.<ref name="therapists"/><ref name="Swells" /> They have recently bought a 120-acre property in [[Sussex]].<ref name="therapists"/> [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]] is godmother to one of her children.<ref>Louise Compton.
