'''''Outrageous Betrayal: The Dark Journey of Werner Erhard from est to Exile''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book on [[Werner Erhard]], written by legal [[journalism|journalist]] [[Steven Pressman]]. The book was published in [[1993]] by [[St. Martin's Press]].  ''Outrageous Betrayal'' book gives an account of Werner Erhard's early life, his exploration of various forms of [[self-improvement]] techniques including [[Scientology]] and [[Mind Dynamics]], and his foundation of [[Erhard Seminars Training]] and later [[Werner Erhard and Associates]].  Pressman details the quick financial success Erhard had with these companies, as well as controversies relating to litigation involving some former participants in his courses.  The work concludes by going over the impact of a [[March 3]], [[1991]] ''[[60 Minutes]]'' broadcast on [[CBS]] where family members made allegations of abuse against Erhard, and his decision to leave the [[United States]].

The book received positive reviews in ''[[Library Journal]]'' and ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', but ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' noted the flashy title of the book itself, and questioned why the author did not discuss the methodology and claimed results of graduates of est and The Forum.  The book has later been cited by works on [[psychology]], [[cult]]s and [[new religious movement]]s, for historical background on Erhard and his companies.  ''Outrageous Betrayal'' has also been cited in testimony before the [[United States House of Representatives]], for background on est, Werner Erhard, and The Forum.  In 1998, [[Landmark Education]], the successor company to The Forum, attempted to compel Steven Pressman to reveal [[Journalism sourcing|confidential sources]] he had consulted while researching ''Outrageous Betrayal.'' This matter was later dropped after Landmark Education settled litigation against the [[Cult Awareness Network]] (CAN).  As a result of this settlement, CAN agreed not to sell copies of ''Outrageous Betrayal'' for at least five years after it emerged from [[bankruptcy]].

== Contents ==
In ''Outrageous Betrayal'', Steven Pressman gives a chronological account of Werner Erhard's life and businesses, from high-school years through his formation of companies that delivered [[Large Group Awareness Training|awareness training]] and the later controversies surrounding his business and family life.  The book goes into detail regarding his early life as Jack Rosenberg and his name change to Werner Erhard, his move to [[California]], and the initial inspirations behind the training that would come to be known as "est."  Pressman writes that Erhard was inspired by the [[self-help]] course [[Mind Dynamics]], [[cybernetics]], the book ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]'' by [[Napoleon Hill]], and by [[Scientology]] and the writings of [[L. Ron Hubbard]].  He also notes how Erhard was helped in the formation of his first awareness training company, [[Erhard Seminars Training]], by an attorney skilled in [[Taxation in the United States|tax law]].<ref name="publishers" /><ref name="library" />

Pressman notes how Erhard and his businesses became successful within two years of foundation, and writes that his awareness training programs trained over half a million people in his courses and brought in tens of millions of dollars in revenue.  The book then describes controversies relating to both Erhard's businesses and his reported treatment of his family.  Pressman details some of the lawsuits and professional desertions that hurt his business, as well as some of his conflict with the [[Internal Revenue Service]].  The end of the book describes the impact and aftermath of a [[March 3]], [[1991]] ''[[60 Minutes]]'' [[investigative journalism|investigation]] on [[CBS News]], where one of his daughters accused him of [[sexual abuse]].  Pressman also describes the successor company to est, [[Werner Erhard and Associates]], and Erhard's decision to sell the "technology" of Erhard's course The Forum to his employees and leave the [[United States]].<ref name="publishers" /><ref name="library" /><ref name="kirkus" />

== Reception ==
''Outrageous Betrayal'' received a positive review in ''[[Library Journal]]'', where the book was described as "a compelling account of the 1980s guru who rose from selling used cars to peddling personal transformation."<ref name="library">{{cite news | last = Annichiarico| first = Mark | coauthors = | title = Pressman, Steven.

An analysis in ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' noted the choice of title by the author, and asserted that Pressman: "makes no pretense to objectivity here: His Werner Erhard is a charismatic but abusive con man with a genius for repackaging and marketing others' ideas."<ref name="kirkus">{{cite news  | last = Staff | first = | coauthors = | title = Outrageous Betrayal, review | work = [[Kirkus Reviews]] | pages = | language = | publisher = Kirkus Associates, LP., [[Nielsen Company]] | date = 1993 | url = http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/0312092962 | accessdate =  2007-10-26}}</ref>  The review briefly summarized key points of the book, and noted that even Pressman did not know of Erhard's whereabouts at the time of publication.<ref name="kirkus" />  ''Kirkus Reviews'' criticized ''Outrageous Betrayal'' for not delving into the nature of the est training itself, noting that by concentrating on the negative aspects of Erhard's life, the work fails to explain why the est seminars appealed to so many people.<ref name="kirkus" />  Other books on subjects related to [[psychology]], [[cult]]s and [[new religious movement]]s have later referenced ''Outrageous Betrayal'' for background on Werner Erhard and the est movement, including [[Janja Lalich]]'s ''[[Bounded Choice]]'' and Irvin Yalom's ''The Theory and Practice of Group Psychotherapy''.<ref>{{Citation | last = Bardini | first = Thierry | author-link =

==Lawsuit over confidential sources==
In 1998, [[Landmark Education]] spent months attempting to compel Steven Pressman to respond to deposition questions aimed at obtaining the [[Journalism sourcing|confidential sources]] he used for research on ''Outrageous Betrayal''.<ref name="skolnik">{{cite news | last = Skolnik | first = Peter L. | coauthors = Michael A.

However, Pressman concluded that the deposition questioning was mainly a form of harassment.<ref name="skolnik" />

The discovery commissioner who entered an interim order in the matter, commented that: "..it does not appear that the information sought [from Mr. Pressman] is directly relevant or goes to the heart of the [CAN] action, or that alternative sources have been exhausted or are inadequate."  The action against Pressman was dropped after the Cult Awareness Network litigation was settled.<ref name="litigation">{{cite news  | last = Skolnik | first = Peter L. | coauthors = Michael A.
