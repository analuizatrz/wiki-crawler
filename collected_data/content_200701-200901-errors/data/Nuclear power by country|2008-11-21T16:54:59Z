[[Nuclear power]] is a method for [[Electricity generation|generating energy]] by harnessing the [[Radioactive decay|radioactivity]] of atoms. [[Nuclear fission]] occurs when any fissile material, such as [[uranium-235]], an [[isotope]] of [[uranium]], is concentrated. This causes a [[nuclear chain reaction]], which releases large amounts of heat, boiling water and producing [[steam]], which can drive a [[steam turbine]].</onlyinclude>

__TOC__
Although nuclear power generates many [[Watt#Megawatt|megawatts]] of power, the [[Nuclear power#Risks|risks]] posed by spent nuclear fuel that many regard as "waste" along with high initial costs to build such plants often make it a controversial choice. As a result, different nations have very different attitudes towards nuclear power; some, such as [[France]], generate most of their electricity by nuclear power. Others, have [[Nuclear decommissioning|decommissioned]] their plants or, some, such as [[Germany]] are planning to decommission all of their nuclear power stations. Still others are reconsidering their decommissioning and are planning on starting a revived nuclear industry, such as [[Italy]]. Many nations are have publicly announced their decision to start new nuclear power plant infrastructure development, among these are: Jordan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, United Arab Emirates and Nigeria.

In addition to the nations listed below, several other nations, such as [[Australia]], have research reactors, but no plans to diverge into commercial nuclear power; only the commercial reactors registered with the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] are listed below. Nations are listed first by number of reactors, then by peak power output in megawatts. Regions in ''italics'' are added for comparison.

==Notes==
<div class="references-small">
#{{note label|Lith|a|a}}One of the conditions of [[Lithuania|Lithuania's]] entry into the [[European Union]] was that the [[Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant]], Lithuania's only nuclear plant, be closed on safety grounds. As a result, Lithuania has proposed a replacement to be built on the same site.<ref name="IPS">[http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=33379 Baltic States Plan Nuclear Expansion], Giedrius Blagnys, [[Inter Press Service]], [[May 26]] [[2006]]</ref>
#{{note label|Nork|b|b}}[[North Korea]] has four incomplete reactors, two frozen in 1994 under the [[U.S.-North Korea Agreed Framework]], and two under construction by [[Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization|KEDO]] until suspended in 2003. An experimental 5&nbsp;MWe reactor is operating at the [[Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center]].
#{{note label|Pol|c|c}} The nearly completed [[Å»arnowiec Nuclear Power Plant]] was abandoned in the early 1990s. There is wide political consensus that Poland needs at least 2 nuclear power plants in the north of Poland but no biding decisions have been made so far.
