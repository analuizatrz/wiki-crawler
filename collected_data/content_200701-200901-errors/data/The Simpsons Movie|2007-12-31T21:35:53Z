'''''The Simpsons Movie''''' is a [[2007 in film|2007]] [[Cinema of the United States|American]] [[animation|animated]] [[comedy film]] based on the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. The film was directed by [[David Silverman]], produced by [[James L. Brooks]], [[Matt Groening]], [[Al Jean]], [[Mike Scully]], and [[Richard Sakai]], and written by Scully, Jean, Brooks, Groening, [[George Meyer]], [[David Mirkin]], [[Mike Reiss]], [[John Swartzwelder]], [[Jon Vitti]], [[Ian Maxtone-Graham]], and [[Matt Selman]]. It stars the regular television cast of [[Dan Castellaneta]], [[Julie Kavner]], [[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Yeardley Smith]], [[Hank Azaria]], [[Harry Shearer]], [[Tress MacNeille]] and [[Pamela Hayden]] and features [[Albert Brooks]] in a prominent guest role, as well as [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Green Day]] in smaller ones.

After previous attempts to create a film version of ''The Simpsons'' had failed because of script length and lack of staff, production began in 2001. The writers conceived numerous plot ideas, with Groening’s being the one developed into a film. The script was re-written over one hundred times continuing after animation had begun. This meant that hours of finished material was cut, including cameos from [[Isla Fisher]], [[Minnie Driver]], [[Erin Brockovich]], [[Edward Norton]] and [[Kelsey Grammer]]. Tie-in promotions were made with several companies, including [[Burger King]] and [[7-Eleven]], which [[Kwik-E-Mart#7-Eleven promotion|transformed select stores]] into [[Kwik-E-Mart]]s. The film premiered in [[Springfield, Vermont|Springfield]], [[Vermont]], which won the right to hold it through a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] competition. The film was a box office success, and received overall positive reception from film critics.

==Plot==
<!--If you do not want spoilers, then do not read this section. Please keep plot to this length, no spoiler tags. It is a basic over view of the film, not a blow by blow description of jokes.-->
[[Green Day]] is performing on Lake Springfield, where they fail to engage the audience in discussing the [[environmentalism|environment]]. They are killed when the pollution in the lake erodes their barge, causing it to sink. At the funeral, [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa]] has a [[prophecy|prophetic]] vision, in which he predicts impending doom upon the town, but only [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] takes it seriously. Her environmentalist daughter [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and an [[Irish people|Irish]] boy, [[List of one-time characters from The Simpsons#The Simpsons Movie|Colin]] hold a seminar where they convince the town to clean up the lake. Meanwhile, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] adopts a pig, which causes his now neglected son [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] to seek a parental figure in neighbor, [[Ned Flanders]]. Homer keeps the pig's feces in an overflowing silo, which horrifies Marge, who tells Homer to dispose of it safely. However, Homer is distracted and instead dumps the silo into the lake, critically polluting it. Moments later, a squirrel jumps into the lake and becomes severely mutated. Nearby, Flanders and Bart bond during a hike and discover the squirrel which is captured by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]. [[List of one-time characters from The Simpsons#The Simpsons Movie|Russ Cargill]], head of the EPA, takes drastic action by enclosing [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] in a giant glass dome.

When the police discover Homer's silo in the lake, an angry mob approaches the Simpsons' home and sets it on fire. The family escapes through a [[sinkhole]] in [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]'s sandbox and flees to [[Alaska]]. Meanwhile, cracks in the dome start to form and Cargill, not wanting news of what he has done to become widespread, plans Springfield's destruction. The Simpsons see a television advertisement which promotes a new [[Grand Canyon]] to be located where Springfield is. Marge and the kids decide to save the town, but Homer refuses to help the people that tried to kill them. They abandon him and leave to rescue Springfield, only to be captured and placed back in the dome. After a visit with a mysterious [[Inuit mythology|Inuit shaman]], Homer has an epiphany that he must "become selfless" and save the town and proceeds to do so. Just as he arrives, a helicopter appears above Springfield and lowers a bomb suspended by rope through a hole in the dome. Homer climbs to the peak of the dome and descends the rope, knocking the escaping townspeople and bomb off. Homer then notices a motorcycle, and grabs the bomb. He reunites with Bart and the pair cycle up the side of the dome and Bart throws the bomb through the hole, seconds before detonation. The bomb explodes shattering the dome. The town praises Homer, who rides off with Marge on the motorcycle into the sunset. The film concludes with the townspeople restoring Springfield back to normal.

==Production==
===Development===
The production staff of ''The Simpsons'' had entertained the thought of a film since early in the series, but production never came together. The show's creator [[Matt Groening]] felt a feature length film would allow them to increase the show's scale and animate sequences too complex for a TV series.<ref name=creators>{{cite news | author = Edward Douglas | title = The Creators of The Simpsons Movie! | publisher = Comingsoon.net | date = [[2007-07-24]] | url = http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=22484 | accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> He intended the film to be made after the show ended, "but that [...] was undone by good ratings."<ref name=variety/> There were attempts to turn the [[The Simpsons (season 4)|season 4]] episode "[[Kamp Krusty]]" into a film, but difficulties were encountered in expanding the episode to feature length.<ref>{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt; Al Jean, Mark Kirkland, David Silverman|year=2004|title=The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[Kamp Krusty]]"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> For a long time the project was held up. There was trouble finding a story that was right for a film, and the crew did not have enough time to complete such a project, as they already worked full time year-round on the show.<ref name="avclub">{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/47771/3|title=Matt Groening interview with The A.V.

{{quotebox|width=50%|quote="If every episode of "The Simpsons" is a celebration, which we try to make it, then the movie is like a big celebration.

[[Ian Maxtone-Graham]] and [[Matt Selman]] joined later, and Brooks, Groening, Scully, and Jean also wrote parts of the script.<ref name=officialsite/> [[Sam Simon]] did not return having left the show over creative differences in 1993, nor did [[Conan O'Brien]], who wanted to work with the ''Simpsons'' staff again. O'Brien joked, "Truth be told, I worry that the ''Simpsons''-writing portion of my brain has been destroyed after 14 years of talking to [[Lindsay Lohan]] and that guy from ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', so maybe it's all for the best."<ref>{{cite news | author = Dan Snierson | title = D'Oh! | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20035285_20035331_20046980,00.html | accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref> The same went for [[Brad Bird]] who "entertained fantasies of asking if [he] could work on the movie", but did not have enough time because of work on ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]''.<ref name="empire"/> The producers arranged a deal with Fox that meant they could abandon production at any point if they felt the script was not going anywhere.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/movies/moviesspecial/06itzk.html | title = D'oh!

===Animation===
[[Image:David Silverman in 2007-cropped.JPG|right|thumb|Director [[David Silverman]] looked at some of the television episodes he directed for inspiration.]]
Animation for the film began in January 2006,<ref name="pig feces"/> with the ''[[Itchy & Scratchy]]'' short being the first scene to be [[Storyboard|storyboarded]].<ref name=com>{{cite video | people=Brooks, James L.; Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Scully, Mike; Silverman, David; Castellaneta, Dan; Smith, Yeardley|year=2007|title=Audio commentary| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Groening rejected making either a [[live action]] or a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] film,<ref name="totalfilm"/> describing the film's animation as being "deliberately imperfect", and "a tribute to the art of hand-drawn animation, which is basically disappearing."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6273738.stm|title='Clumsy' Simpsons movie promised|accessdate=2007-07-05|date=[[2007-07-05]]|author=Neil Smith|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> The film was animated in a wider [[anamorphic format|2.35:1]] aspect ratio than the television series,<ref name=officialsite/><ref name=com/> and colored with the largest palette the animators ever had available to them.<ref name=creators/> A lot of the animation was done on [[Wacom#Cintiq|Wacom Cintiq]] tablets, a technique which enables the image to be drawn directly on to a computer monitor, which meant that the film could be animated, colored and edited together more quickly.<ref name=com/> The film was animated at four different studios around the world: [[Film Roman]] in [[Burbank, California]]; [[Rough Draft Studios]] in [[Glendale, California]]; and [[AKOM]] and Rough Draft Korea in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]].

Director [[David Silverman]] said that unlike the TV series where "you've got to pick and choose," the film allowed the opportunity to "lavish that attention with every single scene that we do," also noting that the characters have shadows.<ref name=nytimes/> Silverman and the animators looked to ''[[The Incredibles]]'', ''[[Les Triplettes de Belleville|Triplets of Belleville]]'', and ''[[Bad Day at Black Rock]]'' for inspiration as they were "a great education in staging because of how the characters are placed."<ref name=nytimes/> They also looked at ''[[Dumbo]]'' and the [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]] cartoon ''Pluto's Judgment Day'' for a dream sequence,<ref name="totalfilm"/> and ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' for crowd scenes.<ref name=moviesonline/> Silverman also looked at some of the episodes he had directed, primarily his two favorites "[[Homie the Clown]]" and "[[Three Men and a Comic Book]]".<ref name=silvermaninter>{{cite news|url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/feature.asp?article=2280|title=Interview: 'Simpsons Movie' Director David Silverman Loves Making D'oh|accessdate=2007-07-31|date=[[2007-07-31]]|author=Peter Brown|publisher=iF Magazine}}</ref> [[Mike B.

===Casting===
As inspiration for the crowd scenes in the film, the production staff spent a long time looking at the ''Simpsons'' poster that features more than 320 of the show's characters.<ref name=ew>{{cite news | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20035285_20035331_20035330,00.html | title = Inside 'The Simpsons Movie' | accessdate = 2007-05-05 | author = Dan Snierson | date = [[2007-04-27]] | publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> Groening said that they did try to put every single character into the film, with 98 having speaking parts,<ref name="pig feces"/> and the crowds being filled with previously established characters rather than just generic people.<ref name=com/> The series regulars [[Dan Castellaneta]], [[Julie Kavner]], [[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Yeardley Smith]], [[Hank Azaria]], and [[Harry Shearer]], and semi-regular performers [[Tress MacNeille]], [[Pamela Hayden]] and [[Marcia Wallace]] reprised their roles.<ref name=variety/> [[Joe Mantegna]] returned as [[Fat Tony]],<ref name="fattony">{{cite news|url=http://www.creators.com/lifestylefeatures/hollywood-exclusive/jon-cryer-and-lisa-joyner-plan-june-wedding-joe-mantegna-pulls-eclectic-string-of-roles.html|title=Jon Cryer and Lisa Joyner Plan June Wedding/Joe Mantegna Pulls Eclectic String of Roles|accessdate=2007-04-11|publisher=creators.com}}</ref> while [[Albert Brooks]], who supplied many guest voices in episodes, was hired as Russ Cargill,<ref name=officialsite>{{cite web|url=http://www.simpsonsmovie.com/main.html|title=About the DVD|publisher=The Simpsons Movie.com|accessdate=2007-11-29}} Go to the Simpson's house, click on Lisa's book, then on "Production Notes".</ref> after he told the staff that he wanted to be part of the film.<ref name=moviesonline/> For "about a week", he was to reprise the role of [[Hank Scorpio]] from the episode "[[You Only Move Twice]]", but the staff realized that creating a new character was a better idea.<ref name=com2/>

Although he does not provide the voice, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] is [[President of the United States]] in the film. He was chosen ahead of the incumbent President [[George W.

===Editing===
Every single aspect of the film was constantly analyzed, with storylines, jokes and characters regularly being re-written.<ref name="com"/> Although most animated films do not make extensive changes to the film during active production due to budget reasons,<ref name="empire"/> ''The Simpsons Movie'' crew continued to keep playing with their film even into 2007, with some edits taking place as late as May.<ref name=com/> James L. Brooks noted, "We saw a trailer the other day, and somebody said 70 percent of the things in it - based on where we were eight weeks ago - are no longer in the movie, because we keep on fooling around."<ref name=ew/> Groening said enough material for two more movies was cut.<ref name="totalfilm"/> Various new characters were created, who were cut as they did not contribute much.<ref name="empire"/> Marge was to have the religious possession in the church, but the writers considered this idea too dark and changed it to Grandpa.<ref name=com/> The role of Lisa's love interest Colin was frequently revised. He had previously been named Dexter and Adrien, and had his appearance completely revised.<ref name=moviesonline/> One idea saw [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] in the role, but it was changed to a new character when the staff realized "the audience was not as familiar with Milhouse's long-standing crush on [Lisa] as [they had] thought."<ref name=com/> A large-scale [[car chase]] where Homer throws flaming [[mummies]] out of a truck at the EPA was cut, and replaced with the more emotional and realistic scenes at the motel and carnival, allowing a change of pace.<ref name=com/> 

Further changes were made after a March 2007 preview screenings of the film in [[Portland, Oregon]] and [[Phoenix, Arizona]],<ref name=com/> including the deletion of [[Kang and Kodos]] heavily criticizing the film during the [[closing credits|end credits]].<ref name="pig feces"/> A lot of people at the screenings found the original film too [[wiktionary:coarse|coarse]], and some of Homer's behaviour too horrible, so several scenes were eased down to make him nicer.<ref name=com/> Russ Cargill was re-designed several times, originally appearing as an older man whose speech patterns Brooks based on [[Donald Rumsfeld]]. The older model was the one used by [[Burger King]] for the action figure.<ref name=com/> Cargill's scene with Bart and Homer at the film's conclusion was added in to fully resolve his story.<ref name=moviesonline/> The "[[List of animals in The Simpsons#Plopper|Spider-Pig]]" gag was a late addition, and one excised scene, before the dome is put over Springfield, had Mr. Burns reminding viewers that it was the last point in the film that they could get a refund.<ref name=com/> Other deletions included Homer's encounter with a sausage truck driver, a scene with Plopper the pig at the end,<ref name=ploppersback>{{cite news|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/808/808965p1.html|title=SDCC 07: The Simpsons Panel|accessdate=2007-07-29|author=Eric Moro|date=[[2007-07-28]]|publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref> and several musical numbers throughout.<ref name="com"/> A news report, showing the dome's effect on daily life in Springfield in areas such as farming and sport, was cut as it failed in the overall context of the film.<ref name=com/>
