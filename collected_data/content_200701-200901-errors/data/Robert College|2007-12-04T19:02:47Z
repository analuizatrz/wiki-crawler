The Institution is the oldest American school still in existence in its original location outside of the [[United States]].<ref name=ed>This title is also claimed by the [[American College of Sofia]], founded in 1860.</ref> Robert College is accredited by the [[New York State Association of Independent Schools]], [[European Council of International Schools]], [[Council of International Schools]] and [[International Baccalaureate Organization]].

Robert College has a long list of [[List of notable Robert College alumni|notable alumni]], including entrepreneurs, political leaders, journalists, artists and one Nobel Prize recipient, [[Orhan Pamuk]].

== History ==
In 1863, Robert College was founded in [[Bebek]] as the oldest American high school outside the borders of the United States. The school was founded by [[Christopher Robert|Christopher Rhinelander Robert]], a wealthy American and a philanthropist, and [[Cyrus Hamlin]], a [[missionary]] devoted to education. Six years after its foundation, with the permission ({{Lang-ota|irade}}) of the [[Ottoman Sultan]], the first campus (at present, it is the South Campus of [[Boğaziçi University]]) was built in [[Bebek]] at the ridge of [[Rumelihisarı|Rumelia Fortress]], very close to a [[Bektashi]] tekke, whose leaders maintained an excellent relationship with the [[Unitarian]] founders of Robert. The first building of the school was named "Hamlin Hall" in memory of [[Cyrus Hamlin]].

After Hamlin's death, Robert College was successfully administrated by [[George Washburn]] (1877-1903) and [[Caleb Gates]] (1903-1932). Though founded at the time of the [[Ottoman Empire]] as an institution of higher learning serving the Christian minority of the Balkans and the foreigners living in [[Istanbul]], the school adopted a strictly secular educational model in accordance with the republican principles of [[Turkey]] in 1923. Robert College, in the past had [[junior high school]], [[high school]], and [[university]] sections under the names ''Robert Academy'', ''Robert Yüksek'' and ''American College for Girls''. Since [[1971]], the school has functioned only as a "high school" (more comparable to the French ''lycée'' in academic rigor) on its [[Arnavutköy]] campus (formerly the campus of ''American College for Girls''), yet it retains the title of College. The [[Bebek]] campus was donated to the [[Republic of Turkey]] for use as the campus ground for what is now a a leading public institution of higher learning, namely [[Boğaziçi University]].
<br />

{{cquote|Through the education of succeeding generations of students, Robert College has assisted the economic and social progress in the Near East. It has also brought direct benefits to several generations of Americans- faculty members, trustees, students, contributors, and other friends of the College. Their close association with the heroic and hospitable people of Turkey has led to a greater appreciation of Turkish life and culture and the strong foundations on which the Republic of Turkey, our close friend and partner in peace, has been built.
