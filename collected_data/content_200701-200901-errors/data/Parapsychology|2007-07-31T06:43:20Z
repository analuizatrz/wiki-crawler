'''Parapsychology''' (from the [[Greek]]: ''para'', "alongside" + ''psychology'') is the study of [[paranormal]] psychological phenomena, such as [[extra-sensory perception]], [[psychokinesis]], and [[Life after death|survival of consciousness]] after death. Those who study such phenomena in the field of parapsychology are known as ''parapsychologists''. ''[[Psi]]'' is a general blanket term used by parapsychologists to describe these processes without suggesting how the phenomena are caused or experienced.<ref>Thouless, R. H. (1942). "Experiments on paranormal guessing". ''British Journal of Psychology'', ''33'', 15-27.</ref> Parapsychological work today takes place at a small number of universities and privately funded laboratories, notably in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]].  Parapsychological work has been published in mainstream journals including ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]'', ''[[Foundations of Physics]]'', and the ''British Journal of Psychology'', as well as specialist publications such as the [[Journal of Parapsychology]].

Parapsychological research uses many different methodologies, such as historical surveys, philosophical discussion, cross-cultural studies, case studies, field investigations, laboratory experiments, statistical analysis of large databases, and mathematical/theoretical models.<ref name=faqfile1> {{cite web|url=http://www.parapsych.org/faq_file1.html |title=Parapsychological Association FAQ |accessdate=2007-07-02 |date=1995 |publisher=Parapsychological Association}}</ref>  The experimental methods of parapsychologists include the use of [[random number generators]] to test for psychokinesis, mild sensory deprivation in the [[Ganzfeld experiment]] to test for [[extra-sensory perception]], and research trials conducted under contract by the U.S. government to investigate [[remote viewing]]. The statistical methods of parapsychologists have generated a number of [[meta-analyses|meta-analytical]] studies, which combine the data from several previous experiments into one large data set.  Although all of the research methods of parapsychology have contributed to the field, the experimental and statistical methods have attracted much attention and debate.  

Some scientists such as psychologists [[Ray Hyman]] and James A. Alcock are critical of the methods and results of parapsychology. Some critics say that parapsychology is a [[fringe science]] because it involves research that doesn't fit within [[Scientific modelling|standard theoretical models]] accepted by [[Scientific consensus|mainstream science]], or regard the work of parapsychologists as a [[pseudoscience]].<ref name=Beyerstein /> Others say that apparently successful experimental results are best explained as methodological flaws, as opposed to actual paranormal phenomena. To date, no experimental results have been accepted by the mainstream [[scientific consensus|scientific community]] as providing irrefutable evidence for paranormal phenomena.

==History==
The term ''parapsychology'' was coined in or before 1889 by psychologist [[Max Dessoir]]. It was adopted by [[J.B. Rhine]] in the 1930s as a replacement for the term ''psychical research'', to indicate a significant shift toward laboratory methodologies applied to the study of [[psi]] phenomena.<ref name=Melton>{{cite book |last=Melton |first=J. G. |authorlink= |title=Parapsychology. In Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology |publisher=[[Thomson Gale]] |date=1996 |pages= |isbn=978-0810394872}}</ref>

===Early psychical research===
[[Image:Wm_james.jpg| thumb| right| 125px| American psychologist and philosopher William James (1842-1910) was an early psychical researcher.]]

The [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR) was founded in London in 1882. The SPR was the first systematic effort to organize scientists and scholars for a critical and sustained investigation of paranormal phenomena. The early membership of the SPR included philosophers, scholars, scientists, educators and politicians, such as [[Henry Sidgwick]], [[Arthur Balfour]], [[William Crookes]], and [[Charles Richet]].<ref name=Beloff>{{cite book |last=Beloff |first=John |authorlink= |title=Handbook of parapsychology |publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold |date=1977 |pages= |isbn=0442295766}}</ref>

The SPR classified its subjects of study into several areas: telepathy, [[hypnotism]], [[apparitions]], [[hauntings]], and the physical aspects of [[spiritualism]] such as table-tilting and the appearance of matter from unknown sources, otherwise known as [[Materialization (paranormal)|materialization]]. One of the first collaborative efforts of the SPR was its ''Census of Hallucinations'', which researched [[apparitional experiences]] and [[hallucinations in the sane]]. The census was the Society's first attempt at a statistical evaluation of paranormal phenomena, and the resulting publication in 1886, ''Phantasms of the Living'' is still widely referenced in parapsychological literature today. The SPR became the model for similar societies in other European countries and the United States during the late 19th century. Largely due to the support of William James, the [[American Society for Psychical Research]] (ASPR) opened its doors in [[New York City]] in 1885.<ref name=Berger>{{cite book |last=Berger |first=Arthur S. |authorlink= |coauthors=Berger, Joyce |title=The Encyclopedia of Parapsychology and Psychical Research |publisher=Paragon House Publishers |date=1991 |pages= |isbn=1557780439}}</ref>
 
Today, the SPR and ASPR continue the investigation of psi phenomena. The SPR's purpose, as stated in every issue of its ''Journal'' is "to examine without prejudice or prepossession and in a scientific spirit those faculties of man, real or supposed, which appear to be inexplicable on any generally recognized hypothesis."<ref>{{cite book |last=Wooffitt |first=Robin |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Language of Mediums and Psychics: The Social Organization of Everyday Miracles |publisher=Ashgate |date=2006 |pages= |isbn=075464202X}}</ref>

===The Rhine era===

In 1911, [[Stanford University]] became the first academic institution in the [[United States]] to study [[Extra-sensory perception]] (ESP) and [[Psychokinesis]] (PK) in a laboratory setting. The effort was headed by psychologist John Edgar Coover. In 1930, [[Duke University]] became the second major U.S. academic institution to engage in the critical study of ESP and psychokinesis in the laboratory. Under the guidance of [[William McDougall]], and with the help of others in the department, including [[Karl Zener]], [[Joseph B. Rhine]] and Louisa E. Rhine, laboratory ESP experiments  began, using volunteer subjects from the undergraduate student body.  As opposed to the approaches of psychical research, which generally sought [[Qualitative research|  qualitative evidence]] for paranormal phenomena, the experiments at Duke University proffered a [[Quantitative research|  quantitative]], [[statistical]] approach using cards and dice.  As a consequence of the ESP experiments at Duke, standard laboratory procedures for the testing of ESP developed and came to be adopted by interested researchers throughout the world.<ref name="Berger"/>

The publication of J.B. Rhine's book, ''New Frontiers of the Mind'' (1937), brought the laboratory's findings to the general public.  In his book, Rhine popularized the word "parapsychology," which Max Dessoir had coined over forty years earlier, to describe the research conducted at Duke.  Rhine also founded an autonomous Parapsychology Laboratory within Duke, and started the ''[[Journal of Parapsychology]]'', which he co-edited with McDougall.  

The parapsychology experiments at Duke evoked much criticism from academic psychologists who challenged the concepts and evidence of ESP. Rhine and his colleagues attempted to address these criticisms through new experiments, articles and books, and summarized the state of the criticism along with their responses in the book ''Extra-Sensory Perception After Sixty Years''.

The administration of Duke grew less sympathetic to parapsychology, and after Rhine's retirement in 1965, parapsychological links with the university were broken. Rhine later established the Foundation for Research on the Nature of Man (FRNM) and the Institute for Parapsychology as a successor to the Duke laboratory.<ref name="Berger"/>  In 1995, the centenary of Rhine's birth, the FRNM was renamed the Rhine Research Center. Today the Rhine Research Center is a parapsychology research unit that "aims to improve the human condition by creating a scientific understanding of those abilities and sensitivities that appear to transcend the ordinary limits of space and time."<ref>{{cite web |title=The History of the Rhine Research Center |publisher=Rhine Research Center |url=http://www.rhine.org/f_hist.htm |accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>

===Establishment of the Parapsychological Association===

The [[Parapsychological Association]] (PA) was created in [[Durham, North Carolina]], on [[June 19th]], [[1957]]. Its formation was proposed by [[J. B. Rhine]] at a workshop on parapsychology, which was held at the Parapsychology Laboratory of Duke University. Rhine proposed that the group form itself into the nucleus of an international professional society in parapsychology. The aim of the organization, as stated in its Constitution became "to advance parapsychology as a science, to disseminate knowledge of the field, and to integrate the findings with those of other branches of science".<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the Parapsychological Association |url=http://www.parapsych.org/history_of_pa.html |work=The Parapsychological Association |accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> In 1969, the PA was elected an affiliate of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS), the largest general scientific society in the world.  The PA consists of about three hundred full, associate and affiliated members worldwide, and maintains its affiliation with the AAAS today.  The annual AAAS convention provides parapsychologists with a forum for presenting their research to scientists from other fields and for advancing parapsychology in the context of the AAAS's lobbying on national science policy.<ref name=Harvey>{{cite book |last=Irwin |first=Harvey J. |authorlink = |title=An Introduction to Parapsychology, Fourth Edition |publisher=McFarland & Company |date=2007 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jB88qA7C9oYC&dq=An+Introduction+to+Parapsychology.&pg=PP1&ots=L53QIyz2qx&sig=-2bQfPeTt1QDFDJN_RzNSgQ4ZCs&prev=http://www.google.com/search%3Fhl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26channel%3Ds%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26hs%3D0AF%26sa%3DX%26oi%3Dspell%26resnum%3D0%26ct%3Dresult%26cd%3D1%26q%3DAn%2BIntroduction%2Bto%2BParapsychology.%26spell%3D1&sa=X&oi=print&ct=title

===A decade of increased research (1970s)===

The affiliation of the Parapsychological Association (PA) with the American Association for the Advancement of Science, along with a general openness to psychic and [[occult]] phenomena in the 1970s, led to a decade of intense parapsychological research. During this period, other notable organizations were also formed, including the Academy of Parapsychology and Medicine (1970), the Institute of Parascience (1971), the Academy of Religion and Psychical Research, the [[Institute of Noetic Sciences]] (1973), the International Kirlian Research Association (1975), and the [[Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Laboratory]] (1979). Parapsychological work was also conducted at the [[Stanford Research Institute]] during this time.<ref name="Melton"/>

The scope of parapsychology expanded during these years. [[Ian Stevenson]] conducted much of his controversial research into [[reincarnation]] during the 1970s. [[Thelma Moss]] devoted time to the study of [[Kirlian photography]] at [[UCLA]]'s parapsychology laboratory. The influx of spiritual teachers from the East, and their claims of abilities produced by [[meditation]], led to research on [[altered states of consciousness]]. [[Russell Targ]] introduced the term [[remote viewing]] in 1974.<ref name="Melton"/>

During this period, academics outside parapsychology also appeared to have a general optimism towards this research. In 1979, a survey of more than 1,100 college professors in the United States found that only 2% of [[psychologists]] expressed the belief that [[extra-sensory perception]] was an impossibility. A far greater amount, 34%, indicated that they believed [[ESP]] was either an established fact or a likely possibility. The percentage was even higher in other areas of study. 55% of [[natural science|  natural scientists]], 66% of [[social scientists]] (excluding psychologists), and 77% of academics in the [[arts]], [[humanities]], and [[education]] believed that ESP research was worthwhile.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wagner |first= M. W |authorlink= |coauthors=Monnet, M. |title=Attitudes of college professors toward extra-sensory perception |journal=Zetetic Scholar |issue=5 |pages=7-17 |date=1979}}</ref>

The surge in paranormal research continued throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s. By the end of the 1980s the Parapsychological Association reported some 300 members working in more than 30 countries. Additionally, research not affiliated with the PA was being carried out in [[Eastern Europe]] and the former [[Soviet Union]].<ref name="Melton"/>

===Parapsychology today===
Contemporary parapsychological research has waned considerably. Early research was considered inconclusive, and parapsychologists were faced with strong opposition from their academic colleagues. Some effects thought to be paranormal, for example the effects of Kirlian photography, disappeared under more stringent controls, leaving new avenues of research at dead-ends. Many university laboratories in the United States have closed, citing a lack of acceptance by mainstream science as the reason, leaving the bulk of parapsychology confined to private institutions funded by philanthropic sources.<ref name="Melton"/>  Other laboratories, notably the [[Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Laboratory]] (PEAR), closed feeling they had accomplished their goal of proving the existence of parapsychological effects, despite the lack of acceptance by mainstream scientists. PEAR ended its active research in February 2007, having gathered data from tens of millions of trials over 28 years.<ref name=Smee> {{cite journal |title=The lab that asked the wrong questions |journal=Nature |date=2007-03-01 |first=Lucy |last=Odling-Smee |issue=446 |pages=10-11 |doi=10.1038/446010a |url=http://intl.emboj.org/nature/journal/v446/n7131/full/446010a.html |accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>

Two universities in the United States still have academic parapsychology laboratories: the Division of Perceptual Studies, a unit at the [[University of Virginia]]'s Department of Psychiatric Medicine, studies the possibility of survival of consciousness after bodily death; the [[University of Arizona]]'s Veritas Laboratory conducts laboratory investigations of [[mediums]]. Several private institutions, including the Institute of Noetic Sciences and others, conduct and promote parapsychological research. [[UK|Britain]] leads parapsychological study in [[Europe]], with privately funded laboratories at the universities of [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], [[University of Northampton|Northampton]] and [[Liverpool Hope University|Liverpool Hope]], among others.<ref name="Smee"/> 

Parapsychological research has also been augmented by other sub-disciplines of psychology. These related fields include [[transpersonal psychology]], which studies transcendent or spiritual aspects of the human mind, and anomalistic psychology, which examines paranormal beliefs and subjective anomalous experiences in traditional psychological terms.<ref name=cardenza>{{cite book |last=Cardena  |first=Etzel |authorlink= |title=Varieties of Anomalous Experience: Examining the Scientific Evidence

==Research==

===Scope===

Parapsychologists study a number of ostensible paranormal phenomena, including but not limited to:

*'''[[Telepathy]]''': Transfer of information on thoughts or feelings between individuals by means other than the [[Sense#Five_classical_senses|five classical senses]].
 
*'''[[Precognition]]''': Perception of information about future places or events before they occur.

*'''[[Clairvoyance]]''': Obtaining information about places or events at remote locations, by means unknown to current science.

*'''[[Psychokinesis]]''': The ability of the mind to influence matter, time, space, or energy by means unknown to current science.

*'''[[Reincarnation]]''': The rebirth of a soul or other non-physical aspect of human [[consciousness]] in a new physical body after death.

*'''[[Haunting|Hauntings]]''': Phenomena often attributed to ghosts and encountered in places a deceased individual is thought to have frequented, or in association with the person's former belongings.

The definitions for the terms above may not reflect their [[mainstream]] usage, nor the opinions of all parapsychologists and their critics. Many critics, for example, feel that parapsychologists are engaged in the study of phenomena that disappear under stringent experimental conditions and are thus normal processes.

According to the Parapsychological Association, parapsychologists do not  study all paranormal phenomena, nor are they concerned with [[astrology]], [[UFOs]], [[Bigfoot]], [[paganism]], [[vampires]], [[alchemy]], or [[witchcraft]].<ref name=faqfile1 />

===Methodology===

Parapsychologists employ a variety of approaches during the study of apparent paranormal phenomena. These methods include qualitative approaches used in traditional psychology, but also quantitative [[empirical]] methodologies. Their more controversial studies involve the use of [[meta-analyses]] in examining the [[Statistics| statistical]] evidence for [[Psi (parapsychology)| psi]].<ref name="Smee"/>

===Experimental research===
====Ganzfeld====
[[Image:Ganzfeld.jpg| thumb|left| 150px| Participant of a [[Ganzfeld|Ganzfeld experiment]] which proponents say may show evidence of telepathy.]]

{{main| Ganzfeld experiment}}

The [[Ganzfeld experiment| ganzfeld]] (German for "whole field") is a technique used to test individuals for telepathy.  The technique was developed to quickly quiet mental "noise" by providing a mild, unpatterned sensory field to mask the [[visual]] and [[auditory]] environment. Isolating the visual sense is usually achieved by creating a soft red glow which is diffused through half ping-pong balls attached to the recipient's eyes. The auditory sense is usually blocked by playing white noise, static, or similar sounds to the recipient. The subject is also seated in a reclined comfortable position to minimize the sense of touch. 

In the typical ganzfeld experiment, a "sender" and "receiver" are isolated, the receiver is put into the ganzfeld state, and the sender is shown a video clip or still picture and asked to mentally send that image to the receiver. The receiver, while in the ganzfeld, is asked to continuously speak aloud all mental processes, including images, thoughts, feelings. At the end of the sending period, typically about 20 to 40 minutes in length, the receiver is taken out of the ganzfeld and shown four images or videos, one of which is the true target and three are non-target decoys. The receiver attempts to select the true target, using perceptions experienced during the ganzfeld state as clues to what the mentally "sent" image might have been. The results of scores of such experiments, and over 3,000 individual sessions conducted by about two dozen investigators world-wide, have been interpreted by parapsychologists such as [[Charles Honorton]] as indicating that the target image is selected on average about 32% of the time.<ref name=Radnin97>{{cite book |last=Radin |first=Dean |authorlink = |title=The Conscious Universe: The scientific Truth of Psychic Phenomena |publisher=HarperSanFrancisco |date=1997 |pages= |isbn=0062515020}}</ref> By chance alone, receivers should be able to select the correct target 25% of the time. Because the results are said to be [[Statistical significance| statistically significant]], they have sparked debates within mainstream academic psychology journals over how to properly interpret the data.<ref name=Honorton>{{cite journal |last=Bem |first=Daryl J. |authorlink= |coauthors=Honorton, Charles |title=Does psi exist? Replicable evidence for an anomalous process of information transfer |journal=Psychological Bulletin  |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=4-18 |date=1995 |url=http://www.dbem.ws/Does%20Psi%20Exist%3F.pdf |accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref>

====Remote viewing====

{{main| Remote viewing}}

Remote viewing experiments test the ability to gather information on a remote target consisting of an object, place, or person, etc., that is hidden from the physical perception of the viewer and typically separated from the viewer at some distance. In one type of remote viewing experiment, a pool of several hundred photographs are created. One of these is randomly selected by a third party to be the target.  It is then set aside in a remote location. The remote viewer attempts to sketch or otherwise describe that remote target photo. This procedure is repeated for a number of different targets. Many ways of analytically evaluating the results of this sort of experiment have been developed. One common method is to take the group of seven target photos and responses, randomly shuffle the targets and responses, and then ask independent judges to rank order or match the correct targets with the participant's actual responses. This method assumes that if there were an anomalous transfer of information, the responses should correspond more closely to the correct targets than to the mismatched targets.<ref name="Dunne"/>

Several hundred such trials have been conducted by investigators over the past 25 years, including by the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Laboratory (PEAR) and by scientists at [[SRI International|  SRI International and Science Applications International Corp.]], under contract by the [[U.S. government]]. The cumulative data was interpreted by researchers [[Robert G. Jahn]] and Brenda Dunne at PEAR as indicating that information about remote photos, actual scenes, and events can be perceived beyond chance expectation.<ref name=Dunne>{{cite journal |last=Dunne |first=Brenda |authorlink= |coauthors=Jahn, Robert G. |title=Does psi exist?

====Psychokinesis on random number generators====
{{main| Psychokinesis}}

The advent of powerful and inexpensive electronic and computer technologies has allowed the development of fully automated experiments studying possible interactions between [[mind and matter]]. In the most common experiment of this type, a [[Random Number Generator]] (RNG), based on electronic or [[radioactive]] noise, produces a data stream that is recorded and analyzed by computer [[software]]. A subject attempts to mentally alter the distribution of the random numbers, usually in an experimental design that is functionally equivalent to getting more "heads" than "tails" while flipping a coin. In the RNG experiment, design flexibility can be combined with rigorous controls, while collecting a large amount of data in very short period of time. This technique has been used both to test individuals for psychokinesis and to test the possible influence on RNGs of large groups of people.<ref name=Dunne85>{{cite journal |last=Dunne |first=Brenda J. |authorlink= |coauthors=Jahn, Robert G. |title=On the quantum mechanics of consciousness, with application to anomalous phenomena |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=721-772 |date=1985 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/vtrr87tg356154r7/ |doi=10.1007/BF00735378 |issn=0015-9018 (Print) 1572-9516 (Online)|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref>

Major meta-analyses of the RNG database have been published every few years since appearing in the journal ''[[Foundations of Physics]]'' in 1986.<ref name="Dunne85"/> Researchers [[Robert G. Jahn]] and Brenda Dunne at PEAR say that the effect size in all cases was found to be very small, but consistent across time and experimental designs, resulting in an overall [[statistical significance]].  The most recent [[meta-analysis]] was published in ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]'', along with several critical commentaries .<ref name="pmid16822162">{{cite journal |author=Bösch H, Steinkamp F, Boller E |title=Examining psychokinesis: the interaction of human intention with random number generators--a meta-analysis |journal=Psychological bulletin |volume=132 |issue=4 |pages=497-523 |year=2006 |pmid=16822162 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.132.4.497}}</ref><ref name="pmid16822164">{{cite journal |author=Radin D, Nelson R, Dobyns Y, Houtkooper J |title=Reexamining psychokinesis: comment on Bösch, Steinkamp, and Boller |journal=Psychological bulletin |volume=132 |issue=4 |pages=529-32; discussion 533-7 |year=2006 |pmid=16822164 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.132.4.529 |issn=}}</ref>  The meta-analysis was comprised of 380 studies, which some researchers say has produced an overall effect size that was very small but statistically significant.

====Direct mental influence on living systems====
This experimental domain was previously called "bio-PK." More recently, researchers refer to it as 'direct mental interactions with living systems' (DMILS). It studies the effects of one person's intentions on a distant person's [[psychophysiological]] state. One type of DMILS experiment looks at the commonly reported "feeling of being stared at." The "starer" and the "staree" are isolated in different locations, and the starer is periodically asked to simply gaze at the staree via closed circuit video links. Meanwhile the staree's nervous system activity is automatically and continuously monitored. 

Parapsychologists have interpreted the cumulative data on this and similar DMILS experiments to suggest that one person's attention directed towards a remote, isolated person, can significantly activate or calm that person's [[nervous system]]. In a meta-analysis of these experiments published in the ''British Journal of Psychology'' in 2004, researchers found that overall there was a small, but significant DMILS effect.  However, the study also found that when a small number of the highest quality studies from one laboratory were analyzed, the effect size was not significant. The authors concluded that although the existence of some anomaly related to distant intentions cannot be ruled out, there was also a shortage of independent replications and theoretical concepts.<ref name="pmid15142304">{{cite journal |author=Schmidt S, Schneider R, Utts J, Walach H |title=Distant intentionality and the feeling of being stared at: two meta-analyses |journal=British journal of psychology (London, England : 1953) |volume=95 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=235-47 |year=2004 |pmid=15142304 |doi=10.1348/000712604773952449 |issn=}}</ref>

===Near death experiences===
{{main| Near-death experience}}

A [[near-death experience]] (NDE) is an experience reported by a person who nearly died, or who experienced [[clinical death]] and then revived.  NDEs include one or more of the following experiences: A sense of being dead; an [[out-of-body experience]]; a sensation of floating above one's body and seeing the surrounding area; a sense of overwhelming love and peace; a sensation of moving upwards through a tunnel or narrow passageway; meeting deceased relatives or spiritual figures; encountering a being of light, or a light; experiencing a [[life review]]; reaching a border or boundary; and a feeling of being returned to the body, often accompanied by reluctance.<ref name=Mauro>{{cite web |last=Mauro |first=James |authorlink= |title=Bright lights, big mystery |work=Psychology Today |date=1992 |url=http://psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19920701-000030.html |accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref>

Interest in the NDE was originally spurred by the research of [[Elisabeth Kübler-Ross]], George Ritchie, and [[Raymond Moody| Raymond Moody Jr]]. In 1998, Moody was appointed chair in "consciousness studies" at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]].  The [[International Association for Near-death Studies]] (IANDS) was founded in 1978, in order to meet the needs of early researchers and experiencers within this field of research.  Later researchers, such as Bruce Greyson, [[Kenneth Ring]] and Michael Sabom, introduced the study of Near-death experiences to the academic setting.<ref name="Mauro"/>

===Anomalous Psychology ===
A number of studies conducted in the [[Americas| American]], [[European]], and [[Australasian]] continents have found that a majority of people surveyed report having had experiences that could be interpreted as telepathy, [[precognition]], and similar phenomena. Variables than have been associated with reports of psi-phenomena include belief in the reality of psi, the tendency to have [[hypnotic]], [[dissociative]], and other alterations of consciousness, and, less reliably so, [[neuroticism]], [[extraversion]], and openness to experience. Although psi-related experiences can occur in the context of such psychopathologies as schizotypal personality, dissociative, and other disorders, most individuals who endorse a belief in psi are well-adjusted, lack serious [[pathology]], and are not intellectually deficient or lacking critical abilities.<ref name="cardenza"/>

==Criticism==
[[Image:Paraghost.gif| thumb| right| 165px| Fabricated images of [[ghosts]] such as this were very popular in the 19th century.]]Critics of parapsychology begin with the assertion that extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence. Proponents of hypotheses that contradict centuries of scientific research must provide extraordinary evidence if their hypotheses are to be taken seriously.<ref name=Gracely>{{cite web |last=Gracely, Ph.D. |first=Ed J. |authorlink= |title=Why Extraordinary Claims Demand Extraordinary Proof |work=PhACT |date=1998 |url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/extraproof.html
|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> Many skeptics of parapsychology hold that the entire body of evidence to date is of poor quality and not properly controlled; in their view, the entire field of parapsychology has produced no conclusive results whatsoever. They often cite instances of fraud, flawed or potentially flawed studies, a [[Magical thinking|psychological need for mysticism]], and [[cognitive bias]] as ways to explain parapsychological results.<ref>((cite book |last=Myers |first=David G |title=Psychology |edition=8th |date=2006 |publisher=Worth Publishers, Inc |isbn=0716764288}}</ref> Some skeptics also contend that people's desire to believe in paranormal phenomena is often stronger than all the evidence that it does not exist.<ref>{{cite web |last=My  |first=David G |authorlink= |coauthors=Blackmore, Susan |title=Putting ESP to the Experimental Test |work=Hope College |url=http://www.davidmyers.org/Brix?pageID=61&article_part=4 |accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref>

The reality of parapsychological phenomena and the scientific validity of parapsychological research is a matter of continued criticism. The methods of parapsychologists are regarded by some critics as a [[pseudoscience]].<ref name=Beyerstein>{{cite web |last=Beyerstein |first=Barry L. |authorlink= |title=Distinguishing Science from Pseudoscience |work=Simon Fraser University |date=1995 |url=http://www.sfu.ca/~beyerste/research/articles/02SciencevsPseudoscience.pdf
|format=PDF |accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> Some of the more specific criticisms state that parapsychology does not have a clearly defined subject matter, an easily repeatable experiment that can demonstrate a psi effect on demand, nor an underlying theory to explain the paranormal transfer of information.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hyman |first=Ray |authorlink= |title=Evaluation of Program on Anomalous Mental Phenomena |work=mceagle.com |date=1995 |url=http://www.mceagle.com/remote-viewing/refs/science/air/hyman.html |accessdatr=2007-07-31}}</ref>  James E. Alcock, professor of [[Psychology]] at [[York University]], said that few of parapsychology's experimental results have prompted interdisciplinary research with more mainstream sciences such as [[physics]] or [[biology]].  Alcock states that parapsychology remains an isolated science to such an extent that its very legitimacy is questionable.<ref name=Alcock81>{{cite book |last=Alcock |first=J.

===Fraud===
[[Image:James_Randi_crop.jpg| thumb| left| 200px| [[James Randi]] is a well-known critic of parapsychology and feels that [[Magic (illusion)|magic tricks]] can account for what appears to be psychic phenomena.]]

There have been instances of [[fraud]] in the history of parapsychology research. The Soal-Goldney experiments of 1941-43 (suggesting precognitive ability in subjects) were long regarded as some of the best in the field because they relied upon independent checking and witnesses to prevent fraud. However, many years later, suspicions of fraud were apparently confirmed when statistical evidence, uncovered and published by other parapsychologists in the field, suggested that Dr. Soal had cheated by altering the raw data.<ref name=Haskell>
{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=C |authorlink= |coauthors=Haskell, P |title="Normal" Explanation of the Soal-Goldney Experiments in Extrasensory Perception |journal=Nature |volume=245 |issue=5419 |pages=52-54 |date=1973 |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1973Natur.245...52S |doi=10.1038/245052a0 |accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref><ref name=Alcock81/><ref name=Marwick>{{cite journal |last=Markwick |first=B |authorlink= |coauthors=Haskell, P. |title=The Soal-Goldney experiments with Basil Shackleton: new evidence of data manipulation |journal=Proc Soc Psychical Res |volume=56 |pages=250-277 |date=1978}}</ref> 

Walter J. Levy, an experimenter at the FRNM, reported on a series of successful ESP experiments involving computer-controlled manipulation of non-human subjects, including eggs and rats. His experiments showed very high positive results. Because the subjects were non-human, and because the experimental environment was mostly automated, his successful experiments avoided criticism concerning experimenter effects, and removed the question of the subject's belief as an influence on the outcome. However, Levy's fellow researchers became suspicious about his methods. They found that Levy interfered with data-recording equipment, manually creating fraudulent strings of positive results. Rhine fired Levy and reported the fraud in a number of articles.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rhine, J.B |title=A new case of experimenter unreliability |journal=Journal of Parapsychology |volume=38 |pages=137-153 |year=1974}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bauer, E |title=Criticism and Controversy in Parapsychology – An Overview |journal=European Journal of Parapsychology |volume=5 |pages=141-166 |year=1984 |url=http://www.psy.gu.se/EJP/EJP1984Bauer.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref>

Fraud undoubtedly played a part in creating the positive reputations of [[Spiritualist]] [[Mediumship| mediums]] who were often caught in the act of duplicity. In the 1920s, [[magician]] and escapologist [[Harry Houdini]] said that researchers and observers could not create experimental procedures which absolutely preclude fraud.<ref name=Houdini>{{cite book |last=Houdini |first=Harry |authorlink= |title=A Magician Among the Spirits |publisher=Arno Press |date=1987 |pages= |url= |doi=}}</ref> In 1979, magician and [[debunker]] [[James Randi]] perpetrated a hoax, now famously referred to as [[Project Alpha]]. Randi trained two young magicians and sent them under cover to [[Washington University]]'s McDonnell Laboratory with the specific aim of exposing poor experimental methods and credulity thought to be common in parapsychology. Although no formal statements or publications from the McDonnell laboratory supported the likelihood that the effects demonstrated by the two magicians were genuine, both of Randi's trainees reportedly deceived experimenters over a period of four years with demonstrations of supposedly [[Spoon bending| telekenetic metal bending]].<ref name=randi83>Randi, J. (1983). The Project Alpha experiment: Part one: the first two years.  ''Skeptical Inquirer'', Summer issue.</ref> Such methodological failures have been cited as evidence that most, if not all, extraordinary results in parapsychology derive from error or fraud.

===Criticism of experimental results===

Although some critics feel that parapsychological study is [[scientific]], they are not satisfied with its experimental results.<ref name=Alcock03>
{{cite journal |last=Alcock |first=James E. |authorlink= |coauthors=Jahn, Robert G. |title=Give the Null Hypothesis a Chance |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=10  |issue=6-7 |pages=29–50 |date=2003 |url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/pdf/Alcock-editorial.pdf |accessdate=2007-07-30}}</ref><ref name=Hyman>{{cite journal |last=Hyman |first=Ray |title=Evaluation of the program on anomalous mental phenomena |journal=The Journal of Parapsychology |volume=59 |issue=1 |date=1995 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2320/is_n4_v59/ai_18445600 |accessdate=2007-07-30}}</ref>  Critics contend that apparently successful experimental results in psi research are more likely due to sloppy procedures, poorly trained researchers, or methodological flaws than to genuine psi effects.<ref name=Akers>{{cite paper |author=C. Akers |title=Methodological Criticisms of Parapsychology, Advances in Parapsychological Research 4 |publisher=PesquisaPSI |date=1986 |url=http://www.pesquisapsi.com/books/advances4/7_Methodological_Criticisms.html

Utts has stated that these experiments suffered numerous problems with regard to randomization, statistical baselines and the application of statistical models, and that the significance values quoted in the experiments were meaningless due to defects in experimental and statistical procedures of the studies.<ref> {{cite journal|title=CRITIQUE OF THE PEAR REMOTE-VIEWING EXPERIMENTS|journal=Journal of Parapsychology|date=1992-06|first=George P.|last=Hansen|coauthors=Jessica Utts, Betty Markwick|volume=56|issue=2|pages=97-113. |id= |url=http://www.tricksterbook.com/ArticlesOnline/PEARCritique.htm|format=|accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref>

Because [[psi]] is a negatively defined concept, a typical measure of the evidence for such phenomena in parapsychological experiments is statistical deviation from chance expectation. However, critics point out that any statistical deviation from chance is, strictly speaking, only evidence of a statistical anomaly, or that some unknown variable was causing the deviation from chance. Ray Hyman contends that even if experiments could be made to reproduce the findings of certain parapsychological studies under specificed conditions, this would be a far cry from concluding that psychic functioning has been demonstrated.<ref name=Hyman33>{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/9603/claims.html |title=The Evidence for Psychic Functioning: Claims vs. Reality |accessdate=2007-07-02 |last=Hyman |first=Ray |date=1996 |publisher=[[CSICOP]]}}</ref> It has also been stated that assuming psi exists is [[affirming the consequent]] or [[begging the question]]. Reasoning that if a person is psychic, then that individual will do better than chance in experiments and since that person does better than chance then therefore that person must be psychic would be considered the fallacy of affirming the consequent.<ref name= Carrol>{{cite web |last=Carroll |first=Robert Todd |authorlink= |title=psi assumption |work=Skepdic.com |publisher=The Skeptics Dictionary |date=2005 |url=http://www.skepdic.com/psiassumption.html |accessdate=2007-07-30}}</ref>

===Selection bias and meta-analysis===
[[Selection bias| Selective reporting]] has been offered by critics as an explanation for the positive results reported by parapsychologists. Selective reporting is sometimes referred to as a "file drawer" problem, which arises when only positive study results are made public, while studies with negative or null results are not made public.<ref name="pmid16822164"/> Selective reporting has a compounded effect on [[meta-analysis]], which is a statistical technique that aggregates the results of many studies in order to generate sufficient statistical [[power (statistics)|power]] to demonstrate a result that the individual studies themselves couldn't demonstrate at a [[statistical significance|statistically significant]] level. For example, a recent [[meta-analysis]] combined 380 studies on [[psychokinesis]],<ref name="pmid16822162"/> including data from the [[Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab| PEAR lab]]. It concluded that, although there is a statistically significant overall effect, it is not consistent and relatively few negative studies would cancel it out. Consequently, [[Publication bias | biased publication]] of positive results could be the cause.<ref name="Smee"/>

The popularity of meta-analysis in parapsychology has been criticized by numerous researchers, and is often seen as troublesome even within parapsychology itself.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Replication and Meta-Analysis in Parapsychology |journal=Statistical Science |date=1991 |first=Jessica |last=Utts |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=363-403 |url=http://anson.ucdavis.edu/~utts/91rmp.html |accessdate=2007-07-30}}</ref> Critics have said that parapsychologists misuse meta-analysis to create the incorrect impression that statistically significant results have been obtained which indicate the existence psi phenomena.<ref name=Stenger>{{cite web |last=Stenger |first=Victor J. |authorlink= |title=Meta-Analysis and the Filedrawer Effect |work=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |date=2002 |url=http://www.csicop.org/sb/2002-12/reality-check.html |accessdate=2007-07-30}}</ref>  

Critics also contend that the practice of meta-analysis is post hoc.  The evaluation of the metholological quality of a study, after it is done and the results are known, can create opportunity for biases to affect the analyses.  Various strategies, methods and criteria can be selected, which provide an opportunity for selecting outcomes that are consistent with the expectations of the analyst.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A Proposal and Challenge for Proponents and Skeptics of Psi |journal=Journal of Parapsychology |date=2005 |first=J.E. |last=Kennedy |volume=68 |pages=157-167 |url=http://jeksite.org/psi/jp04.htm |accessdate=2007-07-29}}</ref> It is not uncommon to find that two or more meta-analyses done at about the same time by investigators with the same access to the literature reach incompatible or even contradictory conclusions.<ref>Bailar, J.C. (1997). "The promise and problems of meta-analysis", ''New England Journal of Medicine'', 337, 559-561, cited in Kennedy, 2004, JoP 68</ref>
