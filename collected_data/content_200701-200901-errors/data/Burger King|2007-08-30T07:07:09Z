'''Burger King''' ({{NYSE|BKC}}), often abbreviated to '''BK''', is the second largest [[chain store|chain]] of [[hamburger]] [[fast food]] restaurants in the world behind industry bellwether [[McDonald's]] and the third largest chain overall after McDonald's and [[Yum! Brands]]. Founded in 1954 in [[Miami, Florida]], its current headquarters are located in a suburban Miami area that is part of an [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated]] section of [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]]. Beginning in 1959, BK began expanding its market by using a [[franchise]] model to drive its expansion plans. Since that time, the company has grown to just over 11,000 stores in 65 nations around the globe<ref name="BKFacts">{{cite web |url=http://www.bk.com/companyinfo/corporation/facts.aspx |title=Burger King Domestic and Global facts |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>. One of its largest franchisees is '''Hungry Jack's''', which owns, operates and sub-licenses over 300 restaurants in [[Australia]].

When the company first started, its [[Burger King products|menu]] consisted predominantly of [[hamburger]]s, [[french fries]], [[soft drink]]s, and [[dessert]]s; since that time it has expanded the breadth of its menu by adding various non-beef items like [[chicken]], fish and veggie [[sandwiches]]; a breakfast menu; [[salads]] and non-soft drink beverages such as [[Icee]]s. Its [[Burger King advertising|advertising]] has generated a memorable jingle, several well known and parodied [[slogans]] and a successful [[Internet meme]] centered around its mascot, [[the Burger King]].

Additionally, over the past several years BK has been cited as contributing to the western [[obesity]] epidemic by introducing products that contain large amounts of [[fat]], [[trans-fat]] and calories. Like many of its competitors, BK has also been targeted by various animal welfare groups, such as [[PETA]], over the treatment of the animals it uses in the production its products.

===History===
[[Image:Burgerkingrestaurant.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Burger King restaurant in [[Redwood City, California]]]]

Burger King's first restaurant, originally called '''Insta Burger King''', was opened on [[December 4]], [[1954]] in a suburb of [[Miami, Florida]], [[United States|USA]] by [[James McLamore]] and [[David Edgerton]], who were both alumni of the [[Cornell University School of Hotel Administration]]. McLamore had visited the hamburger stand belonging to [[Dick and Mac McDonald]] in [[San Bernardino, California]]; being able to sense potential in their innovative [[assembly line]]-based production system, he decided to create a version of his own. By 1959, BK had grown to five regional stores in and around the metropolitan Miami area. About this time, Messrs McLamore and Edgerton decided to expand BK nationally by using a franchising system that had become a popular method for expansion due to its low capital cost for the parent company. They formed Burger King Corporation as the parent and began selling territorial franchise licenses to private owners across the US.<ref name="answers">[http://www.answers.com/topic/burger-king History of Burger King Corporation] Answers.com</ref>

In [[1967]], after eight years of private operation, the [[Pillsbury Company]] acquired Burger King and its parent company Burger King Corporation. At the time of the purchase, BK had grown to 274 different restaurants in the United States. While BK began its foray in to locations outside of the [[continental United States]] in 1963 with a store in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], it did not have a large international presence. This situation changed shortly after the acquisition when Pillsbury began BK's global expansion with its first international restaurant in [[Canada]] in [[1969]]. Other international locations followed soon after: [[Oceania]] in [[1971]] with Hungry Jack's and the first [[European]] restaurant located in [[Madrid, Spain]], in [[1975]]. Beginning in [[1982]], BK and its franchisees began operating stores in several [[East Asian]] countries, including [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]] and [[Korea]]<ref name="answers"/>. Due to high competition, many of the Japanese locations closed by the end of 2001. BK reentered the Japanese market in mid-2007<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qsrmagazine.com/articles/news/story.phtml?id=5523 |title=Burger King back in Japan after 6 years |author=Yuri Kageyama |publisher=QSR Magazine |date=2007-06-08 |accessdate=2007-08-25}}</ref>. BKs [[Central American|Central]] and [[South American]] operation started in [[Mexico]] in [[date]].<ref name="answers"/>

Since the time that Pillsbury bought Burger King, BK has been the object of a series of failed and successful acquisitions and divestitures. In 1973, Chart House, at over 350 restaurants and one of BK's largest franchise groups, attempted to purchase the chain from Pillsbury for $100 million ([[USD]]). When Chart House's bid failed, its owners, Billy and Jimmy Trotter, suggested that Pillsbury and Chart House spin off their respective Burger King holdings and merge the two entities into a separate company; an offer Pillsbury also declined. After the failed attempts to acquire BK, the relationship between Chart House and the Trotters began to sour; in 1979 BK successfully sued Chart House for improperly acquiring locations in Boston and Houston<ref name="answers"/>. In [[1984]], Pillsbury purchased Chart House's successor, DiversiFoods, for $390 million ([[USD]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_v19/ai_3930610 |title=How Pillsbury 'stole' DiversiFoods for just $390 million |author=Rick Telberg |publisher=Nation's Restaurant News |date=1985-09-09 |accessdate=2007-08-24}}</ref> after a separate,  independent $525 million management-backed leveraged buy-out of the company failed<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02EFDA1238F931A25751C1A962948260 |title=DiversiFoods Net |publisher=New York Times |date=1984-12-12 |accessdate=2007-08-24}}</ref>.

BK, and former corporate siblings, [[Bennigan's]], [[Steak and Ale]], [[Godfather's Pizza]] (part of the DiversiFoods acquisition<ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_v18/ai_3367413 |title=Hyde leaves DiversiFoods-BK; Bolton takes reins as president |author=David Zuckerman |publisher=Nation's Restaurant News |date=1984-07-24 |accessdate=2007-08-24}}</ref>), [[Quick Wok]] and [[Häagen Dazs]] ice cream shops, remained under the Pillsbury corporate umbrella until Pillsbury divested its restaurant holdings in [[1989]] and sold Burger King to [[United Kingdom|British]] [[alcoholic beverage]] manufacturer and distributer [[Grand Metropolitan]] PLC. In [[1989]], under the ownership of Grand Met, Burger King acquired many locations of its major [[UK]] rival [[Wimpy Bar|Wimpy]] when the parent company bought the Wimpy's brand from its previous owner [[United Biscuits]] and re-branded them as Burger King, giving it an even greater presence in that country. While other "Wimpy" locations are still in operation presently, they are now independent from BK and no longer have the presence they once did<ref name="answers"/>. In [[1997]], Grand Metropolitan merged with [[Guinness]] to form a company called [[Diageo]]. Diageo maintained ownership of BKC until [[2001]] when Diageo decided to focus solely on their beverage products and put BK up for sale.

In [[2002]], a [[triumvirate|troika]] of [[private equity]] firms led by [[Texas Pacific Group]] with associates [[Bain Capital]] and [[Goldman Sachs Capital Partners]] agreed to purchase BK from Diageo for $1.5 billion ([[USD]]),<ref name="answers"/> with the sale becoming complete in December of that year<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1113/p01s01-usec.html|title=Are private buyouts good for the economy?|author=By Mark Trumbull|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|date=[[13 November]] [[2006]]}}</ref>. The new owners, through several new CEOs, have moved to revitalize and reorganize the company, the first major move was to re-name the BK parent as Burger King Brands. Although the investment group initially planned to take BK public within the two years of the acquisition, this was delayed until 2006. On [[February 1]], [[2006]], CEO [[Greg Brenneman]] announced TPG's plans to turn Burger King into a publicly traded company by issuing an [[Initial public offering|Initial Public Offering]]. On February 16, the company announced it had filed its registration for the IPO with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. On [[May 18]], [[2006]], Burger King began trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] under the ticker symbol BKC.

The TPGroup has continued BK's international expansion by announcing plans to open new franchised locations in [[Eastern Europe]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://investor.bk.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=87140&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=972760&highlight= |title=The BURGER KING Brand Enters Poland |author=Burger King press release |date=2007-03-17 |accessdate=2007-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&story_id=17516 |title=Burger King Mulls Franchises |author=Maria Levitov |publisher=the St. Petersburg Times |date=2006-05-05 |accessdate=2007-08-25}}</ref>, 180 stores in the [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ameinfo.com/40791.html |title=Burger King increases number of restaurants in UAE |publisher=AMEInfo.com |date=2007-03-29 |accessdate=2007-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2007_March_29/ai_n18766980 |title=Burger King® To Expand in Egypt |publisher=Business Wire on Find Article.com |date=2007-03-29 |accessdate=2007-08-25}}</ref>, [[Brazil]], and over 250 stores in new Asian territories such as [[Macao]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]] by the end of 2012<ref>{{cite web |url=http://franchise.business-opportunities.biz/2007/06/07/burger-king-may-add-250-asia-stores-within-five-years/ |title=Burger King May Add 250 Asia Stores Within Five Years |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2007-06-07 |accessdate=2007-08-25}}</ref>.

===Trademark disputes===
As it expanded in the United States, Burger King found that smaller operations had previously been using the name. One such restaurant in [[Mattoon, Illinois]] negotiated a settlement that forbids the chain from opening locations within 20 miles (32 km). See [[Burger King (Mattoon, Illinois)]].

In a trademark settlement with San Antonio local chain Whopper Burger, Burger King was not allowed to open locations within two counties of the city. The chain was ultimately bought out in the mid 1980s, opening the way for San Antonio Burger King locations.

A trademark conflict also arose in Australia; see [[Burger King#HungryJacks|Hungry Jack's]], below.

Burger King Holdings is the parent company of Burger King, in the [[US]] it operates under the Burger King Brands title while internationally it operates under the Burger King Corporation banner. It is a publicly traded company with investment firms of Texas Pacific Group, Bain Capital, and Goldman Sachs each owning about 25% of the company.<ref name="2006report">[http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/87/87140/BKCAR2006.pdf BKC 2006 Annual Report]</ref>

Historically, Burger King has been the second largest burger chain in North America, behind [[McDonald's]]. However, Burger King's revenues and market share have been declining. In the early 2000s, Burger King fell to a near tie for second place with [[Wendy's]]. Burger King has been closing under-performing stores and changing its marketing strategy in an attempt to turn its fortunes around. In fiscal year 2002, the firm had [[United States dollar|US $]]11.3 billion in total sales.<ref name="2006report"/>

As of 2006, there are more than 11,220 Burger King outlets in 61 countries. 66% of the restaurants are in the United States. The company has more than 340,000 employees who serve approximately 11.4 million customers daily.<ref name="2006report"/>

Almost 90% of Burger King restaurants are privately owned and operated, or [[franchising|franchised]]. While Burger King Corporation sets standards for exterior store appearance, food quality and menu, individual owners have control over hours of operations, interior decor, pricing and staff uniforms and wages. For example, [[Magic Johnson]]'s company [[Magic Johnson Enterprises]] purchased 30 Burger King stores on [[June 7]], [[2004]]. The stores were redecorated with a sports memorabilia theme. These locations officially reopened on [[December 3]], [[2004]].<ref name="2006report"/>

Burger King has a longstanding presence at [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] installations worldwide, dating back to the 1980s under a contract with [[Army and Air Force Exchange Service]]. Today, while other chains such as [[Taco Bell]], [[Popeye's]] and [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] have a presence on military bases, virtually every major Army and Air Force installation hosts a BK restaurant. 
Many Burger King outlets, even inside cities, require customers to operate a motor vehicle to purchase food during late evening hours.<ref name="2006report"/>

Burger King is one of the few companies that does not accept communication via email.

==Hungry Jack's profile==
[[Image:Hungry Jacks Logo.png|200px|right]]
When Burger King decided to expand its operations into [[Australia]], it found that its business name was already [[trademark]]ed by a man running a small takeaway food shop. As a result, Burger King provided the Australian franchisee, [[Jack Cowin]], with a list of possible alternative names that the Australian Burger King restaurants could be branded as. The names were derived from pre-existing trademarks already registered by Burger King and [[Pillsbury]] (at that time, the parent company of Burger King). Cowin selected the branding '''Hungry Jack's''', echoing his name and sentiment. '[[Hungry Jack]]' - without the 'apostrophe S' - was actually a Pillsbury brand, being used in the US to market [[pancake]] (flapjack) mixture. Accordingly, the first Australian franchise of the Burger King Corporation, established in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in 1971, was branded as Hungry Jack's. 

In 1986, Hungry Jack's purchased 11 failing Australian [[Wendy's|Wendy's Hamburgers]] locations and rebranded them under the Hungry Jack's name.

===1996 to 2001: Legal Proceedings===

When the existing registered trademark in Australia for Burger King lapsed in 1996, the American parent company wanted [[Jack Cowin|Cowin]] to change the Hungry Jack's outlets over to the Burger King name. Cowin resisted the change but despite his opposition, Burger King proceeded to open more than seventy outlets in [[Australia]] under the Burger King name between 1996 and 2003. These were built upon existing franchise locations at international airports &ndash; the international territory apparently outside the Cowin licensing deal. In some cases, the new Burger King outlets were located very close to existing Hungry Jack's. As a result of Burger King's actions, Hungry Jacks Pty. Ltd. began legal proceedings in [[Australia]] against the Burger King Corporation citing violation of the master franchising agreement.

In 2001, the case was finally resolved in favour of Hungry Jack's in a case that eventually included the Australian operating arm of [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. As a result, the Burger King Corporation was ordered to pay $AUD 75 million to Hungry Jack's for breach of its franchise agreement.<ref>{{Cite Case AU|NSWCA|187|2001}}</ref> One final attempt was made by Burger King to appeal the decision to the [[High Court of Australia]]<ref>{{Cite Case AU|hcatranscripts|S157|1|2001}}</ref>; however, this appeal was dismissed.

=== 2002 to the present day ===

In 2002, Burger King Australia exited the country and sold a 51% share of its Australian restaurants to TPF, the company that operates Burger King in New Zealand. In an attempt to improve rapidly falling sales, TPF re-branded its Burger King restaurants as Hungry Jack's in late 2003 believing that the Hungry Jack's name with its 30 year history was the stronger brand. A market research survey conducted six months after the re-branding showed that Burger King had been the preferred brand, and that the words most often chosen by respondents in the survey to describe Hungry Jack's were "slow" and "dated"{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. 

In mid 2005, TPF decided to exit the Australian market and sold its 51% share of the former Burger King sites to Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd, the company operated by Jack Cowin.<ref>[http://southflorida.bizjournals.com/southflorida/stories/2003/05/26/daily36.html In Australia, Burger King to become 'Hungry Jack's'] South Florida Business Journal, [[30 May]] [[2003]]</ref>

=== Operational nuances ===

[[Image:Hungry Jack's slogan.png|frame|right|The [[slogan]] "The burgers are better at Hungry Jack's" is well known in [[Australia]].]]While Burger King's logo has since changed to the "blue crescent" design, the Hungry Jack's logo is still based on the previous Burger King logo, employing the simpler bun-and-filling motif.

Hungry Jack's sells the usual range of burgers but also offers an Australian speciality: the Aussie Burger. This burger is based on the traditional Australian [[fish and chips]] shop favourite, including fried egg, bacon, onion, and [[beetroot]], with the traditional meat, lettuce, and tomato. Hungry Jack's locations are required to follow any menu changes made by Burger King.

Hungry Jack's breakfast menu, introduced in late 2005 in three states ([[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]], and [[Northern Territory]]) and the other states on [[October 31]] [[2006]], bears little resemblance to Burger King's US breakfast menu. The main breakfast sandwich is served on either an [[English muffin]], [[baguette]] roll or as a wrap ([[breakfast burrito]]) instead of a [[croissant]]; the [[hash browns]] are served as patties as opposed to [[Tater Tots]] and they feature [[pancakes]].<ref name="hj menu">{{cite web |url=http://www.hungryjacks.com.au/Menu.aspx |title=Hungry Jack's menu |accessdate=2000-08-26}}</ref><ref name="bk menu">{{cite web |url=http://www.bk.com/#menu=2,-1,-1 |title=Burger King's US menu |accessdate=2007-08-29}}</ref>

The only trademarked sandwich products that HJ sells is the [[Whopper]] and the [[Ocean Catch]] sandwich. All other products go by a generic naming such as hamburger or chicken nuggets.<ref name="hj menu"/><ref name="bk menu"/>

Hungry Jack's retains strong links with Perth, with the city's first team in the [[Australian Football League]], the [[West Coast Eagles]], having been sponsored by Hungry Jack's since their entry into the league in 1987.

Hungry Jack's Kids Club mascots are unique to the Australian franchisee, as opposed to other international locations that use one the two existing kid's mascots, [[Burger King advertising#Kids Club|the Burger King Kids' Club]] or [[Burger King advertising#Honbatz|the Honbatz]]. HJ does have a Kid's Club program similar to the US offering, offering themed birthday parties at its restaurants along with its Kid's Club Meals. One other noticeable difference between the HJ and BK children's programs is the placement of the [[apostrophe#Possessive apostrophe|apostrophe]] in the name: HJ places it before the "[[s]]" while BK places it after.

Hungry Jack's in Australia has trademarked the new slogan, 'Oh Yeah', which was featured in commercials that ran late 2005/early 2006. Other changes at Hungry Jack's include new fresh salads and deli-style baguettes.

Many Hungry Jack's restaurant locations are designed around a 1950s/1960s styled theme. Background music from this era may be played within the restaurant (occasionally through a '50s era styled Jukebox) with associated contemporary pictures and memorabilia utilized as part of the interior decor. In the larger sit-down style restaurants, the seats and tables are laid out in a 1950s [[diner]] style.

==Products==
{{main|Burger King products}}

As part of its reorganization, BK introduced several new products to its menu, including several new or revamped chicken products, a new salad line and its BK Joe brand of coffee. Some of the new products, including its [[Enormous Omelet Sandwich]] line<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2005-03-27-burger-king_x.htm | title=Burger King to offer whopper of a breakfast sandwich |author=Bruce Horovitz |publisher=USA TODAY |date=[[28 March]] [[2005]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/blogs/healthbeat/archive.asp?postID=761 |title=Word of the day: Meat'Normous |publisher=the Spokesman Review ([[Spokane, WA]]) |date=[[26 September]] [[2005]]}}</ref> and the [[BK Stacker]] line<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.komoradio.com/news/archive/4191016.html |title=Burger King Launches Line Of Jumbo High-Rise Burgers |author=Herb Weisbaum |publisher=KOMO Radio ([[Seattle, WA]]) |date=[[6 July]] [[2006]]}}</ref>, brought negative attention due the large portion size, amounts of unhealthy fats and trans-fats.

==Advertising==
{{Main|Burger King advertising}}

In [[January 2003]], BK hired the [[Miami]]-based advertising firm of [[Crispin Porter and Bogusky|Crispin Porter + Bogusky]] (CP+B) to resuscitate the moribund advertising account of BK<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/news/newsbyid.asp?id=14482 |title=Burger King Corporation Selects Crispin Porter + Bogusky As Lead Creative Advertising Agency|publisher=HispanicBusiness.com| date=[[23 January]] [[2006]]}}</ref>.

</gallery>

The famous Burger King "bun halves" logo made its debut in 1969 and endured well into the 1990s. As its name implies, it was meant to resemble a [[hamburger]]: the logo had two orange semi-circular "buns" surrounding the name, which was the "meat" of the logo. In 1994 BK updated the logo with a graphical tightening, replacing the aging "bulging" font with a smoother font with rounded edges. In addition, all secondary signing, such as roof and directional signs, was also updated with new rounded font.

In 1999, BK again revised its logo. The new Burger King logo is a stylized version of the original "bun halves" logo. BK changed the color of the restaurant's name from orange to red lettering, while leaving them sandwiched between two yellow bun halves. The new logo also tilts the bun halves and the [[font]] on an [[Coordinate axis|axis]], has a smaller "bun" motif and wraps the burger with a blue crescent whipping around the buns giving it a more [[circular]] appearance. Most restaurants did not acquire newer signs with the new logo, menus, and drive-thru ordering speakers until 2001. Again all secondary signage was updated with the new logo and type face, and all sign posts were repainted to match the blue coloring of the new crescent from their original black.<ref>[http://bizjournals.bison.com/press/pr4-14bk.html Burger King Shares Extensive Transformation Plans] press release on BizJornals on Bison.com</ref>

The Hungry Jack's logo is based on the original Burger King "bun halves" design, and has been used since Hungry Jack's founding in 1971. HJ currently uses an updated version of the "bun halves" logo, featuring the smoother font used in revised Burger King logo from 1994.
