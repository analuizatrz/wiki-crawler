A '''diaper''' (in North America) or '''nappy''' (in Britain, many Commonwealth countries and Ireland) is an absorbent [[garment]] worn by individuals who are [[urinary incontinence|incontinent]], that is, lack control over bladder or bowel movements, or who are unable to reach the [[toilet]] when needed. This group primarily includes [[infant]]s and young children, as well as some elderly people, some with a physical or [[Mental illness|mental]] [[disability]], people working in extreme conditions (e.g. [[NASA]] [[astronaut]]s<ref>http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/support/training/ascan/2004/journal12.html</ref>), and people with [[Diaper fetishism]].

==History==

The problem of clothing infants not yet [[toilet training|potty trained]] is as old as human history. Before the invention of modern diapers, mothers living in warm climates typically left their children naked and cleaned up their waste only when it interfered with eating, sleeping, or working. Northern cultures such as the Inuit and Lappi made use of absorbant[[sphagnum moss]] which is still used by native cultures for this purpose. When infants needed to be moved, they were wrapped tightly in home-spun cloths or in shells fabricated from plants or animal hides.  (A familiar example is the Native American [[papoose]], a bundled infant often depicted as carried on its mother’s back.)  In colder regions, infants were often bound up, neck to toe, in “swaddling clothes” or blankets that served multiple purposes:  keeping the infant warm and secure, freeing mothers to undertake chores, and acting as primitive diapers.  Sources on actual usage are scarce: one sixteenth century source claims the infant garments were changed every three or four days, while wet garments may not have been washed but simply dried and re-used.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

In the mid-nineteenth century, cheap manufactured [[cotton]] fabrics, such as [[flannel]] and [[muslin]], were newly available and affordable and cotton mills filled demand for clothing and accessories. Diapers were either purpose-cut or made from rags: typically rectangular or square in shape and were folded and fastened on infants as garments or undergarments. An important advance occurred in the late 1840s with the invention of the [[safety pin]].  The basic cotton diaper meanwhile evolved little through the decades, as it was inexpensive, versatile (bigger children could use bigger cloths), moderately absorptive, washable, and reusable: often from child to child in a family or community, whereas rural communities in England frequently had a parish layette trunk prepared by the vicar's wife and passed around new mothers {{Fact|date=June 2007}}.   

Even as cotton diapers gained acceptance numerous inventors and entrepreneurs sought to improve upon the limitations.  Between the 1880s and 1930s the United States government patent office recorded dozens of relevant “inventions,” including shaped and fitted diaper designs, alternative fastening systems, absorbent inserts, medicated surfaces, and moisture-proof covers.  In 1858, for example, J. H. Hall designed a moisture-proof attachment to a cloth diaper to capture and isolate waste.  
During the next few decades, more ideas and innovations surfaced:  a diaper with a disposable paper lining; rubberized panties with medicated surfaces; disposable absorbent cellulose pad inserts. 

The revolution in disposable diapers began in the 1930s. {{Fact|date=April 2007}} Perhaps in anticipation of wartime supply disruptions, the Germans were seeking alternatives to imported cotton for medical purposes and developed a technique to fabricate a soft cellulose tissue (“Zellstoff”) from wood pulp. This technique caught the attention of the Swedish paper company Pauliström Bruk, which in the late 1930s brought about a brand new concept whereby a special type of soft tissue sheets, cut into pieces and wrapped into a parcel, was placed in the baby’s pants. This represented the first step toward the disposable diaper.

Since these early innovations in the 1930s  the disposable diaper has continued to undergo significant technological advancements.  Disposables have replaced traditional cloth diapers throughout the developed nations and in most developing countries.  

===First disposable diapers===
*1941: First reference to a “disposable diaper” at Pauliström:  a 2-piece product consisting of a disposable pad of cellulose wadding with gauze or knitted mesh cover and a reusable panty. {{Fact|date=April 2007}}
*1946: American housewife Marion Donovan patents the “Boater” (waterproof cover with snaps for cloth diaper or disposable insert).{{Fact|date=April 2007}}
*1947: British mother Valerie Hunter Gordon develops a two-piece disposable diaper for her own baby and sells more than 400 to local women. Two years later, Robinson & Sons commercializes a two-piece Paddi Pad diaper based on this concept.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}.

==Types==
===Disposable===

Since their introduction several decades ago, product innovations include the use of super-absorbent polymers, resealable tapes and elasticised waist bands. They are now much thinner and much more absorbent. The product range has more recently been extended into children’s toilet-training phase with the introduction of training pants and pant diapers.   

Modern baby diapers and incontinence products have a layered construction, which allows the transfer and distribution of urine to an absorbent core structure where it is locked in. 

*The topsheet closest to the skin is made of soft nonwoven fabric and transfers urine quickly to the layers underneath;
*The distribution layer receives the urine flow and transfers it on to the absorbent core;  
*The absorbent core structure is the key component and is made out of a mixture of cellulose pulp and superabsorbent polymers;  
*The backsheet is typically made of ‘breathable’ polyethylene film or a nonwoven and film composite which prevents wetness transfer to the bed or clothes.

Disposable diapers have overtaken the cloth diaper market many times over. Approximately 18 billion units of disposable diapers were sold in the USA in 2004.

===Cloth===

Cloth diapers are reusable and are most often made of industrial [[cotton]]. The fabric may be [[bleach]]ed white or now more commonly left a natural color. Alternative materials which are becoming much more popular and more common are grown without pesticides, such as bamboo, unbleached [[hemp]], and organic cotton. Another popular non-natural fiber is polyester microfiber fleece, commonly used inside cloth diapers for its absorbency.
Pre-formed cloth diapers with snaps or hook and loop fasteners (similar to [[Velcro]]) and all-in-one diapers with waterproof exteriors are now available, in addition to the older pre-fold and pin variety. Increasingly popular are "pocket" or "stuffable" diapers, which consist of a water-resistant outer shell sewn with an opening in the back for insertion of absorbent material.
These place much less stress on landfills; however, they may also require laundering and high-temperature water to be properly cleaned. 
Cloth diaper-wearing children go through about 6,000 diaper changes. If thrown into a landfill, cotton diapers decompose within six months.<ref>http://www.punkinbutt.com/diaper_dilemma_the_environment.asp</ref> 
Some cities have a cloth diapering service that delivers clean diapers and picks up soiled ones for a fee.

== The Disposables versus Cloth Debate ==

A life cycle analysis is one way to choose between disposable diapers and reusable cloth diapers. This analysis attempts to take into account all the environmental factors, including raw material and energy usage, air and water pollution emissions, and waste management issues. Several such analyses have concluded that when all factors are taken into account, both types of diapers have roughly the same environmental effect. Others have come to opposing conclusions, depending on the biases of the investigators and the assumptions they made.

==Length of use==

While awake, most children no longer need diapers when past two to four years of age, depending on culture, diaper type, parental habits, and the child's personality. However, some children have problems with daytime or more often nocturnal bladder control until eight years or older. Known as enuresis, or more commonly [[bedwetting]], this may occur for a wide variety of reasons and can be both a short-term or long-standing issue.  With this as well as the increasing number of obese infants in developed countries, disposables manufacturers have made special diapers which mimic underwear and do not require complex fastening or adult assistance.  Standard but oversized diapers are also available, both cloth and disposable.

Bedwetting diapers are marketed under such [[euphemisms]] as "absorbent underwear" and "pyjama pants."  Available in boys and girls designs, they are aimed towards children roughly between the ages of four and fifteen. 

==Diaper Changing==
The replacing of a soiled diaper is commonly referred to as "diapering" or "diaper changing."  Diaper changing is essential to the prevention of contracting skin irritation of the buttocks, genitalia, and/or the waist. When to change a diaper is the decision of the caregiver. Some people believe that diapers should be changed at fixed times of the day for a routine, such as after naps and after meals. Other people believe that diapers should be changed when they feel a change is needed regardless of timing. Still others people believe a diaper should be changed immediately upon wetting or soiling.  And, some believe that a diaper should be changed only when the wearer is uncomfortable, the diaper is full, the diaper is leaking, or the wearer has a bowel movement.

To avoid skin irritation, commonly referred to as [[diaper rash]], the diaper of those prone to it should be changed as soon as possible after it is soiled (especially by fecal matter). The combination of urine and feces creates ammonia. [[Ammonia]] irritates skin and can cause painful redness. During the change, after the buttocks are cleaned and dried, some people use baby oil, barrier creme or baby powder to reduce the possibility of irritation. The most effective means to prevent and treat diaper rash is to expose the buttocks to air and sunshine as often as possible. There are also drying creams based on such ingredients as [[zinc oxide]] which can be used to treat diaper rash. Before disposing of a diaper, either in a diaper pail for washing or the garbage, fecal matter should be removed as much as possible and placed in a toilet to avoid [[landfill]] and [[ground water]] contamination.

Not a pleasant task, diaper changing is often a source of humour, espescially when performed by men<ref>Dads changing diapers[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTij4txO8Uk]</ref>.  [[Tom Selleck]] and [[Steve Guttenberg]] can be seen comically changing a baby's diaper in the 1987 movie ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]''.

==Word origin==
The word ''diaper'' originally referred to the type of cloth rather than its use.  

"Diaper" was originally the term for an overall pattern of small repeated geometric shapes, and then a white cotton or linen fabric with such a pattern. 

The first cloth nappies consisted of a special type of soft tissue sheet, cut into geometric shapes. This is how the term “diaper” acquired a new meaning and it is still used today for modern disposable nappies

The first known reference is in  [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' : "Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper". This usage stuck in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], but in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] the word ''nappy'' (short for baby [[napkin]]) took its place. {{Fact|date=April 2007}}

==Adult usage==
Diapers are occasionally worn by older children, youth or adults who are unable or not allowed to reach a toilet for longer than their bladders can hold out. They may be referred to as incontinence pads.

===Medical===
* People suffering from [[urinary incontinence|incontinence]].
* People who suffer from [[heavy sleeping]] (ie [[bedwetting]] children and older people).
* Women who are [[pregnancy|pregnant]] and must urinate very frequently, and urgently.
* People who are bedridden or recovering from surgery.
* People who are [[disabled]] and sometimes confined to a [[wheelchair]], or [[paralyzed]].

==Diapers and non-human species==
Diapers and diaper-like products are sometimes used on animals (mostly pets, but also sometimes laboratory and working animals). This is often due to the animal not being [[housebroken]]. Though, it may also be for older, sick, or injured pets who have become incontinent. In some cases, these are simply baby diapers with holes cut for the tails to fit through. In other cases, they are diaper-like waste collection devices.

Animals that are sometimes diapered include :

*[[Horses]] (often so their manure can be used for fertilizer or so the horses can be used in public settings without leaving droppings on the ground). If the horse is hauling, sometimes the diaper is a piece of strong cloth or plastic slung between the horse's hauling harness and the front of the cart or carriage. Some [[mare (horse)|mares]] are kept specifically for the production of urine, collected for [[premarin]], a hormonal drug.
*Dogs (often when a female is [[ovulation|ovulating]] and thus bleeding). 
*Monkeys and apes (most monkeys are physically unable to learn control of excretions, which is not a useful ability for tree-dwelling animals. Diapers are most often seen on trained animals who appear on TV shows, in movies, or for live entertainment or educational appearances).
