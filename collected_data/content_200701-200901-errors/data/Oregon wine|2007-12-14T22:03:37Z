The state of '''[[Oregon]]''' in the [[United States]] has established an international reputation for its production of '''[[wine]]'''.  Oregon has several different [[growing region]]s within the state's borders which are well-suited to the cultivation of [[grape]]s; additional regions straddle the border between Oregon and the states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Idaho]]. Wine making dates back to pioneer times in the 1840s, with commercial production beginning in the 1960s.

[[American Viticultural Area]]s entirely within the state include the Willamette Valley, Southern Oregon, Umpqua Valley, and Rogue Valley AVAs. Parts of the Columbia Gorge, Walla Walla Valley, and Snake River Valley AVAs lie within Oregon. [[Pinot Noir]] and [[Pinot Gris]] are the top two grapes grown, with over 16,000 tons (14,515 metric tons) harvested in 2005. As of 2005, Oregon wine makers produced over 1.5 million cases combined.

With 303 wineries in Oregon, a tourism industry has developed around wine tasting. Much of the tourism focuses on the wineries and tasting rooms in and around the Yamhill Valley southwest of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]. In 2004, it was estimated that wine tourism contributed USD $92 million to the state economy, excluding winery and tasting room sales.
__TOC__

==History of Oregon wine production==
{{main|History of Oregon wine production}}
Wine has been produced in Oregon since the [[Oregon Territory]] was settled in the 1840s; however, winemaking has only been a significant industry in the state since the 1960s.  Grapes were first planted in the [[Oregon Territory]] in [[1847]], with the first recorded winery being established in 1850 in [[Jacksonville, Oregon|Jacksonville]].  Throughout the 19th century, there was experimentation with various [[varietal]]s by immigrants to the state, and in 1904, an Oregon winemaker won a prize at the [[1904 St. Louis World's Fair|St. Louis World's Fair]].  Wine production would cease in the United States during [[prohibition]], and the Oregon wine industry lay dormant for thirty years after prohibition was repealed.<ref name="Chemeketa"> {{cite web

[[Image:David Lett.JPG|thumb|right|David Lett of [[Eyrie Vineyards]]]]
The Oregon wine industry started to rebuild in the 1960s, when California winemakers opened several vineyards in the state.  This included the planting of [[Pinot Noir]] grapes in the [[Willamette Valley]], a region long thought too cold to be suitable for viticulture.  In the 1970s, more out-of-state winemakers migrated to the state and started to organize as an industry.  The state's land use laws had prevented rural hillsides from being turned into housing tracts, preserving a significant amount of land suitable for vineyards.  In 1979, [[Eyrie Vineyards]] entered a 1975 Pinot Noir in the [[Wine Olympics]]; the wine was rated among the top Pinots in the world, thus gaining the region its first international recognition.<ref name="Chemeketa"/><ref name="Hall"/>

The accolades continued into the 1980s, and the Oregon wine industry continued to add both wineries and vineyards.  The state industry continued to market itself, establishing the first of several AVAs (American Viticulture Areas) in the state.  The state also grew strong ties with the [[Burgundy]] region of [[France]], as Oregon's governor paid an official visit to Burgundy and a leading French winemaking family bought land in [[Dundee, Oregon|Dundee]].<ref name="Chemeketa"/><ref name="Hall"/>

In the early 1990s, the wine industry was threatened by a ''[[Phylloxera]]'' infestation in the state, but winemakers quickly turned to the use of resistant [[rootstock]]s to prevent any serious damage.  The state legislature enacted several new laws designed to promote winemaking and wine distribution.  The state found a newfound focus on "green" winemaking, leading the global wine industry into more environmentally friendly practices.  Several new AVAs were established.  By 2005, there were 314 wineries and 519 vineyards in operation in Oregon.<ref name="Chemeketa"/><ref name="Hall"/>

==Varieties of wine==
Like other wines produced in the [[United States]], Oregon wines are marketed as [[varietal]]s.  Oregon law requires that wines produced in the state must be identified by the grape variety from which it was made, and must contain at least 90% of that variety.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  Oregon law has long forbidden use of place names, except as appellations of origin.<!-- blended wines?-->  Oregon is most famous for its [[Pinot Noir]], which is produced throughout the state.  Pinot Noirs from the [[Willamette Valley]] have received much critical acclaim from wine connoisseurs and critics, and Oregon is regarded as one of the premier Pinot-producing regions in the world.<ref> {{cite paper

As of the 2005 wine growing season, the state of Oregon has 303 bonded [[winery|wineries]], 384 wine brands, and 734 [[vineyards]] growing ''[[Vitis vinifera]]'', composing a total of {{convert|14100|acre|sqkm|0}} of which {{convert|11800|acre|sqkm|0}} were harvested in 2005.  Out of all US wine growing regions, Oregon ranked third in number of wineries and fourth in production.  Nearly 1.6 million cases of Oregon wine were sold in 2005. The retail value of these cases was $184.7 million, a 24% increase over the previous vintage.<ref> {{cite paper

The industry has had a significant economic impact on the state.  The industry contributed a total of USD $1.4 billion to the Oregon economy.  Of that figure, over USD $800 million is directly provided by wineries and vineyards via sales, wages, and spending.  It is estimated that the industry contributed 8,479 wine-related jobs and USD $203 million in wages.  Exports to other states in 2004 were USD $64.1 million.<ref name="OWC_Study">

Oregon produces wine on a much smaller scale than the [[California wine]] industry.  Oregon's biggest producer ships only 125,000&nbsp;cases per year and most produce under 35,000&nbsp;cases.

The Oregon wine industry focuses on the higher-priced segments of the wine market.  Oregon growers receive a higher average return per ton and a higher average revenue per case than do growers in other wine-producing regions in the United States.  Despite producing a much smaller volume of wine, Oregon winery revenues per capita are comparable to those of New York and Washington.<ref name="OWC_Study"/>

==Major wine-producing regions==
There are, loosely speaking, three main wine producing regions with a major presence in the state of Oregon, as defined by non-overlapping [[American Viticultural Area]]s.  Two of them—the [[Willamette Valley|Willamette Valley AVA]] and the [[Southern Oregon|Southern Oregon AVA]]—are wholly contained within Oregon; a third, the [[Columbia River Gorge|Columbia Gorge AVA]] straddles the [[Columbia River]] and includes territory in both Oregon and Washington; however, this AVA is considered to be an Oregon AVA.  Portions of the [[Walla Walla Valley AVA]], an area which is primarily in Washington (along with the [[Columbia Valley AVA]] which contains it), descend into Oregon in the [[Milton-Freewater]] area.  The Southern Oregon AVA was recently created as the union of two Southern Oregon winegrowing regions long considered distinct, the [[Rogue Valley]] and the [[Umpqua Valley]].  Several other smaller AVAs are found within some of these larger regions.<ref> {{cite web

===Willamette Valley===
[[Image:Wpdms shdrlfi020l willamette valley.jpg|thumb|left|The Willamette River Valley]]
{{main|Willamette Valley AVA}}
The '''Willamette Valley AVA''' is the wine growing region which encompasses the [[Willamette Valley]].  It stretches from the [[Columbia River]] in the north to just south of [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]] in the south, where the [[Willamette Valley]] ends; and from the [[Oregon Coast Range]] in the West to the [[Cascade Mountains]] in the East.  At {{convert|5200|sqmi|sqkm|-2}}, it is the largest AVA in the state, and contains most of the state's wineries; approximately 200 as of 2006.<ref> {{cite web

 | url=http://wine.appellationamerica.com/wine-region/Willamette-Valley.html
}} </ref>  

The climate of Willamette Valley is mild year-round, with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers; extreme temperatures are uncommon.  Most rainfall occurs outside the growing season and the valley gets relatively little snow.<ref> {{cite paper

This region is most famous for its [[Pinot Noir]], and also produces large amounts of [[Pinot Gris]], [[Riesling]], and [[Chardonnay]].  The region also produces [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Gewürztraminer]], [[Müller-Thurgau]], [[Sémillon]], and [[Zinfandel]] grapes, but in far smaller quantities.

The region is divided into four subordinate AVAs:  Dundee Hills, McMinnville, Ribbon Ridge, and the Yamhill-Carlton District.  Two more AVA applications are pending.  In addition, many wine connoisseurs further divide the Willamette Valley into northern and southern regions approximately at the [[latitude]] of [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]].

===Southern Oregon===

{{main|Southern Oregon AVA}}
The '''Southern Oregon AVA''' is an AVA which was formed as the union of two existing AVAs—the '''Rogue Valley AVA''' and the '''Umpqua Valley AVA'''.  (A small strip of connecting territory is included in the Southern Oregon AVA to make it a contiguous region; however, this strip passes through mountains regions not suitable for vineyards.)   This AVA was established in 2004 to allow the two principal regions in [[Southern Oregon]] to jointly market themselves.<ref> {{cite web

As the Rogue Valley and Umpqua Valley regions produce different grapes and different varietals, they are examined separately.  

====Umpqua Valley AVA====
The '''Umpqua Valley AVA''' contains the drainage basin of the [[Umpqua River]], excluding mountainous regions.<ref> {{cite web
 | title=Umpqua Valley AVA
 | publisher=Appellation America

}}</ref> The Umpqua Valley has a warmer climate than the Willamette Valley, but is cooler than the Rogue Valley to the south.  Grapes grown here include Pinot Noir, with smaller amounts of Pinot Gris, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, and Riesling, as well as several French-American hybrids.  The region includes one sub-AVA, the [[Red Hill Douglas County AVA]].  

====Rogue Valley AVA====
The '''Rogue River AVA''' includes the drainage basin of the [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]] and several tributaries, including the [[Illinois River (Oregon)|Illinois River]], the [[Applegate River]], and [[Bear Creek (Oregon)|Bear Creek]].  Most wineries in the region are found along one of these three tributaries, rather than along the Rogue River itself.  The region is {{convert|70|mi|km|-1}} wide by {{convert|60|mi|km|-1}} long (although much of the land within the AVA is not suitable for grape cultivation); there are less than 20 wineries with only {{convert|1100|acre|sqkm|0}} planted.  The three valleys differ greatly in [[terroir]], with the easternmost Bear Creek valley being warmest and driest, and the westernmost Illinois River valley being coolest and wettest.<ref name="Rogue"> {{cite web

Portions of northeastern Oregon (in the vicinity of [[Milton-Freewater]]) are part of the [[Walla Walla Valley AVA]], which was established in 1984.  This appellation, which is part of the [[Columbia Valley AVA]], lies primarily within Washington state.  This region has nearly 100 wineries and {{convert|1200|acre|sqkm|0}} planted.  Wines grown in the valley include [[Syrah]], [[Merlot]], and [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], as well as [[Sangiovese]] and a few exotic varietals including [[Counoise]], [[Carmenère]], [[Mourvèdre]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Nebbiolo]] and [[Barbera]].<ref> {{cite web

==Wine tourism==
With the continuing improvement in the region's winemaking reputation, [[wine tourism]] in Oregon has become a significant industry in its own right.  On-site sales are becoming an increasingly important part of the business of Oregon winemaking, and other businesses which cater to wine tourists, such as lodging, fine [[restaurant]]s, [[art gallery]]s, have been appearing in places like [[Dundee, Oregon|Dundee]], many of which have long been rural farming communities.  Wine festivals and tastings are commonplace.  It is estimated that wine tourism contributed USD $92 million to the state economy in 2004, excluding sales at wineries and tasting rooms.  There are approximately 1.48 million visits to Oregon wineries each year, 49% by Oregonians and 51% from out of state visitors.  Major events which draw significant numbers of tourists to wine country include the [[International Pinot Noir Celebration]] and the [[Oregon Pinot Camp]].<ref name="OWC_Study"/>
[[Image:Chehalem_pinot_noir_grapes.jpg|frame|left|Pinot noir grapes at Chehalem Ridgecrest Vineyard, [[Newberg, Oregon]]]]

Facilities for wine tourists in Oregon are considered underdeveloped compared to wine regions in California, especially premium growing regions like the [[Napa Valley AVA]].  Only 5% of overnight leisure trips in the state involve visits to wineries, a much smaller figure than comparable Californian growing regions which range from 10%&ndash;25%.<ref name="OWC_Study"/>  Oregon lacks many accommodations found in wine growing regions in other states such as luxury hotels, resorts, and other attractions suitable for well-heeled tourists.  As of August 2006, a resort hotel is being planned in Dundee, which would be located near notable wineries such as [[Domaine Drouhin Oregon]].  A local developer and businessman has proposed construction of a 50-room hotel, spa and restaurant in the Dundee Hills region, but has met with opposition from many notable vintners, including [[David Lett]], who fear that such a development would dramatically alter the landscape of the region.  Concern has also been raised by vintners that the proposed site is on prime growing land that should be used for wine production rather than a resort hotel.<ref> {{cite journal

The increase in winery-related tourism, as well as the presence of a [[Spirit Mountain Casino (Oregon)|casino]] in the Willamette Valley, has greatly impacted the region's transportation infrastructure.  [[Oregon Route 99W]], the highway which runs through the heart of Willamette Valley wine country (and which is the [[main street]] in towns such as [[Newberg, Oregon|Newberg]] and [[Dundee, Oregon|Dundee]]), is plagued with frequent [[traffic jam]]s.  Plans to construct a [[freeway]] bypass around Newberg and Dundee (avoiding the prime growing areas in the hills) are in motion,<ref> {{cite web
