'''Bad Street Brawler''' is a [[1987]] [[video game]] by [[Beam Software|Beam Software Pty., Ltd.]] specifically designed for use with the Nintendo Power Glove . It was distributed worldwide by [[Mindscape Group|Mindscape Inc.]] and [[Mattel]]. 

The player plays the character, Duke Davis, who walks around with blond hair, a yellow [[tank top]], [[sunglasses]], and yellow pants as he beats up [[gangsters]] that get in his way. He is described as a former [[punk rock]]er and the "world's coolect" [[martial artist]].

Before the start of the next stage, quotes are introduced to entertain the player (i.e., ''Never trouble trouble until trouble troubles you''). The player even has to beat up [[gorilla]]s and old ladies who throw pocketbooks at the player (resembling [[weightlifter]] dwarves who throw [[dumbbell]]s at the player). The "Trip" attack more closely resembles [[groping]].

The original ''Bad Street Brawler'' is one of the earliest [[Fighting game|beat-em-ups]] or side-scrolling fighting games.
