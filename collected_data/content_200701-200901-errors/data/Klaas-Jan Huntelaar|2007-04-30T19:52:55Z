'''Klaas Jan Huntelaar''' (born [[August 12]], [[1983]] in [[Drempt]], [[Gelderland]], [[Netherlands]]) is a Dutch [[football (soccer)|footballer]] who plays as a [[striker]] for [[Ajax Amsterdam]] and [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], where he has replaced [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] as striker after he fell out with coach [[Marco van Basten]]. He is seen as a rising star in Dutch football, having scored 33 goals in the [[Eredivisie 2005/2006|2005/06 Eredivisie campaign]], making him top scorer. His nickname is 'The Hunter'.

==Club career==
===PSV===
In 2000, aged 16, Huntelaar joined PSV Eindhoven’s academy and established himself as a prolific goalscorer for their youth team.

He made his debut for PSV during the first half of the 2002-2003 season but this was to prove his one and only Eredivisie appearance for the club.

===De Graafschap / AGOVV===
Having failed to establish himself in the first team he was loaned out to [[De Graafschap]] to gain experience. He made 9 Eredivisie appearances for ‘the Super Farmers’ but failed to score.

In the summer of 2003 Huntelaar was again loaned out. This time to [[AGOVV Apeldoorn]] in the Dutch First Division. He was an instant success scoring 26 times in his 35 league appearances and finished the season as the divisions top goalscorer.

===SC Heerenveen===
After the player turned down the opportunity to sign a new contract with PSV [[SC Heerenveen]] moved in to sign him for a transfer fee of €100,000. The following season he scored 17 goals in 31 matches to help Heerenveen qualify for the UEFA Cup. 2005/06 saw him score 17 goals in 15 matches, form which earned him a mid-season transfer to Ajax, who paid € 9 million + future extensives for the player. A substantial sum went to rivals [[PSV Eindhoven]] as a result of the training compensation rule imposed by [[FIFA]]. 

===Ajax===
[[Image:Huntelaar Trophy.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Celebrating with Ajax]]
Huntelaar had an immediate impact at Ajax, scoring perhaps his most spectacular goal of the season, a [[bicycle kick]] in injury time of the [[KNVB Cup]] semifinal against [[Roda JC]], which squared the match and allowed Ajax to go on to victory after the extra periods. Huntelaar then went on to score a brace, including the winner, against PSV Eindhoven to bring Ajax its 16th KNVB Cup.

Huntelaar was the first player to score a goal at [[Arsenal F.C.]]'s new [[Emirates Stadium]] in a testimonial match for [[Dennis Bergkamp]] on [[July 22nd]], [[2006]] - a match Ajax ended up losing 2-1 (although in the second half, which started off with Ajax leading 1-0, 'legends' like [[Johan Cruijff]], [[Marco van Basten]] and [[Ian Wright]] played instead).

Huntelaar started the 2006/07 campaign by scoring a brace against Copenhagen in the first leg of the [[UEFA Champions League]] 3rd qualifying round.

===Possible transfer from Ajax===
Ajax issued a hands-off warning following speculation that [[Newcastle United]] was interested in signing the player in the January transfer window. <ref name="newcastle">{{cite news | title=Newcastle warned off Huntelaar and Emanuelson | url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=393206&cc=5901 | publisher=ESPN Soccernet | date=[[2006-11-21]] | accessdate=2006-12-14}}</ref> [[Manchester United]] and [[Liverpool]] are also said to be very interested in the player. 
[[Juventus]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Olympique Lyonnais]] and [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] are also interested in signing the striker. <ref name="juve">{{cite news | title=Sosa And Huntelaar Followed By Juventus | url=http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=199480 | publisher=Goal.com| date=[[2006-12-28]] | accessdate=2006-12-30}}</ref><ref name="arsenal">{{cite news | title=Juventus chief Bettega makes Huntelaar check  | url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/article.php?id=23225 | publisher=TribalFootball| date=[[2006-12-29]] | accessdate=2006-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Strikers A Priority For Lyon  | url=http://www.soccer365.com/EUROPEAN_NEWS/Rest_of_Europe/page_109_134981.shtml | publisher=Soccer365| date=[[2007-01-15]] | accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref><ref name="valencia">{{cite news | title=LOS TÉCNICOS DEL CLUB SIGUEN AL PUNTA DEL AJAX HUNTELAAR  | url=http://www.as.com/articulo/futbol/tecnicos/club/siguen/punta/Ajax/Huntelaar/dasftb/20070208dasdaiftb_24/Tes/ | publisher=AS| date=[[2007-02-08]] | accessdate=2007-02-14}}</ref>

In an interview on March 22nd 2007, he told Italian newspaper "La Gazzetta dello Sport" that his idols were Ruud Gullit and Dennis Bergkamp and today he loves AC Milan striker Filippo Inzaghi.<ref>{{cite news | title=Huntelaar: «Pronto per l'Italia» (Gazzetta dello Sport)  | url=http://www.goal.com/it/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=263389/ | publisher=Goal.com| date=[[2007-03-23]] | accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref>

[[FC Barcelona]] are also interested in signing the striker, with a reported 4 year €15 million deal in the works. <ref>{{cite news | title=Nu ook Barcelona geïnteresseerd in Huntelaar  | url=http://www.v-bal.nl/nieuws/bekijk.php?id=21518 | publisher=V-Bal!| date=[[2007-03-22]] | accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref>

==International career==
Despite being in the preliminary squad, Huntelaar was not chosen for the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]] at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. Coach [[Marco van Basten]] explained that he felt Huntelaar would benefit from more experience and from playing at the [[UEFA U-21 Championship 2006|UEFA Under 21 football championships]], going as far as to say that it was up to Huntelaar to "show us there that [by not selecting Huntelaar] we did not do the right thing".{{Fact|date=March 2007}} While Holland went on to score no goals against quality opposition at the World Cup in Germany, Huntelaar led the Dutch to victory as the top-scorer of the Under 21 tournament with four goals, including a wonderful strike in the semi-final against France and a brace in the final against Ukraine. Huntelaar was named in the [[2006 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship#Player awards|UEFA Team of the Tournament]] as a striker.

Marco van Basten decided to call Huntelaar as his starting striker in the Dutch National squad's friendly against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] on August 16, 2006. Huntelaar paid immediate dividends by scoring two goals (another one was disallowed by a controversial off-side call by the referee, denying him the hat-trick), and making two assists, in Holland's 4-0 victory.
