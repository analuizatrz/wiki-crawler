'''Deborah Ann Harry''' (born [[July 1]], [[1945]], in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]]) is a [[Grammy Award]]-winning, and [[Golden Globe]]-nominated American [[rock and roll]] musician, [[pop icon]], [[sex symbol]], and a [[Diva]] from [[New Jersey]]. She originally gained fame as the frontwoman for the [[New Wave music|new wave]] band [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]. Following this success, she went on to develop prolific careers as a solo musician and an actress.  

== Life and career ==
Harry was [[adopted]] at three months of age by a family from [[Hawthorne, New Jersey]] and attended [[Hawthorne High School (New Jersey)|Hawthorne High School]]. Prior to starting her singing career she moved to New York in the late 60's and worked as a secretary at the BBC Radio New York office for one year. Later, she was a waitress, a dancer in [[Union City, New Jersey|Union City]], and a [[Playboy Bunny]].<ref>{{cite news

== Early musical career ==

She began her musical career with the folk rock group, the Wind in the Willows. Harry then joined a girl-group trio, The Stilettos, in the early [[1970s]]. The Stilettos' backup band included her eventual boyfriend and Blondie guitarist, [[Chris Stein]]. Harry and Stein formed the band Blondie in the mid 1970s, naming it after the [[street harassment|catcall]]s men would give Harry while passing by in their cars. Blondie quickly became regulars at [[Max's Kansas City]] and [[CBGB's]] in [[New York City]]. After a debut album in 1976, commercial success followed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, first in Australia and Europe, then in the United States.

== In Blondie ==

With her two-tone bottle-blonde hair, Debbie Harry quickly became a recognizable icon of [[punk fashion|punk]] style. Her look was further popularized by the band's early presence in the music video revolution of the era. The clip for '[[Rapture (song)|Rapture]]' appeared within the first 24 hours of [[MTV]]'s launch. Harry's strong stage persona of cool sexuality and streetwise style became so closely associated with the group's name that many came to believe the singer's name to be "Blondie", to her lasting chagrin.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} To complicate matters further, Harry has sometimes described "Blondie" as being the character she plays onstage with the band as well as the band's name.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The difference between the individual Harry and the band Blondie was famously highlighted with a "Blondie is a Group" button campaign by the band in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rip-her-to-shreds.com/archive_press_magazines_rm28april79.php|title=More Males Per Oxide|publisher=[[Record Mirror]] (mirrored at Blondie fansite)|date=[[April 28]] [[1979]]|accessdate=2006-09-26}}</ref>

== Solo career begins: KooKoo == 

Harry began her solo career with the Gold Certified album ''[[Koo Koo]]'' in [[1981]] (see [[1981 in music]]). At the time, Blondie had not officially disbanded, so the solo album was seen as a side project and a tentative step toward a solo career. ''Koo Koo'' was a collaboration with [[Chic]]'s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards and featured the artwork of [[H.R. Giger]] on the cover. '[[Backfired]]' was the first single from the album, followed by '[[The Jam Was Moving]]'. Two tracks, 'Backfired' and 'Now I Know You Know' had music videos directed by Giger.

== The demise of Blondie: The Hunter ==

In 1982 Blondie regrouped and released their sixth studio album ''[[The Hunter (Blondie album)|The Hunter]]'', which featured the U.S. and U.K. hit single '[[Island of Lost Souls (song)|Island of Lost Souls]]' and the U.K. hit '[[War Child (song)|War Child]]'. Blondie launched a North American tour to support the release, however, this was cut short when Harry's lover, guitarist [[Chris Stein]], fell ill with the rare genetic disease [[pemphigus]]. From 1983 through 1986, Harry minimized her public life and musical career in order to care for him. Stein fully recovered and continues a musical relationship with Harry, but their romantic relationship ended in 1987.

During this period Harry teamed up with [[Giorgio Moroder]] (with whom she had worked previously on Blondie's 'Call Me') on the song 'Rush Rush', which was featured in the film ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' (and later, the [[Grand Theft Auto III]] radio station "Flashback FM"). She appeared on Broadway with [[Andy Kaufman]] in the wrestling play ''Teaneck Tanzi''. A retitled version of the British play ''Trafford Tanzi'', the show failed to transplant itself successfully to Broadway, and opened and closed in one night.

In 1983 Harry, who had already appeared in a number of independent and underground films, made her major motion picture debut in the [[David Cronenberg]] film ''Videodrome'', in which she plays the character Nicki Brand.

== Rockbird ==

Harry's single 'Feel the Spin', produced by [[John "Jellybean" Benitez]], was released in [[1985 ]], and along with the whole soundtrack to the film ''[[Krush Groove]]'', peaked at #2 on the U.S. Dance Charts. The song's 'uno dos tres quatro' intro has been sampled on a number of records including S-Express's 'Theme From S-Express'.

In 1986 Debbie Harry released her second solo album ''[[Rockbird]]'' and the single '[[French Kissin' (Debbie Harry song)|French Kissin' in the USA]]' brought her into the U.K. top 10 singles chart. Other singles released from the album were 'Free to Fall' and '[[In Love With Love]]' which hit #1 on the U.S. Dance Charts. 'In Love With Love' was a club hit with a proliferation of remixes. Following the release of ''Rockbird'', Debbie took a number of acting roles including the part of Velma Von Tussle in [[John Waters]]' '[[Hairspray]]' (1988). She also appeared in the U.S. TV series [[Wiseguy]]. A cover of the [[The Castaways]]' 'Liar Liar' from the soundtrack to the film ''Married to the Mob'' was released as a single in the U.S. Harry's version of Micheal Jay's 'Mind Over Matter' was also recorded in this period, but never released.

== Def, Dumb and Blonde ==

Debbie Harry's next solo venture was the album ''[[Def, Dumb and Blonde]]'' in [[1989]]. Anchored by the songwriting partnership of Harry and guitarist Chris Stein, ''Def, Dumb and Blonde'' was primarily produced by Blondie producer [[Mike Chapman]], with [[Thompson Twins]] and [[Arthur Baker]] producing two further tracks each. At this point Harry reverted from "Debbie" to "Deborah" for her professional name. The first single '[[I Want That Man]]' was a big hit in Europe, Australia, and on the U.S. Modern Rock Charts. She followed this up with the ballad 'Brite Side' and the club hit 'Sweet and Low' (both of which were produced by Arthur Baker). 'Maybe For Sure', a track orginally originally recorded for the ''Rock and Rule'' animated film, was the fourth single released from the album in June 1990 to coincide with a U.K. tour. 'Kiss It Better' was also a Top 15 Modern Rock single in the U.S. and also a moderate hit in Australia.

== The Complete Picture ==

During the period 1989 to 1991 Deborah toured extensively across the world with former Blondie guitarist Chris Stein, [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]]'s [[Karl Hyde]], and [[Blondie]] Mk2 bassist [[Leigh Foxx]]. In July 1991 she played Wembley Stadium with [[INXS]]. She also starred in the film ''Intimate Stranger'' in which she played a telephone sex worker pursued by a serial killer. In 1991 Chrysalis released a "best of" compilation in Europe entitled ''The Complete Picture: The Very Best of Deborah Harry and Blondie'', containing hits with Blondie as well as solo hits. The collection reached number three in the UK album charts. The album also included her duet with [[Iggy Pop]] on the Cole Porter song 'Well Did You Evah!' (produced by Stein) from the ''[[Red Hot and Blue]]'' AIDS charity album released at the end of 1990. While recording her next album in 1992 Deborah Harry collaborated with German metallers [[Die Haut]] on the track 'Don't Cross My Mind', and released the song 'Prelude to a Kiss' on the soundtrack to the film of the same name. She also released a cover of 'Summertime Blues' from the soundtrack to the film ''That Night'' in Australia.

== Debravation ==

Deborah Harry's fourth solo album ''[[Debravation]]'' appeared in July 1993. Variously produced by Chris Stein, Arthur Baker and [[Anne Dudley]], the album's first single was the Baker produced 'I Can See Clearly' which was a hit in the U.K. and on the U.S. dance charts (reaching number 2). The B-side was a duet with [[Joey Ramone]] entitled 'Standing In My Way'. This was followed by 'Strike Me Pink' in September. Controversy surrounded the latter track's drowning man video, which was banned and subsequent record company promo cancelled. U.S. editions of the album feature two additional tracks recorded with pre-recorded music by [[REM]]: 'Tear Drops' and 'My Last Date (With You)'. In November 1993 Deborah Harry toured the UK with Chris Stein, [[Peter Min]], [[Greta Brinkman]] and [[James Murphy]]. The set list of the Debravation Tour featured an offbeat selection of Harry material including the previously unreleased track 'Close Your Eyes' (from 1989) and '[[Ordinary Bummer]]' (from the Stein produced [[Iggy Pop]] album ''[[Zombie Birdhouse]]''; a track which under the moniker 'Adolph's Dog' Blondie would cover in 1997). Tentative plans to record these shows and release them as a double live CD never came to fruition. However, a cover of [[The Rolling Stones]] '[[Wild Horses]]' is available as a bootleg. At the end of 1993 Chrysalis released the Blondie rarities collection ''Blonde and Beyond'', which featured the previously unreleased tracks 'Scenery' and 'Underground Girl'. In early 1994 Harry took the ''Debravation'' tour to the U.S.
==Jazz Passengers==
In the mid-nineties, Harry teamed up with NYC avant-garde jazz ensemble [[The Jazz Passengers]]. Between 1994 and 1998 she was a permanent member of the troupe, touring North America and Europe. She was a featured vocalist on their 1994 album ''In Love'' singing the track 'Dog In Sand'. The follow-up album, 1997's ''Individually Twisted'', is credited as "The Jazz Passengers featuring Deborah Harry" and Harry sings vocals throughout, teaming up with guest Elvis Costello for a cover of 'Doncha Go Way Mad'. The album also features a re-recorded version of the song 'The Tide Is High', which she had previously had a hit with while a part of Blondie. A live album entitled ''Live In Spain'', again featuring Harry on vocals, was released in 1998.

Harry collaborated on a number of other projects with a myriad of artists. She featured as vocalist on Talking Heads side project The Heads' 1996 release ''No Talking Just Head'' (performing the title track and 'Punk Lolita'). She also sings on a cover of 'Strawberry Fields' by Argentian band [[Los Fabulosos Cadillacs]]. In 1997 she collaborated with Jazz Passenger [[Bill Ware]] in his side project Groove Thing, singing lead vocals on the club hit 'Command and Obey'. Another JP collaboration appeared on the [[Edgar Allan Poe]] tribute album ''[[Closed On Account of Rabies]]'' (1997). Harry also reunited with Blondie keyboardist [[Jimmy Destri]] for a cover of [[Otis Blackwell]]'s 'Don't Be Cruel' for the 1995 tribute album ''Brace Yourself''. The 90's also saw the release of Blondie remix albums ''Beautiful'' (in Europe) and ''Remixed Remade Remodeled'' (in the U.S.). New mixes of 'Heart of Glass', 'Atomic', and 'Union City Blue' were released as singles and all made the UK Top 40, while remixes of 'Atomic', 'Rapture', and 'Heart of Glass' had major success on the U.S. dance charts.

== 1997 - present: Blondie's back ==

In 1997 Blondie began working together again for the first time in 15 years. Two tracks recorded with T.V. Mania (the production duo of [[Duran Duran]] members [[Nick Rhodes]] and [[Warren Cuccurullo]]), 'Studio 54' and 'Pop Trash Movie' were scheduled to be released on a Blondie compilation entitled ''This Is Blondie''. However, the project and the tracks were shelved as the four original members (Harry, Stein, Burke and Destri) embarked on sessions for what would become Blondie's seventh studio album. During this period they released a cover of Iggy Pop's 'Ordinary Bummer' on the Pop tribute album ''We Will Fall'' (1997).

After a final tour of Europe with The Jazz Passengers in the summer of 1998, Deborah Harry resumed duties as lead vocalist of Blondie. Prior to the release of [[No Exit]] the band completed a rapturously received sell out tour of Europe. Dates at London's Lyceum Theatre were recorded by the BBC and aired on UK Radio. A week prior to the release of ''No Exit'', the lead single 'Maria' debuted at number one in the UK, making Harry the oldest female singer to reach No. 1 in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] a record she still holds. 'Maria' hit #1 in 14 different countries, the top 10 on the US Dance Charts, and Top 15 on the US Adult Top 40 Charts. The album ''No Exit'' debuted at No.3 in the UK and #17 in the US, where it is very close to gold certification, and Blondie announced dates for a major Arena tour that summer during which they played the Glastonbery Festival and Party in the Park in London. 'Nothing Is Real But The Girl' was another UK Top 30 hit, while the title track was released as a single to coincide with further arena dates in November that year. 

Tracks culled from dates throughout the 1999 world tour were released as a live album, titled ''Live'' in the U.S. and ''Livid'' in the U.K., and released in late 1999 and early 2000 respectively. A ''Blondie Live'' companion DVD was also released, recorded at a show in NYC Town Hall.

Although Blondie commenced recording tracks for the follow-up to ''No Exit'' in 2001 the session were besieged with problems including the loss of master tapes after 9/11 (though the loss of master tapes had nothing to do with the incident itself). In the winter of 2002 Blondie burst back into life with a full scale UK tour. This preceded the release of a new single in summer of 2003 entitled 'Good Boys' (a hit across the UK and Europe that autumn, and top 10 on the US Dance Charts the following spring) and the release of Blondie's eighth studio album, the critically acclaimed ''The Curse of Blondie''. Blondie toured throughout 2003 and 2004 completing two further full scale tours of the UK. A second live album, entitled ''Live By Request'', was released in 2005 along with companion DVD set. 2005 saw the release of a dual disk CD/DVD of ''The Curse of Blondie'' and a mash-up, 'Rapture Riders', which combined their 1981 hit 'Rapture' with [[The Doors]]' 'Riders on the Storm'. In the winter of 2005 Blondie toured the UK for the fourth time in as many years. 

In 2006 they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Around this time  Blondie released a new studio track, a cover of the famous [[Roxy Music]] song 'More Than This' to promote their "Road Rage" tour. Dates have just been announced for a UK tour in the summer of 2007.

== Solo projects: 1997 - present==
Aside from writing and recording material for Blondie, Harry pursued a number of solo projects. She appears on the 2001 Bill Ware album ''Vibes 4'' singing the track 'Me and You' as well as on ex-Police guitarist [[Andy Summers]]'s album, ''Peggy's Blue Skylight'' on the track 'Weird Nightmare'. A techno cover of Stan Jones' 'Ghost Riders in the Sky' was featured on the soundtrack to the film ''Three Business Men'' and was available on her website to download. Harry sings on two tracks on Andrea Griminelli's ''Cinema Italiano'' project; 'Amarcord' and 'You'll Come To Me', as well as on a tribute album reinterpreting the music of Harold Arlen, on which she sings the title track 'Stormy Weather'. A high point in Deborah Harry's career as a solo artist came in May 2002 when accompanied by The Jazz Passengers and the BBC concert orchestra she performed a selection of her jazz material at the Barbican centre in London.

In 2003 she was featured vocalist on the song 'Uncontrollable Love' by electro-clash dance producers Blow Up. Harry appeared on the ''VH1 Divas Live'' television show, as well as Lifetime's Annual Cancer Awareness Show, where she sang various Blondie hits, as well as dueting with Joss Stone on 'One Way or Another', and Shirley Manson on 'Bounce Along'.

Deborah Harry has continued to produce new music in a variety of guises. In 2006 she spoke out against rapper [[Lil' Kim]]'s incarceration in the song 'Dirty and Deep' released via the internet. November 2006 saw the release of a collaboration with [[Moby]] on the electro-pop hit 'New York New York'. Throughout this period a number of new tracks have surfaced (but since disappeared) from Harry's MySpace page, including 'Charm Alarm', 'Deep End', and 'School for Scandal', as well as a song called 'God Save New York' in which she dueted with Miss Guy (of Toilet Boys fame). Recorded with NYC producer Super Buddha, it is anticipated that these may surface on a Deborah Harry solo album to be released in 2007, possibly to be promoted while she co-headlines [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s True Colors Tour, in support of the U.S. gay rights organization HRC (Human Rights Campaign).
 

== Acting roles ==
Some of Harry's notable film roles are appearances in ''[[Videodrome]]'' ([[1983]]); ''[[Union City]]'' ([[1980]]); ''[[New York Beat]]'' (otherwise known as ''[[Downtown '81]]'', in which she plays the angel of the East Village alongside [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]]); ''[[Rock & Rule]]'' ([[1983]]), an animated movie where she did vocals opposite [[Robin Zander]] of [[Cheap Trick]]; [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]' ''[[Hairspray (film)|Hairspray]]'' ([[1988]]), in which she played the big-haired and villainous Velma von Tussle, paired with [[Sonny Bono]] as her husband; and ''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100740/ Tales from the Darkside: The Movie]'' ([[1990]]). She also had notable roles in such films as ''[[Spun]]'', ''[[Cop Land]]'','' [[Heavy]]'' and ''[[My Life Without Me]]'', and is featured in David Munro's upcoming feature film ''[[Full Grown Men]]''.

Her TV guest appearances include ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', ''[[MADtv]]'', ''[[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'',  ''[[Will & Grace]]'', ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (as a musical guest and a host) and ''[[Wiseguy]]''.

She had a voice role in the video game, ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'', as a cab dispatcher, and sang "[[Ghost Riders in the Sky]]" over the closing credits of [[Alex Cox]]'s film ''[[Three Businessmen]]''.

She played the role of "Elizabeth" in the [[Full motion video|FMV]]-based game [[Double Switch]], which was released for the [[Sega CD]] ([[1993]]), the [[Sega Saturn]], [[Apple Macintosh]], and [[Windows 95]].

She played the lead in the 2005 short film [[I Remember You Now]] directed by Henry S. Miller, and worked with the same director again in his 2007 psychological thriller [[Anamorph]].
