'''Bruce Randall Hornsby''' (born [[November 23]], [[1954]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[singer]], virtuoso [[pianist]], [[accordion]] player, and [[songwriter]].  Known for the spontaneity and creativity of his live perfomances, Hornsby draws frequently from [[classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], [[bluegrass]], [[folk]], [[motown]], [[rock]], [[blues]], and [[jam band]] musical traditions with his songwriting and the seamless improvisations contained within.  Hornsby describes his approach to his music as follows:
::''"To be creative, spontaneous in the moment and make music in the present tense, that's what we're all about live. I write the songs, we make the records and then the records become a departure point, the basic blueprint, the basic arrangement. I'm fairly restless creatively. I was never a very good Top 40 band guy because I never liked to play the same thing every time. Too often songwriters approach their songs like museum pieces. I don't subscribe to that. I think of my songs as living beings that evolve and change and grow through the years."''<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.brucehornsby.com/bio.htm|title=Bruce Hornsby Bio from Official Website}}</ref>

"Bruce Hornsby struck RIAA gold--and triple platinum!--with his [[1986 in music|1986]] debut album, ''The Way It Is'', recorded with his band, the Range. His debut generated three Top 20 hits, including its #1 title track, and earned Bruce Hornsby & the Range the Best New Artist [[Grammy]] for [[1986 in music|1986]]. Hornsby took home his second [[Grammy]] in [[1989 in music|1989]] for Best Bluegrass Recording for "Valley Road" (from the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]]'s ''Will The Circle Be Unbroken, Volume II'') and his third [[Grammy]] in [[1993 in music|1993]] for Best Pop Instrumental for "Barcelona Mona" (created with [[Branford Marsalis]] for the [[Barcelona Olympics]])."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.jambase.com/search.asp?bandID=1186&display=bio|title=JamBase Bruce Hornsby Bio}}</ref>  Most recently, Hornsby's composition "Song H" was nominated for Best Pop Instrumental at the [[2007]] [[Grammy Awards]].

He is also well-known for being a recurring collaborator with the [[Grateful Dead]].

==Early years==
Hornsby is the second of three sons born to Lois (Saunier) and Robert S. Hornsby, who was a successful oil and real estate executive in Williamsburg, Virginia. The other sons, Robert "Bobby" Jr., and Jonathan, are highly regarded musicians in their own right.

Hornsby grew up listening to all types of music.  He studied music at the [[University of Richmond]], as well as the highly regarded [[Berklee College of Music]] and the [[University of Miami]], from which he graduated in 1977.  

In the spring of 1974, Hornsby's brother Bobby, who was a brother of the [[Beta Theta Pi]] fraternity at the [[University of Virginia]], formed a band, "Bobby Hi-Test and the Octane Kids" to play fraternity ragers, featuring Bruce on Fender Rhodes and vocals.

:''"We used to play college grain-alcohol parties," remembers Hornsby. "We did a little [[Allman Brothers]], a little [[The Band|Band]], but almost all [[Grateful Dead|Dead]]. We used to do 'Jack Straw', 'Sugar Magnolia', 'Truckin',' 'Not Fade Away', 'Goin' Down the Road Feelin' Bad'...lots of ''Europe '72'' and ''Skull and Roses''. We didn't do a whole lot of money gigs, but it was more about just going to this country house that my brother lived in with all these hippies, and sitting around playing."''<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.realhornsby.com/octanekids.htm|title=Bobby Hi-Test and the Octane Kids Page}}</ref>

Following his graduation from the [[University of Miami]], Hornsby spent time in [[Los Angeles]] as a [[session musician]] and songwriter before moving back to his native southeastern [[Virginia]].

==Range years==

In [[1984 in music|1984]] he formed '''Bruce Hornsby and the Range''', who were signed to [[RCA Records]] in [[1985 in music|1985]].  Besides Hornsby, Range members were [[David Mansfield]] ([[guitar]], [[mandolin]], [[violin]]), George Marinelli (guitars and [[backing vocals]]), [[Joe Puerta]] ([[bass guitar]] and backing vocals), and John Molo ([[drums]]). 

[[Image:The way it is hornsby.jpg|200px|left|The Way It Is (1986)]]

Hornsby's recording career started with the biggest hit he would ever have, entitled "The Way It Is".  With a propulsive yet contemplative piano riff and the refrain, ''That's just the way it is, some things will never change'', the song was both catchy and reflective of the [[American Civil Rights movement]], and it topped the American music charts in [[1986 in music|1986]]. In years to come, the song would be sampled by at least six [[rapping|rap]] artists, including [[Tupac Shakur]], [[E-40]], and [[Ma$e|Mase]].  It is also used as some of the introductory music to [[Sean Hannity]]'s popular [[talk radio]] program.

With the success of the single worldwide, the album ''[[The Way It Is (Bruce Hornsby album)|The Way It Is]]'' went [[RIAA certification|multi-platinum]] and produced another top five hit with "Mandolin Rain" (co-written, as many of Hornsby's early songs were, with his brother John).  "Every Little Kiss" also did respectably well.  Other tracks on the album helped establish what some labeled the "Virginia sound", a mixture of [[rock music|rock]], [[jazz]], and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with an observational [[Southern United States|Southern]] feel.  Hornsby and the Range would go on to win the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]] in [[1986 in music|1986]].

The wave of fame continued to roll with Hornsby and the Range's second album, ''Scenes From The Southside'' (on which [[Peter Harris]] replaced Mansfield). Released in [[1988 in music|1988]], it featured such hits as "Look Out Any Window" and "The Valley Road". The song "Jacob's Ladder" was featured as well, having originally been written by Hornsby for musician friend [[Huey Lewis]]. Lewis' version became a number one hit from his album ''[[Fore!]]''. ''Scenes'' was successful in its own right and it would also be the last to perform so well in the singles market.
 
In [[1988 in music|1988]], Hornsby first appeared on stage with the [[Grateful Dead]], a recurring collaboration that would continue until the band's dissolution.  Hornsby went on to appear on stage frequently as a guest before becoming a regular fixture in the touring lineup for the [[Grateful Dead|Dead]] a few years later.  In [[1989 in music|1989]] Hornsby co-wrote and played piano on [[Don Henley|Don Henley's]] big hit "[[The End of the Innocence (song)|The End of the Innocence]]".  In [[1991 in music|1991]] Hornsby played piano on [[Bonnie Raitt|Bonnie Raitt's]] popular hit "[[I Can't Make You Love Me]]".  Hornsby would feature both of these songs in his own concerts.

"Hornsby slowly began to slip [[jazz]] and [[bluegrass]] elements into his music. In [[1989 in music|1989]], he performed at the [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]]. He also reworked his hit "The Valley Road" with the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], which scored a [[Grammy]]"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.musicbox-online.com/bh-int.html|title="Against the Grain: An Interview with
Bruce Hornsby", first appeared at The Music Box, November 2000, Volume 7, #11, written by John Metzger}}</ref>  ''A Night On The Town'' was released in [[1990 in music|1990]], on which he teamed up with [[jazz]] musicians [[Wayne Shorter]] and [[Charlie Haden]].  A change in style became apparent as the album was much more guitar driven, incorporating [[Jerry Garcia]]'s guitar work on a number of tracks.  "In concert, Hornsby and the Range began to stretch out their songs, incorporating more and more freewheeling musical exchanges. Yet at their heart, the group was still a rock band, and after a final three-week tour in [[1991 in music|1991]], Hornsby disbanded the outfit to enter a new phase of his career."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.musicbox-online.com/bh-int.html|title="Against the Grain: An Interview with
Bruce Hornsby", first appeared at The Music Box, November 2000, Volume 7, #11, written by John Metzger}}</ref>  Drummer John Molo continued to perform regularly with Hornsby, although other members pursued separate musical endeavors.

==Solo years==

[[Image:HornsbyFreeImage4.jpg|left|thumb|350px|Hornsby performing, stage and light show]]
Bruce Hornsby played [[piano]] (and occasionally the [[accordion]]) nightly with the [[Grateful Dead]] from [[September]] [[1990 in music|1990]] through [[March 24]], [[1992 in music|1992]], lending some assistance to the [[Grateful Dead|Dead]]'s somewhat unstable keyboards position.  Hornsby joined the band following the death of [[Brent Mydland]] and preceding the incorporation of [[Vince Welnick]] as full-time keyboardist.  His performances with the [[Grateful Dead|Dead]] would impact his own music as observed in an interview:

::''"[the [[Grateful Dead|Dead]]'s] loose-knit expressions further pushed [Hornsby} outside the confines of mainstream pop. Said Hornsby, 'I loved the music. I loved the songs. I loved their approach to playing their songs. There’s so much about the [[Grateful Dead]] experience musically that has been an influence on me. Once I started playing with the Dead, I think it definitely opened me up."''<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.musicbox-online.com/bh-int.html|title="Against the Grain: An Interview with Bruce Hornsby", first appeared at The Music Box, November 2000, Volume 7, #11, written by John Metzger}}</ref>

Hornsby's connection to the band also helped to revitalize improvisation and refocus [[Jerry Garcia]]'s guitar solos in the band's sound.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.philzone.com/interviews/hornsby/|title="Grateful Family and Friend Bruce Hornsby", Interview conducted October 9, 2000 by Tim Morris}}</ref>  Hornsby reflected upon his musical relationship to [[Jerry Garcia]] during his performances with the [[Grateful Dead|Dead]] as follows:

::''"We [Hornsby and Jerry Garcia] had a close connection. And I think it was pretty clear to people who were just watching, he'd always be looking over and laughing at me. We'd play things off of each other. Yeah, he was a great friend and musical partner"''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.popmatters.com/music/interviews/hornsby-bruce-060921.shtml|title="Intersections of Musical Directions: An Interview with Keyboard Great Bruce Hornsby 
", 21 September 2006, by Greg M. Schwartz}}</ref>

Hornsby originals "The Valley Road" and "Stander on the Mountain" would work their way into the [[Grateful Dead|Dead]]'s setlists.  Hornsby also co-composed the song "Silver Apples of the Moon" for the [[Grateful Dead]]'s ''[[Infrared Roses]]''. This collaboration would continue on a less regular basis until the [[Grateful Dead]] ended in [[1995 in music|1995]]; in all he made several hundred concert appearances with them.

In other respects, Hornsby's overall approach to his craft was continuing a transition that began even before his appearances with the [[Grateful Dead|Dead]].  Hornsby discussed this as follows:

::''"However, it would be a real easy, sort of sound bite explanation to say ‘well he started playing with the Dead and then he loosened up,’" [Hornsby] continued. "I mean, I got my degree in jazz music so the jazz influence has not much to do with the Dead, as you can see. I was always interested in that music. Harmonically, I loved the sound of the chords. I’m a piano player, and so for me, the jazz language is more colorful...more varied. It’s more expressive for me, and so I’ve gravitated toward that and compositionally, I’ve gone in that direction many times since [[1990 in music|1990]].'"''<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.musicbox-online.com/bh-int.html|title="Against the Grain: An Interview with Bruce Hornsby", first appeared at The Music Box, November 2000, Volume 7, #11, written by John Metzger}}</ref>

Hornsby would go on to release his first solo album, ''Harbor Lights'', in [[1993 in music|1993]].  This record showcased Hornsby in a more jazz-oriented setting and featured an all-star lineup, including [[Pat Metheny]], [[Branford Marsalis]], [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Phil Collins]], and Raitt.  The tone was set by the opening title track, which after 50 seconds of expansive solo piano (written and recorded by Hornsby after the rest of the track was finished, because, as Hornsby would later say, he thought it would make a good opening to the album) lurches into an up-tempo jazz number, ending with [[Pat Metheny|Metheny]]'s guitar runs.  The album closes the same way on "Pastures of Plenty", this time with an extended guitar solo from [[Jerry Garcia|Garcia]] intertwined with Hornsby's piano.  Hornsby also quotes the main musical phrase from the [[Grateful Dead]]'s "[[Dark Star (song)|Dark Star]]" in his song about tensions surrounding an biracial relationship, "Talk of the Town".  The mid-tempo "Fields of Gray", written for Hornsby's recently-born twin boys, received some modest radio airplay.

''Harbor Lights'' was well-received by critics and fans, but Hornsby acknowledged that his days of popular commercial success were behind him, saying in interviews that it had been an accident that his [[McCoy Tyner]]-influenced piano work ever found itself in the middle of a hit record in the first place.  Hornsby relates this act of fusing multiple styles of music to his evolving audience's tastes as well:
::''"I've always liked the group of fans that we've drawn from the Grateful Dead time, because those fans are often adventurous music listeners."''<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.brucehornsby.com/bio.htm|title=Bruce Hornsby Bio from Official Website}}</ref>  

[[Image:HornsbyHotHouse.jpg||300px|right|Hot House (1995)]]

In [[1995 in music|1995]], ''Hot House'' was released with its cover art, featuring an imagined jam session between [[bluegrass]] legend [[Bill Monroe]] and [[jazz]] legend [[Charlie Parker]], serving as an apt metaphor for the rich fusion of musical styles Hornsby was currently developing and expanding. The [[jazz]] feelings that peppered the previous album would be expanded on here, intermingling with [[bluegrass]], giving the album a constant uptempo party sound. As is typical with Hornsby, the underlying messages behind the catchy tunes are often very dark, such as on "Country Doctor" and "White Wheeled Limousine". This album would include lyrics built around [[murder]], [[nuclear accidents|nuclear disaster]], [[adultery]], among others.  The album featured many of the same guests as on his previous record, such as [[Pat Metheny]], and added [[folk music]] lyricism to Hornsby's usual mix.  [[Béla Fleck]] also collaborates again on banjo, having previously appeared on ''A Night on the Town''.  As a testament to Hornsby's willingness to allow songs space to grow and evolve, it is worth noting that the song "White Wheeled Limousine" had debuted five years earlier as an encore to [[Branford Marsalis]]'s opening act for the [[Grateful Dead]]'s 12/31/90 New Year's Concert, (Marsalis and [[Rob Wasserman]] joined Hornsby in the performance).  The ''Hot House'' version of "White Wheeled Limousine" pairs [[Pat Metheny]]'s guitar with [[Béla Fleck]]'s banjo for a blisteringly intricate call-and-response alongside Hornsby's piano runs.  ''Hot House'' also makes an homage to Hornsby's years with the [[Grateful Dead|Dead]] via his recasting of the instrumental bridge of the [[Grateful Dead|Dead]]'s song "Estimated Prophet" as the newly-lyricized Hornsby tune "Tango King."  The album also boasts more prominent roles for ''Harbor Lights'' alums John D'earth on trumpet and Bobby Read on woodwinds, and Read continues to perform with Hornsby to this date.

During this time period, "even his concerts conveyed a looser, more playful mood, and Hornsby began taking requests from the audience."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.musicbox-online.com/bh-int.html|title="Against the Grain: An Interview with Bruce Hornsby", first appeared at The Music Box, November 2000, Volume 7, #11, written by John Metzger}}</ref>  His most requested song was "The Show Goes On," despite its having appeared years earlier on ''Scenes from the Southside'', due to its very emotive appearance in Ron Howard’s movie ''Backdraft''.  Hornsby playfully describes the audience requests, which would become a hallmark of his live shows, as follows:  
::''"The most unusual requests come in the form of requested medleys. People who are aware of what we do, know that we run songs together, and so they’ll come with their own completely outside medley requests such as "What a Time" into "Play that Funky Music" into "Whiter Shade of Pale."  Now, of course, a lot of that sounds ridiculous, and it wouldn’t work. But sometimes I’ll see one that I think is interesting, and I’ll see if I can find a way to seamlessly thread these seemingly disparate elements together."''<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.musicbox-online.com/bh-int.html|title="Against the Grain: An Interview with Bruce Hornsby", first appeared at The Music Box, November 2000, Volume 7, #11, written by John Metzger}}</ref>

Hornsby next worked with several [[Grateful Dead]] reformation projects, including several Furthur Festivals and the ultimate formation of [[The Other Ones]], which resulted in the release a live album, ''[[The Strange Remain]]''.  Hornsby's [[piano]] and vocals factor heavily into the band's performance of classic [[Grateful Dead|Dead]] tunes "Jack Straw" and "Sugaree" (which features Hornsby on lead vocal, in [[Jerry Garcia]]'s absence), and Hornsby-originals "White-Wheeled Limousine" and "Rainbow's Cadillac" receive reworkings in the hands of [[The Other Ones]]. 

[[Image:HornsbySpiritTrail.jpg|left|Spirit Trail (1998)]]

Three years after ''Hot House'', Hornsby released a [[double album]], ''Spirit Trail''. Featuring a decidedly goofy picture of his uncle on the cover, the collection blends instrumental tracks with the story-telling, [[rock]], [[jazz]], and other musical forms Hornsby had delved into over his career.  Over the two discs, Hornsby weaves a tapestry of varied textures, from the fervent spirituality then almost [[gospel]] dirge of "Preacher in the Ring, parts I & II," to the catchy chord progressions of "Sad Moon." Among other homages, the song "Sunflower Cat (Some Dour Cat) (Down With That)" samples and loops the main lick from the [[Grateful Dead]] song "China Cat Sunflower."  In some of the songwriter's most poignant lyrics to date, this album considers, as Hornsby puts, issues faced growing up and living in the American South:  

::''"[Spirit Trail] is very Southern so there's a lot of songs about race, religion, judgment and tolerance and sort of my own personal struggles with some of these issues -- or observing others with the issues."''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/brucehornsby/articles/story/5919218/bruce_hornsby_redefines_himself|title="Bruce Hornsby Redefines Himself Piano Virtuoso Follows 'Spirit Trail'", written by ARI BENDERSKY, October 15, 1998}}</ref>

Looking specifically at some of the album's more introspective tracks, one observes a type of soul-searching in "Resting Place."  "Hornsby takes the listener down his road to enlightenment: ''I'm on a long sojourn/I'm sitting here shedding my skin/Don't know about inside, ugly on the outside/They're all messing with me for the shape I'm in/I'm looking for a clean slate/Just need a new mind state.'' His introspective journey continues with the somber "Fortunate Son," a song that grapples with issues of success and defeat: ''I've stared down the devil and had to look away/Called out to angels but no one ever came/Laid down odd and even but double zero played/That's alright I'm a lucky one, such a fortunate son.''"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/brucehornsby/articles/story/5919218/bruce_hornsby_redefines_himself|title="Bruce Hornsby Redefines Himself Piano Virtuoso Follows 'Spirit Trail'", written by ARI BENDERSKY, October 15, 1998}}</ref>

Hornsby's piano playing gained further complexity with ''Spirit Trail'', as evidenced by his two-hand-independence on such tracks as "King of the Hill," and began prompting Hornsby's devoted fanbase to not only request songs at concerts but to begin requesting techniques such as "two-hand-independence" or "spider fingers" (referencing the opening barrage of notes from that track off of ''Hot House'').  Hornsby himself reflects on this period of intensive solo work in his craft as follows:

::''"I've recommitted myself to the study of piano.  I've taken my playing to a whole new level.  It's not something you'd hear with a band."''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/brucehornsby/articles/story/5919218/bruce_hornsby_redefines_himself|title="Bruce Hornsby Redefines Himself Piano Virtuoso Follows 'Spirit Trail'", written by ARI BENDERSKY, October 15, 1998}}</ref>

Hornsby's own touring band line up underwent extensive change during this period as well, not the least of which was the apparent end of musical collaboration with long time drummer John Molo.  As Hornsby experimented with a different sound, ushering in frequent collaborations with such musicians as [[Steve Kimock]] on guitar and Bobby Read on heavily effects-driven electronic woodwinds, his current band, dubbed The Noise Makers, took shape.  In [[2000 in music|2000]], Hornsby chronicled this journey with a compilation live album entitled ''Here Come The Noise Makers'', and did extensive touring.

''Here Come the Noisemakers'' not only captures the ambience of one of Hornsby’s concerts, but it also reflects the vibrant temperament and true stylistic diversity with which he approaches his craft.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.musicbox-online.com/bh-int.html|title="Against the Grain: An Interview with Bruce Hornsby", first appeared at The Music Box, November 2000, Volume 7, #11, written by John Metzger}}</ref>  Hornsby discusses the record in the following terms:  [[Image:HornsbyFreeImage.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Hornsby performing live]]
::''"It’s very spontaneous, and new things are happening in the moment.  As opposed to most live records that you would hear, I really feel that this is a singular musical statement — as creatively new a statement as any of my studio records because I really think it shows our approach and how we try to make the songs new.  I’m really interested in true spontaneity and I think that does come off here.  That’s not really something that’s very typical of the pop world at all.  I don’t know many bands [in any genre] that really do that.  Sure there is the jam band area, but I don’t hear a lot of true spontaneity there either.  A lot of people...most of America probably wouldn’t recognize me.  I wanted there to be a document out there [that defines what] we really sound like.  I think [''Here Come the Noisemakers''] really shows what my concert musical experience is about."''<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.musicbox-online.com/bh-int.html|title="Against the Grain: An Interview with Bruce Hornsby", first appeared at The Music Box, November 2000, Volume 7, #11, written by John Metzger}}</ref>

It would not be until [[2002 in music|2002]] when he would release another album of new material, entitled ''Big Swing Face''.  Hornsby wanted to experiment and did so by dropping the piano almost completely in favor of electric pianos and other [[synthesizers]].  ''Big Swing Face'' also evidences a greater reliance upon programmed loops than most of his prior work, as well as lyrics that are in many ways more eccentric and humorous.  Although the album marks perhaps Hornsby's most experimental work, including the track "Stick and Stones" which Hornsby cites as his partial homage to [[Radiohead]]'s "Everything in its right place," the album was not well-received by many and was poorly promoted by RCA, perhaps prompting Hornsby's decision to leave the label.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hornsby, Bruce. Liner notes from ''Intersections'' Box Set}}</ref>

In [[2004 in music|2004]], after 19 successful years on RCA Records, Hornsby returned to a more acoustic, piano-driven sound on his [[Columbia Records]] debut ''Halcyon Days''. Guests included [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Elton John]], and [[Eric Clapton]].  The tracks "Gonna Be Some Changes Made,"  "Candy Mountain Run," "Dreamland," and "Circus On The Moon" would become quick concert staples, each showcasing the diversity of Hornsby's improvisations and the Noise Makers' live sound.  Notably, ''Halcyon Days'' also includes a suite of solo piano songs--"What The Hell Happened To Me," "Hooray For Tom," and "Heir Gordon"--which all have a [[vaudeville]] vamp about them, a [[Randy Newman]]-esque sound.  With no signs of slowing down yet, Bruce Hornsby remains a musician more concerned with his devoted fan base and his own growth as an artist than with commercial success.

In July [[2006 in music|2006]], Hornsby released a box set titled ''Intersections'' {1985-2005}.  The set contains 4 audio CDs containing some pre-released songs and many new songs and recordings from concerts.  Much of the music contains collaborations with such artists as The [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], [[Chaka Khan]], and [[Branford Marsalis]].  The set also includes a DVD containing music videos and video recordings of several songs. All ticketholders on Hornsby's [[2006 in music|2006]] Solo Piano tour received a free copy of this set.  Among ''Intersections'' is the Grammy nominated track "Song H," which competed for Best Pop Instrumental at the [[2007 in music|2007]] [[Grammy Awards]].

Hornsby also has worked with many other artists, including [[Béla Fleck]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Roger Waters]], [[B. B. King]], [[Leon Russell]], [[Crosby Stills and Nash]], [[Warren Zevon]], [[Stevie Nicks]], [[Squeeze]], [[Sheena Easton]], and [[Steve Kimock]]. He continues to work with [[Grateful Dead|Dead]]-related projects, such as [[Bob Weir]]'s [[Ratdog]], [[Mickey Hart]]'s solo albums, and in [[2005]] participated in a tribute concert to [[Jerry Garcia]].

* On [[January 4]], [[2007]] [[Bob Weir]], [[Bill Kreutzmann]] and [[Mickey Hart]] reunited along with Bruce Hornsby, [[Mike Gordon]] (of [[Phish]] and the [[Rhythm Devils]]) and [[Warren Haynes]] to play two sets at a post-inauguration fundraising party for speaker of the house [[Nancy Pelosi]]. They were billed as "Your House Band" and performed some [[Grateful Dead]] classics such as "[[Truckin']]" and "[[Touch of Grey]]". Other performers appearing at the event included [[Tony Bennett]], [[Wyclef Jean]] and [[Carol King]]. <ref name="houseband">[http://www.relix.com/content/view/2053/112/ Relix: Dead, Phish, Allmans Members Serve as “House Band” for Pelosi-palooza]</ref>

* Hornsby has taken an ownership interest in Williamsburg area radio station "The Tide", WTYD 92.3 [[FM broadcasting|FM]], so that (he said) his music could be heard on the radio in his hometown. Accordingly, his ''Brunch with Bruce'' program, where he plays selections from his concerts, is heard on Sunday mornings.

* On [[March 20]], [[2007 in music|2007]], [[Legacy Recordings|SonyBMG/Legacy]] will release an eponymous collaboration of [[country]] and [[bluegrass]] legend [[Ricky Skaggs]] with Bruce Hornsby.

:The [[Legacy Recordings|SonyBMG/Legacy]] Press release had the following to say about the project:

:::''Backed by Skaggs' ace band Kentucky Thunder and a few special guests, the album's eleven songs draw from deep roots in mountain music -- adding piano and Hornsby's inimitable songwriting to the core bluegrass lineup of mandolin, guitar, bass, fiddle, and banjo.'' 

:::''The album kicks off with "The Dreaded Spoon" an autobiographical story of youthful ice-cream thievery. "A Night On The Town," also a Hornsby original, invokes Appalachian storytelling traditions, with a jubilant chorus contrasting the verses' cautionary tale. Other highlights include two traditional arrangements, "Across The Rocky Mountain" and "Hills Of Mexico," as well as the driving Skaggs original instrumental 'Stubb.''' 

:::''Surprisingly, two of the most familiar songs prove to be at once the most startlingly innovative: "Mandolin Rain" is reinvented as an acoustic ballad transposed to a minor key. While the smash hit is as readily recognizable today as it was twenty years ago, here context brings the lyrics into sharp relief and prompts rediscovery of the song's setting -- the cool evening twilight of a bluegrass festival. Meanwhile the album's closer "Super Freak" (the Rick James song) jumps out of the speakers as a tongue in cheek hillbilly rave-up.'' 

:::''Skaggs and Hornsby are at work on a busy slate of appearances for the spring and summer. Highlights include a major CMT "Crossroads" special airing February 24th, and live engagements in the spring. The pair performed a sneak preview concert in New York City on January 21st at B.B. King's, showcasing material from the new album.''<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.brucehornsby.com/ink/2007_skaggs-hornsby_release.swf|title=Skaggs-Hornsby Album Press Release}}</ref>
