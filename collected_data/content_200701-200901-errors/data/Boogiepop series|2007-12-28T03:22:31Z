To face the "enemies of the world", the ''[[shinigami]]'' Boogiepop automatically rises to the surface.  In Boogiepop's world, the Towa Organization, a shadowy group seeking to control humanity, managed to capture an alien organism who had taken the form of a [[evolution|highly-evolved]] human.  By studying him, the Towa Organization was able to create synthetic humans, people who have been artificially enhanced with special abilities.  The mission of the Towa Organization and its agents is to find and kill MPLS, people who are more evolved than others and possess special abilities.   However, Boogiepop will not let the Towa Organization get its way and he is not alone in his efforts.

The Boogiepop series is very much about the characters: their relationships, their pasts, their memories.  This is especially true for how their pasts moulded them into the people they are today.  It can also be seen through scenes being presented from the perspective of different characters, and how the individual casts a different "feel" by how they relate to events.<ref name="bpdvd1com">DVD commentary featuring Jeff Thompson and Joe DiGiorgi (August 2001) ''Boogiepop Phantom Evolution 1''</ref>  Another important theme is change.  How the world changes and our different perceptions of this change, especially how one's perception of things changes as they grow up.<ref name="bpdvd2com">DVD commentary featuring Jeff Thompson, [[Crispin Freeman]], and Rachel Lillie (2001) ''Boogiepop Phantom Evolution 2''</ref>  ''[[Boogiepop Phantom]]'' is also highly [[metaphorical]], with a character or an image representing much more than face value.<ref name="bpdvd4com">DVD commentary featuring Jeff Thompson and Angora Deb (2002) ''Boogiepop Phantom Evolution 4''</ref>  It is also "a show about the inter-related nature of people's lives and the concept that they know of as time."<ref name=afbp>{{cite web|url=http://www.animefringe.com/magazine/02.01/feature/1/|title=Boogiepop Phantom - A Myriad of Moments Past and Present|last=Arnold|first=Adam|accessdate=2006-08-07|date=January 2002|publisher=Animefringe}}</ref>

Kadono has published fourteen light novels and has serialised [[short stories]] in ''Dengegi HP'',<ref name="mcshorts">{{cite web|url=http://mostlycloudy.net/~ballzapalooza/boogiepop/ss.htm.ja.euc|last=Collette|first=Chris|title=Boogiepop Short Stories|accessdate=2006-06-20}}</ref> many of which have been published as a four-volume series about Pete Beat, a member of the Towa Organisation.

== Characters ==
{{Main|Characters of the Boogiepop series}}
Each Boogiepop title has its own cast of characters, and many of these characters will make appearances in more than one title, but there are only four central characters that are consistently at the center of the plot.

; {{nihongo|[[Boogiepop (character)|Boogiepop]]|ブギーポップ|Bugīpoppu}}
[[Image:Boogiepop character Boogiepop.jpg|left|80px|An illustration of Boogiepop by Kouji Ogata, from the Boogiepop and Others light novel]]
The [[shinigami]] whispered of among the female students of Shinyo Academy, few people know that Boogiepop actually exists.  Normally dormant, Boogiepop rises to the surface when enemies of the world appear.  Boogiepop's appearance and voice are ambiguous: they seem both masculine and feminine at the same time.  However, hidden beneath his signature black cloak and black, pipe-shaped hat, little is ever seen of him.  Straight-faced and to the point, Boogiepop acts as mechanical as he claims to be.  Boogiepop speaks in an archaic manner, and seems fond of whistling the overture to [[Wagner|Wagner's]] ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]''.

; {{nihongo|[[Kirima Nagi]]|霧間凪|Kirima Nagi}}
[[Image:Boogiepop character Kirima Nagi.jpg|right|80px|An illustration of Kirima Nagi by Kouji Ogata, from the Boogiepop and Others light novel]]
Known as the Fire Witch to many, Kirima has made few friends due the way she distances herself from others: she knows that she is too dangerous for 'normal' people to associate with.  She has a [[messianic complex]], and seeks to save the world from whatever may threaten it.  As such, whenever there are unusual happenings within the city, Kirima can be found investigating what has happened.  In the past, she had spent a period of time in hospital.  A combination of the events from that period of her life, as well as the death of her father, the famous writer Kirima Seiichi, brought her to follow this path in life.  Extremely gifted both physically and intellectually, she has the basic tools she needs to carry out her self-appointed mission.

; {{nihongo|[[Miyashita Touka]]|宮下藤花|Miyashita Tōka}}
[[Image:Boogiepop character Miyashita Touka.jpg|left|80px|An illustration of Miyashita Touka by Kouji Ogata, from the Boogiepop and Others light novel]]
An ordinary, happy school girl at Shinyo Academy, Miyashita is in love with her boyfriend, Takeda Keiji, and close friends with Suema Kazuko.  Not particularly good at school, she does not stand out in any way.  Unknown to most, she was hospitalized as a child, and this saw her life change, though even Miyashita herself does not seem to know the truth of what happened, and was simply told that she had been possessed by a [[kitsune]].  Unknowingly, when the world is in trouble, she carries a Spalding sports bag containing the effects of Boogiepop, her [[disassociative identity disorder|alternate personality]].  She has no recollection of her time as Boogiepop, and alters her memories to explain the blanks.

; {{nihongo|[[Suema Kazuko]]|末間和子|Suema Kazuko}}
[[Image:Boogiepop character Suema Kazuko.jpg|right|80px|An illustration of Suema Kazuko by Kouji Ogata, from the Boogiepop and Others light novel]]
As a result of a childhood trauma, Suema has developed an unusual fascination with [[criminal psychology|criminal]] and [[abnormal psychology]], as well as the desire to not let anything occur around her without her knowing.  As a result of this, she desperately seeks the truth about the unexplained events happening in her city, and meddles with forces best left untouched.  Good friends with Miyashita Touka, Suema appreciates how she so open and unconditionally accepting of her, and looks out for her friend.  She seeks to be closer with Kirima Nagi, who seems to know the answers to the questions that have haunted her all these years.

===Impact and influence===

''Boogiepop and Others'' won the Fourth [[Dengeki Novel Prize]] in 1997 and was released in the Dengeki Book Collection in 1998 where it gained popularity.<ref name="baohob">History of Boogiepop ([[2005-03-01]]) ''Boogiepop and Others''</ref>  It is credited with popularizing light novels,<ref name="sselicense" /> as well as redefining young adult fiction in Japan.<ref name="annbr1rev">{{cite web|url=http://animenewsnetwork.com/reviews/display.php?id=1017|last=Martin|first=Theron|title=Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator, Part 1|date=[[2006-07-27]]|accessdate=2006-07-28|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}</ref>   It was later adapted into a live action film by Ryu Kaneda, a two-volume manga by Kouji Ogata and served as the inspiration for a [[soundtrack]] composed by [[Yuki Kajiura]].<ref name="ultimate1" />  ''Boogiepop and Others'' also sets the scene for the anime, ''Boogiepop Phantom'', which has its backstory loosely based on the climax of the light novel.  Having already gained a strong readership among High School and University age men, the release of ''[[Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator Part 1]]'' was met with overwhelming support.  By the time the ''Boogiepop and Others'' film was released, the Boogiepop series was a bestseller, with over 2 million copies in print.<ref name="baohob" />

===Reviews===
The Boogiepop series has received high praise from critics.  ''Boogiepop Phantom'' has received the most exposure, where it is often compared to ''[[Serial Experiments Lain]]'' and ''[[Paranoia Agent]]''.<ref name="ultimate2">{{cite web|url=http://www.gomanga.com/news/boogiepop_02.php|last=Smith|first=Lesley|title=Boogiepop: The Ultimate Guide (Part 2 of 4)|date=[[2006-01-30]]|accessdate=2006-06-20|publisher=[[Seven Seas Entertainment]]}}</ref>  It has been noted that the series is "not your average anime", and one that "demands your attention".<ref name="ntusabprev">{{cite book|last=Lopez|first=Javier|year=2003|month=January|title=[[Newtype USA]]|publisher=[[A.D. Vision]]|pages=??}}</ref>  While the fine detail the animators went into with the visuals has received much praise, bland character designs have been noted as one of the series' flaws, though "astute viewers may notice some rather interesting [...] differences between the various characters."<ref name="annev1rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/reviews/display.php?id=170|last=Macdonald|first=Christopher|title=Boogiepop Phantom Evolution 1 DVD|date=[[2001-11-15]]|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}</ref>  The soundtrack has received much acclaim, not only for the [[background music]] and [[voice actor]] performances, but also the detail that went into the [[sound effects]].<ref name="aodvdbprev">{{cite web|url=http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/123.php|last=Beveridge|first=Chris|title=Boogiepop Phantom|date=[[2001-10-30]]|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=Anime on DVD}}</ref>  The presentation of the storyline was well received, but it was acknowledged that not everyone would be interested in following the subtle clues in each episode.<ref name="thembprev">{{cite web|url=http://themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=68|last=Cynova|first=Isaac|title=Boogiepop Phantom|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews}}</ref>  A common complaint, however, is that there are many loose ends, mainly relating to the back-story,<ref name="sfbprev">{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue253/anime.html|last=Robinson|first=Tasha|title=Boogiepop Phantom|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=SciFi.com}}</ref> leaving the series "with more questions than answers".<ref name="ntusabprev" />

Far less critiqued, the ''Boogiepop and Others'' film fares less well than its sequel.  Whilst the characters and plot were well received, the [[special effects]] and costumes have been described as "campy", but "par for the course of something of this level and budget".<ref name="aodvdborev">{{cite web|url=http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/3885.php|last=Beveridge|first=Chris|title=Boogiepop and Others|date=[[2005-07-02]]|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=Anime on DVD}}</ref>  The movie is, however, cited as being easier to watch, and is recommended to fans of the anime, so as to gain "a complete understanding of the Boogiepop events".<ref name="mementoborev">{{cite web|url=http://www.designchronicle.com/memento/archives/boogiepop_and_others.html|title=Boogiepop and Others|date=[[2004-02-11]]|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=Memento}}</ref>

The ''Boogiepop and Others'' novel has received more favorable reviews, though these have mostly focused on the translation, which has been cited as "a standard against which future Japanese novel translations are judged".<ref name="annbonrev">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/reviews/display.php?id=959|last=Martin|first=Theron|title=Boogiepop and Others|date=[[2006-03-13]]|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}</ref>  It has also received praise for ripping "the rules of narrative wide open",<ref name="rtobonrev">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/columns/rightturnonly.php?id=25|last=Santos|first=Carlo|title=RIGHT TURN ONLY!!|date=[[2006-03-21]]|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}</ref> especially for how it allows the characters to grow on the reader.<ref name="aodvdbonrev">{{cite web|url=http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/manga/manga.php?manga_view=2051|last=Pine|first=Jarred|title=Boogiepop|date=[[2006-03-17]]|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=Anime on DVD}}</ref>  ''Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator Part 1'' continues receiving positive feedback for its easy-to-read style and excellent translation, as well as its use of atmosphere and characters.  The main flaw, however, is the briefness of the title, which has clearly been used to set-up the sequel.<ref name="annbr1rev" />

''Boogiepop Doesn't Laugh'' has received generally favourable reviews, particularly for capturing some of the more complicated scenes better than the original light novel.  This makes the plot easier to follow, and captures the urgency of the climactic battle.<ref name="rtobdl2rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/columns/rightturnonly.php?id=34|last=Santos|first=Carlo|title=RIGHT TURN ONLY!!|date=[[2006-07-25]]|accessdate=2006-07-26|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}</ref>  However, it has been noted that breaking the complicated plot of ''Boogiepop and Others'' into a multi-volume manga results in individually weak volumes.<ref name="rtobdl1rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/columns/rightturnonly.php?id=28|last=Santos|first=Carlo|title=RIGHT TURN ONLY!!|date=[[2006-05-02]]|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}</ref>  As with ''Boogiepop Phantom'', the character designs have been noted as "lookalike and nondescript", which can make some of the events difficult to follow.  The art has also been described as "washed out and dull".<ref name="rtobdl2rev" />
