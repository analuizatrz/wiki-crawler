'''Pandit Nathuram Premi''' was a writer, publisher, poet, editor, linguist and an intellectual giant in the field of [[Jainism]] as well as [[Hindi]] literature. A budding poet, he wrote under the nom de plume of "Premi". Although belonging to the [[Digambara]] sect of [[Jainism]], he adopted a non-sectarian attitude and published and translated many [[Digambara]] as well as [[Svetambara|Śvetāmbara]] works. Working as a clerk in a firm in Mumbai he rose to establish his own publishing house and bookstore  [http://www.gohgk.com Hindi Granth Ratnākar Kāryālay] which published works of many of the biggest names in Indian literature, including Munshi Premchand, Hajariprasad Dvivedi, Jainendrakumar, Yashpal, Sharatchandra Chatterjee and Rabindranath Tagore. The bookshop and publishing house now called [http://www.hindibooks.8m.com Hindi Granth Karyalay]is now being managed by his grandson and great grandson nearly 100 years after its establishment.

==Early life==
Born on 26 November 1881 in Devari, in the district of Sagar in [[Bundelkhand]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], Nāthūrām Premī was the eldest child of Tundelal Modi, a travelling merchant of modest means, belonging to the [[Parwar|Paravāra]] community of [[Digambara]] Jains hailing from [[Bundelkhand]]. He studied in grammar school and was the monitor of his class. He cleared his pre-high school exams in 1898 and became a schoolteacher nearby at Rehli. In the late 1890s, he married Rama Devi, who was from the nearby village of Sarkheda, in the district of Sagar.

==Arrival in Mumbai==

{{IAST|In 1901, the [[Digambara]] Jain Tīrthakṣetra Committee, Mumbai, released an advertisement for an office clerk. Nāthūrām Premī sent in an application for the post and his beautiful handwriting won the job for him. He arrived in Mumbai in 1901, and started working for the [[Digambara]] Jain Tīrthakṣetra Committee as a clerk. His efficiency and honesty soon ensured that he was running the entire office from accounts, and correspondence, to general administration and handling the safe. However a complaint against him resulted in the audit of his books and cash balances. When his name was cleared, Nāthūrām Premī decided not to work for anyone who questioned his honesty and quit the job. The owner of Hirabaug, Seth Manikchandra, impressed by his honesty, diligence and intellect asked the young Nāthūrām Premī to take up rooms at the Hirabaug Dharmashala at the heart of the [[Mumbai]] market and start his business from there. He accepted the offer and together with Pannalal Bakhliwal started the ''Jain Grantha Ratnākara Kāryālaya'' in 1906.}}

==Career in Hindi and Jain Literature==

Nāthūrām Premī excelled in the field of literature as a poet, editor, writer and publisher earning respect and affection of his contemporaries like [[Munshi Premchand]], Mahaviraprasad Dvivedi, Rahul Sankrityayan, Pandit Sukhlalji, Muni Jinavijayaji, Ganeshprasadji Varni, Pandit Becharadasji Doshi, Pandit Agarchand Nahata and Dr Dalsukh Malvania.<ref> Pandit Sukhlalji, Muni Jinavijayaji,, Pandit Becharadasji Doshi, Pandit Agarchand Nahata and Dr Dalsukh Malvania acknowledged their debt to Premiji in a festschrift dedicated to him Section l, "Abhinandana", Premī Abhinandana Grantha, Pages 1- 62. </ref> Premiji and [[Munshi Premchand]] were close friends, and he published the first edition of Munshi Premchand's classic novel, ''Godān''. He also published Premchand's short story collections entitled Nava Nidhi and Sapta Saroj.
===A Budding Poet ===
Under the inspiration of  his guru Syed Amir Ali Mir, Nathuram became a budding poet, writing in Urdu and Braj under the nom de plume of "Premi". Since then he was affectionately called Premiji by his friends and contemporaries. His poems were published in the literary magazines of the time, Rasika Mitra, Rasika Vātikā and Kāvya Sudhākara. 

===Editor and Writer===

{{IAST|While he was working for the [[Digambara]] Jain Tīrthakṣetra Committee, Premiji also edited ''Jain Mitra'', making it one of the most influential Jain magazines of that era. In 1912, <ref> {{IAST|''Jain Hitaiṣī''}} ran from 1912 to 1921, when it had to be closed down due to lack of funds.</ref> he founded the ''Jain Hitaiṣī'', a Jain magazine with a reformist and questioning approach. Jain Hitaiṣī was known for the forthright views of its editorials and academically sound articles on Jain history, culture and society. His ''Jain Sāhitya aur Itihās'', is a collection of articles that he wrote for Jain Mitra and Jain Hitaiṣī, which set the benchmark for scholarly research into Jain history. <ref>He later re-edited these articles and produced a compilation, first published in 1942, and a second edition in 1956. His grandson Yashodhar's wife Vijayalakshmi helped him with the second edition.</ref> 

He also edited classics such as the ''Banārasīvilāsa'', ''Daulatapadasangraha'', ''Jinaśataka'' and ''[[Banarasidas|Ardha Kathānaka]]''. Premiji also edited and published ''Ardha Kathānaka'', ''Banārasīvilāsa'' and many other [[Digambara]] Jain works, including Ācārya [[Kundakunda|Kundakunda's]] ''Bārasa Anuvekkhā'' and Ācārya Amrtacandra's ''Puruṣāthadiddhyupāya''. He also edited and published for the first time, the [[Śvetāmbara]] classic ''Upamitibhavaprañcakathā.''}}

===Establishment of Hindi Grantha Ratnākara Kāryālaya===

On 24 September 1912, Premiji founded the publishing house ''Hindi Grantha Ratnākara Kāryālaya'' (now known as ''Hindi Granth Karyalay''), which was to become the foremost Hindi publishing house in India and is also the oldest bookstore in [[Mumbai]]. The first publication was a Hindi translation of John Stuart Mill's ''Liberty'', titled ''Svādhīnatā''  by Pandit Mahavir Prasad Dvivedi. He published almost the entire oeuvre of Sharatchandra Chattopadhyaya, the great Bengali writer and some works of [[Rabindranath Tagore]], such as ''Ānkh kī Kirkirī'', and ''Naukā Dūbī''. Premiji also published Hindi translations of the Gujarati writer KM Munshi, such as ''Gujarāt ke Nāth'' and ''Pātan kā Prabhutva''. Other famous woks published include Munshi Premchand's classic novel, ''Godān'' and short story collections titled ''Nava Nidhi'' and ''Sapta Saroj''. He also published works of new writers such as Hajariprasad Dvivedi, Jainendrakumar, Yashpal, Acharya Chatursen, and Pandit Sudarshan. He also published the Bengali plays of Dvijendra Lal Rai for the first time in Hindi.

In memory of Seth Manikchandra, Premiji established the ''Manikacandra Jaina Granthamālā'' wherein he published Jain scriptures, for the first time systematically edited by philologists. The ''Manikacandra Jaina Granthamālā'' published over 48 [[Digambara]] Jain texts, mostly written in [[Prakrit]], [[Apabhramsa|Apabhramśa]] or [[Sanskrit]]. He ran the Manikacandra Jaina Granthamālā on an honorary basis between 1915 and the 1950s selling all the books at cost price. When his health began to fail, it was decided to hand over the series to ''Bhāratīya Jñānapītha'' in [[Varanasi]].<ref> Unfortunately after that, the series came to a halt and none of its books are available today.</ref>

===Contribution to other Indian Languages===
{{IAST|Premiji was adept at several languages. One of his mentors, Pannalal Bakhliwal, taught him Bengali and on his own, he studied and mastered [[Gujarati]] and [[Marathi]]. His Sanskrit background helped him to learn Prakrit and Apabhramśa, His command of languages as well as grasp of Jain Philosophy resulted in requests for translation translation of ancient Jain texts. At the behest of the ''Srīmad Rājacandra Granthamālā'', he translated from Gujarati into Hindi [[Shrimad Rajchandra|Śrīmad Rājacandra's]] ''Moksamālā''. This translation was unique in that he translated the prose segments into prose and the poetry into verse form. He also translated Ācārya ''Amrtacandra's Puruṣārthasiddhyupāya'' from Sanskrit to Hindi.}}

===Social Reformer===

{{IAST|Under the editorship of Premiji, ''Jain Mitra'' became a progressive magazine challenging the Jain community to change with the times and give up its orthodoxy. ''Jain Mitra'' became a masthead for all those who wanted the Jain community to move forward. He was at the epicentre of this movement for social freedom, universal progress and modern education. He also began advocating widow remarriage. This was unheard of in the conservative Jain community of that time and there was much opposition. But other Jain reformers, such as Kṣullaka Ganeshprasadji Varni of [[Bundelkhand]], publicly backed Premiji. In 1914, Premiji and Varniji both addressed a rally at Sonagiri, a Digambara Jain place of pilgrimage in [[Bundelkhand]], where they publicly declared their support for widow remarriage. 

In 1946, a grand luncheon was organized in Kolkatta to commemorate the release of a festschrift in his honour, titled "Premī Abhinandana Grantha". However Premiji refused to attend as in that year Bengal had suffered a great famine and he could not accept the invitation for a grand luncheon when there were thousands of people in Bengal dying of starvation. <ref> ''Premī Abhinandana Grantha'', was edited by the Vedic scholar Dr Vasudev Sharan Aggarwal with messages by Indian luminaries such as Sir Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, Purushottamdas Tandon and Kaka Kalelkar was formally lauched in Kolkatta </ref>}}

==Premiji’s Legacy==

Under his tutelage, Hindi Grantha Ratnākara Kāryālaya became India's No. 1 publishers of Hindi literature. In recognition of his contributions to Indian literature, the acclaimed Hindi novelist Vishnu Prabhakar called Premiji the ''"Bhīsma Pitāmaha"'' of Hindi publishing. 

Premiji had suffered from asthma for a long time and passed away owing to old age on 30 January 1960. He left behind his daughter-in-law and two grandsons. His elder grandson, Yashodhar Modi, is continuing his legacy along with his son, Manish Modi. 

In Premiji's memory, his grandson Yashodhar Modi has started the Pandit Nathuram Premi Research Series. This series has published select volumes focusing on subjects as varied as Jainism, philosophy and yoga and published original texts by ancient and medieval Jain ascetics such as Kundakunda, Samantabhadra, Pūjyapāda, Joindu, Prabhācandra, Vādirāja, Bhāvadeva and many others, usually accompanied by a crisp translation in either Hindi or English. 

Also, highly respected modern scholars such as Premiji himself, Ludwig Alsdorf, Maurice Bloomfield, Willem Bollée and Jaykumar Jalaj have been and are being published in the Pandit Nathuram Premi Research Series.
