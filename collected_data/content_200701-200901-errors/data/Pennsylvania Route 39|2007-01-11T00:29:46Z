'''Pennsylvania Route 39''' ('''PA 39''') is an east-west route that begins at North Front Street, [[Susquehanna Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Susquehanna Township]] that ends at [[US 322]] and [[US 422]] at [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]].  It runs 20 miles and goes through [[Linglestown, Pennsylvania]].  PA 39 is one of the few state routes to end on a non-numbered road.  

==Route description==
===Western half===
The western half of PA 39 runs from North Front Street to Jonestown Road in [[West Hanover Township, PA|West Hanover Township]].  This section of PA 39 is known as Linglestown Road.  The road is heavily travelled, intersecting with several major local roads as well as two U.S. Roads, [[U.S. Route 22|US 22]] and [[U.S. Route 322|US 322]].  22/322 runs concurrent from [[I-81]] (only a mile south of PA 39) to [[Williamsport, PA]].

PA 39 passes through [[Linglestown, PA|Linglestown]], which is a village that has little autonomy from [[Lower Paxton Township, PA|Lower Paxton Township]] of which it is located in.  Between Linglestown and Jonestown Road (a four mile stretch) is mostly wood and farm land, which is being more and more turned into residential or commercial land.  In 2005, [[Central Dauphin High School]] moved from its old location in Harrisburg to its current location on Piketown Road.  Though a good distance away from PA 39 the school property starts at the corner of Linglestown and Piketown roads.

PA 39 intersects [[I-81]] at Exit 77.  Truck stops were built around the exit, and the area is heavily utilized by trucks.  West Hanover Township plans to upgrade the interchange to incorporate traffic lights at both lanes of travel on and off of I-81, as well as traffic lights at the truck stops.

Jonestown Road, where Linglestown Road becomes Hershey Road, is the end of the western section of PA Route 39.  It is only a few hundred feet from I-81.

===Eastern half===

The eastern half of PA 39 runs from Jonestown Road to 322/422 in Hershey.  Hershey Road was at one time mostly farm land, but since 2002, has become some what built up with many townhouses, villas, and houses.  Two large developments have been built with in 2 miles of each other, and one smaller development was built.

A shopping center is being built and is anchored by a [[Giant Food of Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Giant Foods]].  Giant opened in October 2005, and the smaller shops in the shopping center are still being built.  Several stores opened in July 2006.  

Four traffic lights were installed on this section of PA 39 in October 2005, two where one of the large developments (Hershey Meadows) was built, one at Grand View Road, the major route to [[Hummelstown, PA|Hummelstown]] which goes through Hummelstown and to the [[Hummelstown Bypass]].  The other traffic light is at Hanover Road, the route PA 39 once followed before being directed slightly north towards Hersheypark.

PA 39 intersects Hersheypark Drive at the parking lot for Hersheypark, as well as the [[Giant Center]].  The intersection was upgraded in 2002 when the Giant Center opened and the Hersheypark parking lot was renovated, and the main entrance of the parking lot was moved off Hersheypark Drive.  PA 39 turns to the right for 3 miles where it ends at 322/422.
