'''Coonoor''' (Tamil : குன்னூர் )is a city and a [[municipality]] in the [[Nilgiris District|Nilgiris district]]  in the state of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]. It is a small quiet hill town in the [[Nilgiris|Nilgiri hills]] in southern India. It has a reputation (shared by many Indian [[hill station]]s) for being a reality-defying idyllic [[Shangri-La]] of sorts. However, the growing networked economy, and the rampant influx of tourists to the region in the past few decades have eroded this image of Coonoor to some degree.

== Background ==
[[Image:CoonoorTownPanaroma20070421.jpg|thumb|300px|Coonoor town panorama]]The town is the second largest in the Nilgiri hills after [[Ooty]], the district head quarters. 
Coonoor’s dominant demographic is a healthy mix of religions, languages and cultures - caused by the tourists who decide to retire here, the Indian Army’s regimental headquarters and Staff College ([[DSSC]]) in neighboring [[Wellington Cantonment]], and the local boarding schools. Economic development of the town has at best been lopsided, with very little going towards the maintenance of the town.

==Local Economy==
Coonoor's economy relies on seasonal tourist traffic during the summer months, and on the [[tea]] industry year round.  
===Tea===
[[Image:Coonoor tea plantation.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Daily wage laborers plucking [[Tea]] at a [[Tea Garden]] in Coonoor.]]
The local populace almost entirely depends on the tea trade. The massive private tea plantations that surround the hills produce fresh green tea leaves which are picked, processed and packaged in bulk in local factories, for sale at auction houses in Coonoor, [[Coimbatore]] and [[Cochin]].


===Tourism===
The hills are among the more scenic spots in Tamil Nadu, and consequently attract enormous amounts of tourists during the hot Indian summer months. The town’s infrastructure often finds itself unable to handle the tourist inflow, and life turns especially chaotic when the local horticultural society holds its annual “Fruit Show” at the peak of the tourist season, hosted at Sim's Park. 

There are several scenic areas around Coonoor. Coonoor provides tourists with a panoramic view of Eastern and Western Ghats along with its ravines, valleys, and waterfalls. There are some classical viewpoints close to Coonoor notably Dolphin's Nose, Lamb's Rock and Lady Canning's Seat.

===Other Industry===
[[Image:PasteurInstituteCoonoor.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pasteur Institute, 1927]]
Coonoor is home to the [[Pasteur Institute of India]] [http://mohfw.nic.in/kk/95/ib/95ib0l01.htm] which produces [[rabies]] [[vaccine]]s. 

Coonoor has some [[Sericulture]]. The Government operates a Silk Farm, though this is largely a research facility. [[Floriculture]] and strawberry cultivation are taking root of late. 

=== Education===
Schools are a significant contributor to the local economy. The expensive boarding (residential) schools have for nearly a century now been a feature of the Nilgiris and Coonoor. Originally modelled as British vocational training centers, these have now become comprehensive Kindergarten - Higher Secondary (K-12) schools based on the Indian (Central or State) schooling systems. The pleasant climate and utopian ideas of children growing up away from the maddening rush of life attract parents from all over the world. The schools are generally very well equipped by Indian and International standards, and mostly cater to the Indian elite. However, since most schools are also open to locals, they don't always breed elitist values. Many of these schools are owned and operated by Catholic missionaries. The reasonable availability of infrastructure allows these schools to excel in sports, unlike most other schools in India which have a very strong academic focus. These schools include:

*[[St. Joseph's Boys School|St. Joseph's Boys Higher Secondary School, Coonoor]]

===Nilgiri Mountain Railway===
The [[Nilgiri Mountain Railway]] is one of the oldest [[mountain railway]]s in India. The Nilgiri Mountain Railway was declared by the [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]] in July [[2005]]. This railway links Coonoor to the town of [[Mettupalayam]] at the foot of the hills. Coonoor was the original termination point of this railway, before the line was extended to Ooty. 

===Road===
Coonoor is also linked by road to [[Mettupalayam, Coimbatore|Mettupalayam]]. The road which continues on to Ooty is one of the [[Nilgiri Ghat Roads]] and is one of the main access routes for the entire district. Another major road links Coonoor to [[Kotagiri]] via [[Bandishola]] and Bettati Tollgate and then this road links to State Highway 15 (going from Ooty to Kotagiri). 

'''The nearest international airport is at Coimbatore.'''

There are several other minor roads passing through Coonoor leading to outlying [[Nilgiri tea|Tea]] estates.
