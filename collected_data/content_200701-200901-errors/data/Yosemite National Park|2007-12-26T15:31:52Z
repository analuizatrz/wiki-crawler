'''Yosemite National Park''' (pronounced "yo-SEM-it-ee", {{IPAEng|joʊˈsɛmɨtiː}}) is a [[National Park Service|national park]] located largely in [[Mariposa County, California|Mariposa]] and [[Tuolumne County, California|Tuolumne Counties]], [[California]], [[United States]]. The park covers an area of 761,266&nbsp;acres or 1,189&nbsp;square miles (3,081&nbsp;km²) and reaches across the western slopes of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain chain.<ref>Harris, ''Geology of National Parks'' (5th ed), p. 324.</ref> Yosemite is [[Tourism in the United States|visited]] by over 3.5 million people each year, with most visitors only seeing the seven square miles (18&nbsp;km²) of [[Yosemite Valley]].<ref name="naturehistory"/> Designated a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1984, Yosemite is internationally recognized for its spectacular [[granite]] cliffs, [[waterfall]]s, clear [[stream]]s, [[Giant Sequoia]] groves, and [[biological diversity]].<ref name = "naturehistory">{{cite web | title =Nature & History | publisher = United States National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/nature.htm | date = [[October 13]], [[2006]] | accessdate = January 27 | accessyear = 2007 }}</ref> About 89% of the park is designated [[wilderness area|wilderness]]. Although not the first designated [[national park]], Yosemite was a focal point in the development of the national park idea, largely owing to the work of people like [[John Muir]].<ref name = "historyculture"/>

Yosemite is one of the largest and least fragmented [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] blocks in the Sierra Nevada, and the park supports a diversity of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s. The park has an elevation range from 2,000 to 13,114&nbsp;feet (600 to 4,000&nbsp;m) and contains five major [[life zone|vegetation zone]]s: [[chaparral]]/[[oak]] woodland, lower [[montane]], upper montane, [[Sierra Nevada subalpine zone|subalpine]], and [[alpine climate|alpine]]. Of California's 7,000 plant species, about 50% occur in the Sierra Nevada and more than 20% within Yosemite. There is suitable habitat or documentation for more than 160 rare plants in the park, with rare local geologic formations and unique [[soil]]s characterizing the restricted ranges many of these plants occupy.<ref name = "naturehistory"/>

The [[geology of the Yosemite area]] is characterized by granitic rocks and remnants of older rock. About 10 million years ago, the Sierra Nevada was uplifted and then tilted to form its relatively gentle western slopes and the more dramatic eastern slopes. The uplift increased the steepness of stream and river beds, resulting in formation of deep, narrow [[canyon]]s. About 1 million years ago, [[snow]] and [[ice]] accumulated, forming [[glacier]]s at the higher alpine meadows that moved down the river valleys. Ice thickness in Yosemite Valley may have reached 4,000&nbsp;feet (1200&nbsp;m) during the early glacial episode. The downslope movement of the ice masses cut and sculpted the U-shaped valley that attracts so many visitors to its scenic vistas today.<ref name="naturehistory"/>
==Geography==
[[Image:Jabathehutt.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral Lakes|Lower Cathedral Lake]]]]
Yosemite National Park is located in the central Sierra Nevada of [[California]]. It takes 3.5&nbsp;hours to drive to the park from [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and about 6&nbsp;hours from [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Yosemite is surrounded by wilderness areas: the [[Ansel Adams Wilderness]] to the southeast, the [[Hoover Wilderness]] to the northeast, and the [[Emigrant Wilderness]] to the north.

The 1,189&nbsp;sq mi (3,081&nbsp;km²) park contains thousands of [[lake]]s and [[pond]]s, 1,600&nbsp;miles (2,600&nbsp;km) of [[stream]]s, 800&nbsp;miles (1300&nbsp;km) of [[hiking]] trails, and 350&nbsp;miles (560&nbsp;km) of roads.<ref name="nature">{{cite web | title =Nature & Science | publisher =United States National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | url = http://www.nps.gov/yose/naturescience/index.htm | accessdate = January 27 | accessyear = 2007 }}</ref> Two federally designated [[Wild and Scenic River]]s, the [[Merced River|Merced]] and the [[Tuolumne River|Tuolumne]], begin within Yosemite's borders and flow westward through the Sierra foothills, into the [[California Central Valley|Central Valley of California]]. Annual park visitation exceeds 3.5&nbsp;million, with most visitor use concentrated in the seven square mile (18&nbsp;km²) area of [[Yosemite Valley]].<ref name="nature"/>

===Rocks and erosion===
Almost all of the [[landforms]] in the Yosemite area are cut from the [[granite|granitic]] rock of the [[Sierra Nevada Batholith]] (a [[batholith]] is a large mass of intrusive [[igneous rock]] that formed deep below the surface).<ref name="GeologyNP329">Harris, ''Geology of National Parks'' (5th ed), page 329</ref> About 5% of the park (mostly in its eastern margin near [[Mount Dana]]) are from [[metamorphic rock|metamorphosed]] [[volcanic rock|volcanic]] and [[sedimentary rock]]s.<ref name="landorms">{{cite web | publisher = United States National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/geo_landforms.htm | title = Geology: The Making of the Landscape  | date = [[December 22]], [[2004]] | accessdate =January 27 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref> These rocks are called ''roof pendants'' because they were once the roof of the underlying granitic rock.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = United States Geological Survey | url = http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/geology/publications/pp/160/sec2a.htm | title = Geological Survey Professional Paper 160: Geologic History of the Yosemite Valley - The Sierra Block  | date = [[November 28]] [[2006]] |accessdate = January 27 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref>

[[Image:joint plane on Lambert Dome-750px.jpg|thumb|Joint plane on [[Lembert Dome]]]]
[[Erosion]] acting upon different types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, [[dome (geology)|domes]], and other features we see today. These joints and fracture systems do not move, and are therefore not [[fault (geology)|faults]].<ref name="GeologyNP331">Harris, ''Geology of National Parks'' (5th ed.), p. 331.</ref> Spacing between joints is controlled by the amount of [[silica]] in the granite and [[granodiorite]] rocks; more silica tends to create a more resistant rock, resulting in larger spaces between joints and fractures.<ref name="GeologyUSP220">Kiver, ''Geology of U.S. Parklands'' (5th ed.), p. 220.</ref>

Pillars and columns, such as Washington Column and Lost Arrow, are created by cross joints. [[Erosion]] acting on master joints is responsible for creating valleys and later canyons.<ref name="GeologyUSP220"/> The single most erosive force over the last few million years has been large alpine [[glacier]]s, which have turned the previously V-shaped river-cut valleys into U-shaped glacial-cut canyons (such as [[Yosemite Valley]] and [[Hetch Hetchy Valley]]). [[Exfoliation (geology)|Exfoliation]] (caused by the tendency of [[crystal]]s in [[pluton]]ic rocks to expand at the surface) acting on granitic rock with widely spaced joints is responsible for creating domes such as [[Half Dome]] and [[North Dome]] and inset arches like Royal Arches.<ref name="GeologyNP332"/>

Yosemite Valley represents only one percent of the park area, but this is where most visitors arrive and stay. [[El Capitan]], a prominent granite cliff that looms over the valley, is one of the most popular [[rock climbing]] destinations in the world because of its diverse range of climbing routes in addition to its year-round accessibility. [[Granite dome]]s such as [[Sentinel Dome|Sentinel Rock]] and [[Half Dome]] rise 3,000&nbsp;feet and 4,800&nbsp;feet (900 and 1,450&nbsp;m), respectively, above the valley floor.

The high country of Yosemite contains beautiful areas such as [[Tuolumne Meadows]], [[Dana Meadows]], the [[Clark Range (California)|Clark Range]], the [[Cathedral Range]], and the [[Kuna Crest]]. The Sierra crest and the [[Pacific Crest Trail]] run through Yosemite, with peaks of red [[metamorphic rock]], such as [[Mount Dana]] and [[Mount Gibbs]], and [[granite]] peaks, such as [[Mount Conness]]. [[Mount Lyell (California)|Mount Lyell]] is the highest point in the park.

The park has three groves of ancient [[Giant Sequoia]] (''Sequoiadendron giganteum'') [[tree]]s; the [[Mariposa Grove]] (200 trees), the [[Tuolumne Grove]] (25 trees), and the [[Merced Grove]] (20 trees).<ref name="GeologyNP340"/> Giant Sequoia are the most massive trees in the world and are one of the tallest and longest-lived ([[Coast Redwood]]s that live along the [[Northern California]]n coast are the tallest and the [[Great Basin Bristlecone Pine]] of [[Eastern California]] are the oldest). These trees were much more widespread before the start of the last Ice Age.<ref name="Kiver227">Kiver, ''Geology of U.S. Parklands'' (5th ed), page 227</ref>

===Water and ice===
[[Image:Yosemite.JPG|thumb|left|270px|[[Merced River]] from Yosemite]]
[[Tuolumne River|Tuolumne]] and [[Merced River]] systems originate along the crest of the Sierra Nevada in the park and have carved river canyons 3,000 to 4,000&nbsp;feet (900 to 1,200&nbsp;m) deep. The Tuolumne River drains the entire northern portion of the park, an area of approximately 680 square miles (1,760&nbsp;km²). The Merced River begins in the park's southern peaks, primarily the [[Cathedral Range|Cathedral]] and [[Clark Range (California)|Clark Ranges]], and drains an area of approximately 511 square miles (1,320&nbsp;km²).<ref name = "water overview">{{cite web | title = Water Overview | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/water.htm | publisher = National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | date = [[December 22]], [[2004]] | accessdate = January 27 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref>

Hydrologic processes, including [[glaciation]], [[flooding]], and fluvial geomorphic response, have been fundamental in creating landforms in the park.<ref name = "water overview"/> The park also contains approximately 3,200 [[lake]]s (greater than 100 m²), two [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]], and 1,700&nbsp;miles (2,700&nbsp;km) of streams, all of which help form these two large [[Drainage basin|watershed]]s.<ref name = "hydrology">{{cite web | title = Hydrology and Watersheds | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/wtr_hydrology.htm | publisher = National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | date = [[December 22]], [[2004]] | accessdate = January 27 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref> [[Wetland]]s in Yosemite occur in valley bottoms throughout the park, and are often hydrologically linked to nearby lakes and rivers through seasonal flooding and groundwater movement. [[Meadow]] habitats, distributed at elevations from 3,000 to 11,000&nbsp;feet (900 to 3,500&nbsp;m) in the park, are generally wetlands, as are the [[riparian]] habitats found on the banks of Yosemite's numerous streams and rivers.<ref name = "wetland vegetation">{{cite web | title = Wetland Vegetation | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/veg_wetlands.htm | publisher = National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | date = [[December 22]], [[2004]] | accessdate = January 27 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref>

[[Image:Closeup of Bridalveil Fall seen from Tunnel View in Yosemite NP.JPG|thumb|[[Bridalveil Fall (Yosemite)|Bridalveil Fall]] flows from a U-shaped hanging valley that was created by a tributary glacier.]]
Yosemite is famous for its [[List of Yosemite waterfalls|high concentration of waterfalls]] in a small area. Numerous sheer drops, glacial steps and [[hanging valley]]s in the park provide many places for [[waterfall]]s to exist, especially during April, May, and June (the snowmelt season). Located in Yosemite Valley, the 2,425-foot-high (739&nbsp;m) [[Yosemite Falls]] is the highest in [[North America]]. Also in the valley is the much lower volume [[Ribbon Fall]]s, which has the highest single vertical drop, 1,612&nbsp;feet (492&nbsp;m).<ref name="Kiver227"/> Perhaps the most prominent of the Yosemite waterfalls is [[Bridalveil Fall (Yosemite)|Bridalveil Fall]], which is the waterfall seen from the Tunnel View viewpoint at the east end of the [[Wawona Tunnel]]. Wapama Falls in [[Hetch Hetchy Valley]] is another notable waterfall. Hundreds of [[ephemeral]] waterfalls also exist in the park.

All [[glacier]]s in the park are relatively small glaciers that occupy areas that are in almost permanent shade, such as north- and northeast-facing [[cirque (landform)|cirques]]. [[Lyell Glacier]] is the largest glacier in the Sierra Nevada (and therefore the park) and covers 160&nbsp;acres (65&nbsp;ha).<ref name="GeologyUSP228">Kiver, ''Geology of U.S. Parklands'' (5th ed.), p. 228.</ref> None of the Yosemite glaciers are a remnant of the much, much larger [[Ice Age]] alpine glaciers responsible for sculpting the Yosemite landscape. Instead, they were formed during one of the [[neoglacial]] episodes that have occurred since the thawing of the Ice Age (such as the [[Little Ice Age]]).<ref name="GeologyNP340">Harris, ''Geology of National Parks'' (5th ed.), p. 340.</ref> [[Global warming]] has reduced the number and size of glaciers around the world. Many Yosemite glaciers, including Merced Glacier, which was discovered by [[John Muir]] in 1871 and bolstered his glacial origins theory of the Yosemite area, have disappeared and most of the others have lost up to 75% of their surface area.<ref name="GeologyUSP228"/>

===Climate===
[[Image:El Capitan at fall.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Fall in Yosemite]]
Yosemite has a [[Mediterranean climate]], meaning most precipitation falls during the mild winter, and the other seasons are nearly dry (less than 3% of precipitation falls during the long, hot summers).<ref name="Wuerthner8">Wuerthner, ''Yosemite: A Visitor's Companion'' (1st ed.), p. 8.</ref> Due to [[orographic lift]], precipitation increases with elevation up to 8,000&nbsp;feet (2,400&nbsp;m) where it slowly decreases to the crest. Precipitation amounts vary from 36&nbsp;inches (915&nbsp;mm) at 4,000&nbsp;feet (1,200&nbsp;m) elevation to 50&nbsp;inches (1,200&nbsp;mm) at 8,600&nbsp;feet (2,600&nbsp;m). Snow does not typically persist on the ground until November in the high country. It accumulates all winter and into March or early April.<ref name="climate">{{cite web | publisher = National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/wtr_climate.htm | title = Climate | date = [[December 22]] [[2004]] | accessdate = January 27 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref>

Temperature decreases with increasing elevation. Temperature extremes are moderated by the fact that Yosemite is only about 100&nbsp;miles (160&nbsp;km) from the [[Pacific Ocean]]. An anticyclone sits off the coast of California in the summer, sending cool air masses toward the Sierra Nevada that result in clean dry air in the Yosemite area.

Mean daily temperatures range from 25 to 53&nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|°F]] (-3.9 to 11.5&nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]]) at Tuolumne Meadows at 8,600&nbsp;feet (2,600&nbsp;m). At the Wawona Entrance (elevation 5,130&nbsp;feet; 1,564&nbsp;m), mean daily temperature ranges from 36 to 67&nbsp;°F (2.2 to 19.4&nbsp;°C). At the lower elevations below 5,000&nbsp;feet (1525&nbsp;m), temperatures are hotter; the mean daily high temperature at Yosemite Valley (elevation 3,966&nbsp;feet; 1,209&nbsp;m) varies from 46 to 90&nbsp;°F (7.8 to 32.2&nbsp;°C). At elevations above 8,000&nbsp;feet (2,440&nbsp;m), the hot, dry summer temperatures are moderated by frequent summer [[thunderstorm]]s, along with snow that can persist into July. The combination of dry [[vegetation]], low relative [[humidity]], and thunderstorms results in frequent [[lightning]]-caused [[wildfire|fires]] as well.<ref name="climate"/>

===Ahwahneechee and the Mariposa Wars===
[[Image:Miwok-Paiute ceremony in 1872 at current site of Yosemite Lodge.jpeg|thumb|[[Paiute]] ceremony in 1872 at current site of Yosemite Lodge]]
[[Paiute]] and [[Valley and Sierra Miwok|Sierra Miwok]] peoples lived in the area for decades before the first white explorations into the region. A band of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] called the Ahwahneechee lived in [[Yosemite Valley]] when the first non-[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] people entered it.<ref name="Bunnell17">{{cite web | title = Discovery of the Yosemite and the Indian War of 1851 Which Led to That Event | last= Bunnell | first= Lafayette H.| url= http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/discovery_of_the_yosemite/17.html | chapter=Chapter 17 | | publisher = F.H. Revell | date = 1892 | accessdate=January 27|accessyear=2007 }} ISBN 0-93966-658-8.</ref>

The [[California Gold Rush]] in the mid-19th century dramatically increased white travel in the area. [[United States Army]] Major [[Jim Savage]] led the [[Mariposa Battalion]] into the west end of Yosemite Valley in 1851 while in pursuit of around 200 Ahwahneechees led by [[Chief Tenaya]] as part of the [[Mariposa Wars]].<ref name="GeologyNP326">Harris, ''Geology of the National Parks'' (5th ed.), p. 326.</ref> Accounts from this battalion were the first confirmed cases of Caucasians entering the valley. Attached to Savage's unit was Dr. [[Lafayette Bunnell]], the company [[physician]], who later wrote about his awestruck impressions of the valley in ''[[The Discovery of the Yosemite]]''. Bunnell is credited with naming the valley from his interviews with Chief Tenaya. Bunnell wrote that Chief Tenaya was the founder of the Pai-Ute Colony of Ah-wah-nee.<ref name="Bunnell17" /> The Miwoks (and most white settlers) considered the Ahwahneechee to be especially violent due to their frequent territorial disputes, and the Miwok word "yohhe'meti" literally means "they are killers".<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/origin_of_word_yosemite.html | title= Origin of the Word Yosemite | last=Anderson| first=Daniel E. | publisher = The Yosemite Web | date = July 2005 |accessdate = January 27 | accessyear=2007 }}</ref> Correspondence and articles written by members of the battalion helped to popularize the valley and surrounding area.

Tenaya and the rest of the Ahwahneechee were eventually captured and their village burned; they were removed to a [[Indian reservation|reservation]] near [[Fresno, California]]. Some were later allowed to return to the valley, but got in trouble after attacking a group of eight gold [[mining|miners]] in the spring of 1852.<ref name="Schaffer46">Schaffer, ''Yosemite National Park'' (4th ed.), p. 46.</ref> The band fled and took refuge with the nearby [[Mono tribe]]; but after stealing some horses from their hosts, the Ahwahneechees were tracked down and killed by the Monos. A reconstructed "Indian Village of Ahwahnee" is now located behind the Yosemite Museum, which is next to the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center.

===Early tourists===
Entrepreneur [[James Mason Hutchings]], artist [[Thomas Ayres]] and two others ventured into the area in 1855, becoming the valley's first tourists.<ref name="GeologyNP326"/> Hutchings wrote articles and books about this and later excursions in the area, and Ayres' sketches became the first accurate drawings of many prominent features. Photographer [[Charles Leander Weed]] took the first [[photograph]]s of the Valley's features in 1859.<ref name="GeologyNP326"/> Later photographers included [[Ansel Adams]].

[[Image:Wawona Hotel.jpg|thumb|150px|The [[Wawona Hotel]]]]
[[Wawona, California|Wawona]] was an Indian encampment in what is now the southwestern part of the park. Settler [[Galen Clark]] discovered the [[Mariposa Grove]] of [[Giant Sequoia]] in Wawona in 1857. Simple lodgings were built, as were roads to the area. In 1879, the [[Wawona Hotel]] was built to serve tourists visiting the Grove. As tourism increased, so did the number of trails and hotels.

===Yosemite Grant===
[[Image:Galen Clark in the Big Tree Grove.jpeg|thumb|100px|left|[[Galen Clark]]]]
Concerned by the effects of commercial interests, prominent citizens including [[Galen Clark]] and Senator [[John Conness]] advocated for protection of the area. A park bill passed both houses of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], and was signed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] on [[June 30]] [[1864]], creating the Yosemite Grant.<ref name="Schaffer48">Schaffer, ''Yosemite National Park'' (4th ed.), p. 48.</ref> This is the first instance of park land being set aside specifically for preservation and public use by action of the U.S. federal government, and set a precedent for the 1872 creation of [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] as the first [[national park]].<ref name = "historyculture">{{cite web | title = History & Culture | publisher = United States National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | url = http://www.nps.gov/yose/historyculture/index.htm | accessdate = January 27 | accessyear = 2007 }}</ref> Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove were ceded to [[California]] as a [[state park]], and a board of commissioners was proclaimed two years later. 

Galen Clark was appointed by the commission as the Grant's first guardian, but neither Clark nor the commissioners had the authority to evict [[Homestead Act|homesteaders]] (which included Hutchings).<ref name="Schaffer48"/> The issue was not settled until 1875 when the homesteader land holdings were invalidated. Clark and the reigning commissioners were ousted in 1880, and Hutchings became the new park guardian.<ref name="Schaffer49"/>

Access to the park by tourists improved in the early years of the park, and conditions in the Valley were made more hospitable. Tourism significantly increased after the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] was completed in 1869, but the long horseback ride to reach the area was a deterrent.<ref name="Schaffer48"/> Three [[stagecoach]] roads were built in the mid-1870s to provide better access for the growing number of visitors to the Valley.

[[Scotland|Scottish]]-born naturalist [[John Muir]] wrote articles popularizing the area and increasing scientific interest in it. Muir was one of the first to theorize that the major landforms in Yosemite were created by large alpine [[glacier]]s, bucking established scientists such as [[Josiah Whitney]], who regarded Muir as an amateur.<ref name="Schaffer49">Schaffer, ''Yosemite National Park'' (4th ed.), p. 49.</ref> Muir wrote scientific papers on the area's biology.

===Increased protection efforts===
[[Image:Muir and Roosevelt.jpg|thumb|[[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[John Muir]] on [[Glacier Point]] ]]
Overgrazing of [[meadow]]s (especially by [[sheep]]), [[logging]] of Giant Sequoia, and other damage caused Muir to become an advocate for further protection. Muir convinced prominent guests of the importance of putting the area under federal protection; one such guest was [[Robert Underwood Johnson]], editor of ''[[Century Magazine]]''. Muir and Johnson lobbied Congress for the Act that created Yosemite National Park on [[October 1]] [[1890]].<ref name="Schaffer50">Schaffer, ''Yosemite National Park'' (4th ed.), p. 50.</ref> The State of California, however, retained control of the Valley and Grove. Muir also helped persuade local officials to virtually eliminate grazing from the Yosemite High Country.

[[Image:Fallen Monarch and F Troop of US Cavalry.jpeg|thumb|left|Fallen Monarch and F Troop of U.S. Cavalry]]
The newly created national park came under the jurisdiction of the [[United States Army]]'s [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|Fourth Cavalry Regiment]] on [[May 19]] [[1891]], which set up camp in Wawona.<ref name="Schaffer50"/> By the late 1890s, sheep grazing was no longer a problem, and the Army made many other improvements. The Cavalry could not intervene to help the worsening condition of the Valley or Grove.

Muir and his [[Sierra Club]] continued to lobby the government and influential people for the creation of a unified Yosemite National Park. In May 1903, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] camped with Muir near [[Glacier Point]] for three days. On that trip, Muir convinced Roosevelt to take control of the Valley and the Grove away from California and return it to the federal government. In 1906, Roosevelt signed a bill that did precisely that.

===Later history===
[[Image:YosemiteBlackBearTagged wb.jpg|thumb|An [[American Black Bear]] with a conspicuous ear tag browsing on its natural foods in Yosemite Valley]]
The [[National Park Service]] was formed in 1916, and Yosemite was transferred to that agency's jurisdiction. [[Tuolumne Meadows Lodge]], [[Tioga Pass Road]], and campgrounds at Tenaya and Merced lakes were completed in 1916.<ref name="Schaffer52">Schaffer, ''Yosemite National Park'' (4th ed.), p. 52.</ref> Automobiles started to enter the park in ever-increasing numbers following the construction of all-weather highways to the park. The Yosemite Museum was founded in 1926 through the efforts of [[Ansel Franklin Hall]].<ref>National Park Service, ''Yosemite: Official National Park Handbook'', p. 117.</ref>

In 1903, a dam in the northern portion of the park was proposed. Located in the [[Hetch Hetchy Valley]], its purpose was to provide water and [[hydroelectric power]] to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. Preservationists like Muir and his [[Sierra Club]] opposed the project, while [[conservation ethic|conservationists]] like [[Gifford Pinchot]] supported it. In 1913, the U.S. Congress authorized the [[O'Shaughnessy Dam]] through passage of the [[Raker Act]].<ref name="Schaffer51">Schaffer, ''Yosemite National Park'' (4th ed.), p. 51.</ref>

More recently, preservationists persuaded Congress to designate 677,600 acres (2,742&nbsp;km²), or about 89% of the park, as the '''Yosemite Wilderness''' — a highly protected [[wilderness area]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://planning.nps.gov/wilderness/document/California%20Wilderness%20Act.pdf|title=PUBLIC LAW. 98-425|author=98th U.S. Congress|year=1994|accessdate=2007-02-09}}</ref> The Park Service has reduced artificial inducements to visit the park, such as the ''[[Yosemite Firefall|Firefall]]'', in which red-hot embers were pushed off a cliff near [[Glacier Point]] at night. [[Traffic congestion]] in Yosemite Valley during the summer months has become a concern. Plans to exclude all automobiles in the summer that are not registered at a hotel or campground within the valley have been investigated; this would put summer day-use visitors in the valley on a free shuttle bus system, on bicycles, or on foot.
====Yosemite Park & Curry Company====
{{seealso|Collins v. Yosemite Park & Curry Co.}}
In the early years of the park, different companies ran multiple hotels and resorts. These resorts included the [[Wawona Hotel]], the [[Yosemite Park Lodge]], and [[Camp Curry]], a tent cabin site in Yosemite Valley. The ''Yosemite Park & Curry Company'' was formed in 1925 to consolidate those often-competing concessions. The Park Service granted the newly formed company exclusive right to operate hotels, restaurants and most stores in Yosemite. Two years later, the new company was headquartered on the mezzanine level of its new hotel, The [[Ahwahnee]]. The Yosemite Park and Curry Company ran the concessions in the park for over 50 years until the company was sold in the late 1970s to United States Natural Resources (USNR) and a couple of years later to MCA which operated Universal Studios. During those ownership changes, the Curry Company name continued. In 1993, MCA was acquired by Matsushita.  Then Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan objected to a Japanese firm operating concessions in a U.S. national park, so to avoid delay of federal approval of the acquisition, Matsushita arranged for the sale of the concessions company, ownership of its concession properties was transferred to the federal government, and the Yosemite Park and Curry Co. name was retired.  The park concession contract is now operated by [[Delaware North Companies]] "Parks and Resorts" (the official concessionaire name in DNC Parks and Resorts @ Yosemite).

The area of the park was astride a [[passive continental margin]] during the [[Precambrian]] and early [[Paleozoic]].<ref name="GeologyNP328"/> Sediment was derived from continental sources and was deposited in shallow water. These rocks have since been [[metamorphic rock|metamorphosed]].

[[Image:General geologic map of Yosemite area.png|thumb|200px|Generalized geologic map of the Yosemite area (USGS image)]]
Heat generated from the [[Farallon Plate]] [[subduction|subducting]] below the [[North American Plate]] led to the creation of an [[island arc]] of volcanoes on the west coast of proto-[[North America]] between the late [[Devonian]] and [[Permian]] periods.<ref name="GeologyNP328">Harris, ''Geology of National Parks'' (5th ed.), p. 328.</ref> Later volcanism in the [[Jurassic]] intruded and covered these rocks in what may have been magmatic activity associated with the early stages of the creation of the [[Sierra Nevada Batholith]]. 95% of these rocks were eventually removed by uplifted-accelerated erosion.

The first phase of regional [[intrusion (geology)|pluton]]ism started 210 million years ago in the late Triassic and continued throughout the Jurassic to about 150 million years before present ([[Before Present|BP]]).<ref name="GeologyNP329"/> Around the same time, the [[Nevadan orogeny]] built the Nevadan mountain range (also called the Ancestral Sierra Nevada) to a height of 15,000&nbsp;feet (4500&nbsp;m). This was directly part of the creation of the Sierra Nevada Batholith, and the resulting rocks were mostly [[granite|granitic]] in composition and emplaced about 6&nbsp;miles (10&nbsp;km) below the surface.<ref name="GeologyNP337">Harris, ''Geology of National Parks'' (5th ed.), p. 337.</ref> The second major pluton emplacement phase lasted from about 120 million to 80 million years ago during the [[Cretaceous]].<ref name="GeologyNP329"/> This was part of the [[Sevier orogeny]].

Starting 20 million years ago (in the [[Cenozoic]]) and lasting until 5 million years ago, a now-extinct extension of [[Cascade Range]] [[volcano]]es erupted, bringing large amounts of igneous material in the area. These igneous deposits blanketed the region north of the Yosemite region. Volcanic activity persisted past 5 million years [[Before Present|BP]] east of the current park borders in the [[Mono Lake]] and [[Long Valley Caldera|Long Valley]] areas.

===Uplift and erosion===
[[Image:YosemitePark2_amk.jpg|thumb|200px|View over Yosemite Valley]]
Starting 10 million years ago, vertical movement along the Sierra fault started to uplift the Sierra Nevada. Subsequent tilting of the Sierra block and the resulting accelerated uplift of the Sierra Nevada increased the [[gradient]] of western-flowing streams.<ref name="GeologyNP339">Harris, ''Geology of National Parks'' (5th ed.), p. 339.</ref> The streams consequently ran faster and thus cut their valleys more quickly. Additional uplift occurred when major faults developed to the east, especially the creation of [[Owens Valley]] from [[Basin and Range]]-associated extensional forces. Uplift of the Sierra accelerated again about two million years ago during the [[Pleistocene]].

The uplifting and increased erosion exposed granitic rocks in the area to surface pressures, resulting in [[exfoliation (geology)|exfoliation]] (responsible for the rounded shape of the many domes in the park) and mass wasting following the numerous fracture joint planes (cracks; especially vertical ones) in the now solidified plutons.<ref name="GeologyNP332">Harris, ''Geology of National Parks'' (5th ed.), p. 332.</ref> Pleistocene glaciers further accelerated this process and the larger ones transported the resulting [[scree|talus]] and [[till]] from valley floors.

Numerous vertical joint planes controlled where and how fast erosion took place. Most of these long, linear and very deep cracks trend northeast or northwest and form parallel, often regularly spaced sets. They were created by uplift-associated pressure release and by the unloading of overlying rock via erosion.

===Sculpting by glaciers=== 

[[Image:Glacierpoint-view.jpg|thumb|right|View from Glacier Point]]

A series of [[glaciation]]s further modified the region starting about 2 to 3 million years ago and ending sometime around 10,000 [[Before Present|BP]]. At least four major glaciations have occurred in the Sierra Nevada, locally called the Sherwin (also called the pre-Tahoe), Tahoe, Tenaya, and Tioga.<ref name="GeologyNP339"/> The Sherwin glaciers were the largest, filling Yosemite and other valleys, while later stages produced much smaller glaciers. A Sherwin-age glacier was almost surely responsible for the major excavation and shaping of Yosemite Valley and other canyons in the area.

Glacial systems reached depths of up to 4000&nbsp;feet (1200&nbsp;m) and left their marks in the Yosemite area. The longest glacier in the Yosemite area ran down the Grand Canyon of the [[Tuolumne River]] for 60&nbsp;miles (95&nbsp;km), passing well beyond [[Hetch Hetchy Valley]]. Merced Glacier flowed out of Yosemite Valley and into the [[Merced River Gorge]]. Lee Vining Glacier carved Lee Vining Canyon and emptied into Lake Russel (the much-enlarged ice age version of [[Mono Lake]]). Only the highest peaks, such as [[Mount Dana]] and [[Mount Conness]], were not covered by glaciers. Retreating glaciers often left recessional [[moraine]]s that impounded lakes such as the 5.5&nbsp;mile (8.9&nbsp;km) long Lake Yosemite (a shallow lake that periodically covered much of the floor of Yosemite Valley).<ref name="GeologyNP333">Harris, ''Geology of National Parks'' (5th ed.), p. 333.</ref>

{{See|Ecology of the Sierra Nevada}}
===Habitats===
[[Image:Mule Deer near Wawona in YNP.jpeg|thumb|[[Mule deer]] near Wawona]]
With habitats ranging from thick foothill [[chaparral]] to expanses of alpine rock, Yosemite National Park supports over 250 species of [[vertebrate]]s, which include [[fish]], [[amphibia]]ns, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[mammal]]s. This high diversity of species is also the result of [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]] in Yosemite that are largely intact, compared to areas outside the park where various human activities have resulted in habitat degradation or destruction.<ref name = "wildlife">{{cite web | title = Wildlife Overview | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/nature/wildlife.htm | publisher = National Park Service: Yosemite Park Service | date = [[December 22]] [[2004]] | accessdate = January 27 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref>

Along much of Yosemite's western boundary, habitats are dominated by mixed [[coniferous forest]]s of [[Ponderosa Pine]], [[Sugar Pine]], [[Incense-cedar]], [[White Fir]], and [[Douglas Fir]], and a few stands of [[Giant Sequoia]], interspersed by areas of [[Black Oak]] and [[Live oak|Canyon Live Oak]]. A relatively high diversity of wildlife species are supported by these habitats, due to relatively mild, lower-elevation [[climate]] and the mixture of habitat types and plant species. Wildlife species typically found in these habitats include [[American Black Bear]], [[Bobcat]], [[Gray Fox]], [[Mule deer]], [[Mountain Kingsnake]], [[Gilbert's Skink]], [[Woodpecker|White-headed Woodpecker]], [[Brown Creeper]], [[Spotted Owl]], and a wide variety of [[bat]] species. In the case of bats, large snags are important as roost sites.<ref name = "wildlife"/>

[[Image:Golden-crested Ground Squirrel-750px.jpg|thumb|left|[[Golden-mantled Ground Squirrel]] on top of Lembert Dome]]
Going higher in elevation, the coniferous forests become purer stands of [[Fir|Red Fir]], [[Western White Pine]], [[Jeffrey Pine]], [[Lodgepole Pine]], and the occasional [[Foxtail pine]]. Fewer wildlife species tend to be found in these habitats, due to their higher elevation and lower complexity. Species likely to be found include [[Golden-mantled Ground Squirrel]], [[Chickaree]], [[Marten]], [[Steller's Jay]], [[Hermit Thrush]], and [[Northern Goshawk]]. Reptiles are not common, but include [[Rubber Boa]], [[western fence lizard]], and [[Northern Alligator Lizard]].<ref name = "wildlife"/>

As the landscape rises, trees become smaller and more sparse, with stands broken by areas of exposed [[granite]]. These include Lodgepole Pine, [[Whitebark Pine]], and [[Mountain Hemlock]] that, at highest elevations, give way to vast expanses of granite as treeline is reached. The climate in these habitats is harsh and the growing season is short, but species such as [[Pika]], [[Marmot|Yellow-bellied Marmot]], [[White-tailed Jackrabbit]], [[Clark's Nutcracker]], and [[Rosy Finch]] are adapted to these conditions. Also, the treeless alpine habitats are the areas favored by [[Sierra Nevada Bighorn Sheep]]. This species, however, is now found in the Yosemite area only around Tioga Pass, where a small, reintroduced population exists.<ref name = "wildlife"/>

At a variety of elevations, meadows provide important, productive habitat for wildlife. Animals come to feed on the green [[Poaceae|grasses]] and use the flowing and standing water found in many meadows. [[Predation|Predators]], in turn, are attracted to these areas. The interface between meadow and forest is also favored by many animal species because of the proximity of open areas for foraging and cover for protection. Species that are highly dependent upon [[meadow]] habitat include [[Great Gray Owl]], [[Willow Flycatcher]], [[Yosemite Toad]], and [[Mountain Beaver]].<ref name = "wildlife"/>

===Management issues===
Despite the richness of high-quality habitats in Yosemite, three species have become [[extinct]] in the park within historical time, and another 37 species currently have special status under either California or federal [[endangered species]] legislation. The most serious current threats to Yosemite's wildlife and the ecosystems they occupy include loss of a natural fire regime, [[exotic species]], [[air pollution]], [[habitat fragmentation]], and [[climate change]]. On a more local basis, factors such as [[road kill]]s and the availability of human food have affected some wildlife species.

[[Image:Carbear.jpg|frame|left|An [[American Black Bear]] breaking into a parked car]]
The black bears of Yosemite were once famous for breaking into parked cars to steal food. They were also an encouraged tourist sight for many years at the park's [[garbage dump]]s, where bears congregated to eat park visitors' garbage and tourists gathered to photograph the bears. Increasing encounters between bears and humans and increasing damage to property led to an aggressive campaign to discourage bears from relying on human food or interacting with people and their property. The open-air dumps were closed; all trash receptacles were replaced with [[bear-resistant food storage container|bear-proof]] receptacles; all campgrounds were equipped with bear-proof food lockers so that people would not leave food in their vehicles, which were easy targets for the powerful and resourceful bears. Because bears who show aggression towards people usually are eventually destroyed, park personnel have continued to come up with innovative ways to have bears associate humans and their property with unpleasant experiences, such as being hit with [[rubber bullet]]s.  Today, about 30 bears a year are captured and [[ear tag|ear-tagged]] and their [[DNA]] is sampled so that, when bear damage occurs, rangers can ascertain which bear is causing the problem.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/04/0423_wirebears.html | title= DNA to Help Identify "Problem" Bears at Yosemite | publisher= National Geographic | date = [[April 23]] [[2001]] | accessdate=January 4 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref>

Increasing [[ozone]] pollution is causing tissue damage to the massive [[Giant Sequoia]] trees in the park. This makes them more vulnerable to [[insect]] infestation and [[disease]]. Since the [[conifer cone|cones]] of these trees require fire-touched soil to [[germination|germinate]], historic [[Wildfire#fire suppression|fire suppression]] has reduced these trees' ability to reproduce. The current policy of setting [[prescribed fire]]s will hopefully help the germination issue.

[[Image:Yellow star thistle.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Plants such as this [[Star thistle|Yellow Star Thistle]] are competing with native plants in Yosemite.]]
Yosemite National Park has documented more than 130 non-native plant [[species]] within park boundaries. These non-native plants were introduced into Yosemite following the migration of early [[European colonization of the Americas|Euro-American]] settlers in the late 1850s. Natural and human-caused disturbances, such as wildland fires and construction activities, have contributed to a rapid increase in the spread of non-native plants. A number of these species aggressively invade and displace the native plant communities, resulting in impacts on the park's resources. Non-native plants can bring about significant changes in park ecosystems by altering the native plant communities and the processes that support them. Some non-native species may cause an increase in the fire frequency of an area or increase the available [[nitrogen]] in the soil that may allow more non-native plants to become established. Many non-native species, such as [[star thistle|Yellow Star Thistle]] (''Centaurea solstitialis''), are able to produce a long [[tap root]] that allows them to out-compete the native plants for available water.<ref name = "exotic">{{cite web | url= http://www.nps.gov/yose/nature/veg_exotics.htm | title= Exotic Plants | date = [[December 22]] [[2004]]| publisher= National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | accessdate= January 4 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref>

[[Bull thistle|Bull Thistle]] (''Cirsium vulgare''), [[Common Mullein]] (''Verbascum thapsus''), and [[Klamath Weed]] (''Hypericum perforatum'') have been identified as noxious [[pest (organism)|pests]] in Yosemite since the 1940s. Additional species that have been recognized more recently as aggressive and requiring control are Yellow Star Thistle, [[Sweet Clover]]s (''Melilotus'' spp.), [[Himalayan Blackberry]] (''[[Rubus discolor]]''), [[Cut-leaved Blackberry]] (''Rubus laciniatus'') and [[Periwinkle (plant)|Periwinkle]] (''Vinca major'').<ref name = "exotic"/>

==Activities==
[[Image:Yosemite shuttlebus.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Yosemite Hybrid Shuttle, Yosemite's free shuttle bus system]]
[[Image:Yosemitetram.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A open-air tram in the [[Yosemite Valley]]]]

Yosemite Valley is open year-round, but much of the remaining park is closed due to snow in late fall and does not re-open until mid to late spring. Open-air tours around Yosemite Valley and the [[Mariposa Grove]] of [[Giant Sequoia]]s are available. Many people enjoy short walks and longer hikes to waterfalls in Yosemite Valley, or walks amongst Giant Sequoias in the Mariposa, Tuolumne, or Merced Groves. Others like to drive or take a tour bus to [[Glacier Point]] (summer-fall) to see a spectacular view of Yosemite Valley and the high country, or drive along the scenic [[Tioga Road]] to [[Tuolumne Meadows]] (summer-fall) and go for a walk or hike.

Most people who enter the park stay just for the day, and only visit locations within Yosemite Valley that are easily accessible via their automobile (there is a [[United States dollar|US$]]20 per automobile user fee to enter the park<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/feesandreservations.htm | title = Fees and Reservations}} National Park Service: Yosemite National Park. Retrieved on October 27, 2007.</ref>). [[Traffic congestion]] in the valley is therefore a serious problem during the peak visiting season, summer. A free [[public transport|shuttle bus system]] operates year-round in the valley, and [[park ranger]]s encourage people to use this system since parking within the valley during the summer is often nearly impossible to find.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/trip/shuttle.htm | publisher = National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | title = Yosemite Valley Shuttle Bus | date = [[September 21]] [[2006]] | accessdate = January 4 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref> Almost all of the park, however, is highly-protected roadless [[wilderness]] that does not allow any [[motor vehicle|motorized vehicle]]s and requires permits for overnight stays.

In addition to exploring the natural features of the park, visitors can also learn about the [[natural history|natural]] and [[culture|cultural]] history of Yosemite at a number of facilities in the valley: the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center, the adjoining Yosemite Museum, and the Nature Center at Happy Isles. There are also two [[National Historic Landmark]]s: the LeConte Memorial Lodge (Yosemite's first public visitor center), and the world-famous [[Ahwahnee Hotel]].

===Hiking===
Over 800&nbsp;miles (1300&nbsp;km) of trails are available to hikers<ref name="naturehistory"/>—anything from the easy stroll, to the grueling hikes up several park mountains, to multiple-day [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpack trips]].

The park can be divided into 5 sections for the day-user—Yosemite Valley, Wawona/Mariposa Grove/ Glacier Point, Tuolumne Meadows, Hetch Hetchy, and [[Crane Flat]]/[[White Wolf]]. Numerous books describe park trails, and free information is available from the Park Service in Yosemite. Most park workers strongly encourage guests to experience portions of the park other than Yosemite Valley.

Between late spring and early fall, much of the park is open to multiple-day backpack trips. All overnight trips into the back country require a wilderness permit<ref name = "permits"/> and most require approved [[bear-resistant food storage container|bear-resistant food storage]].<ref name = "food storage">{{cite web | publisher = National Park Service: National Park Service | last = Roberts | first = Hayes | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/wilderness/bfoodstorage.htm | title = Food storage | date = [[January 9]] [[2007]] | accessdate = January 27 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref>

===Biking===
Bicycle rentals are available in Yosemite Valley spring through fall. Over 12 miles of paved bike paths are available in Yosemite Valley. In addition, bicyclists can ride on regular roads. [[Bicycle helmet|Helmets]] are required by law for children under 18 years of age. Off-trail riding and [[mountain biking]] are not permitted in Yosemite National Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/pphtml/planyourvisit.html|title=Plan Your Visit|work=Yosemite National Park|publisher=U.S. National Park Service}}</ref>

===Driving destinations===
{{See|List of Yosemite destinations}}
While some locations in Yosemite require hiking, other locations can be observed via automobile transportation. Driving locations also allow guests to observe the night sky in locations other than their campsite or lodge. All of the roads in Yosemite are scenic, but the most famous is the [[Tioga Road]], typically open from late May or early June through November.<ref name = "auto touring">{{cite web | publisher = National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | title = Auto Touring | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/trip/touring.htm | date = [[December 22]] [[2004]] | accessdate = January 27 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref>

As an alternative to driving, bicycles are allowed on the roads.  However, bicycles are only allowed off-road on 12&nbsp;miles of paved trails in Yosemite Valley itself; mountain biking is not allowed.<ref name="bike">{{cite web | title= Biking | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/trip/biking.htm | publisher = National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | date = [[September 21]] [[2006]] | accessdate = January 27 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref>

===Climbing===
[[Rock climbing]] is an important part of Yosemite.<ref name="climbing">{{cite web | last = Roberts | first = Hayes | title = Climbing | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/wilderness/climbing.htm | publisher = National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | date = [[May 10]] [[2006]] | accessdate = January 27 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref> [[Camp 4 (Yosemite)|Camp 4]]—a walk-in campground in Yosemite Valley—was instrumental in the development of rock climbing as a sport, and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name = "camp4">{{cite press release | title = Camp 4 Listed With National Register of Historic Places | publisher = National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | date = [[February 27]] [[2003]] | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/news/2003/camp0227.htm | accessdate = January 27 | accessyear = 2007 }}</ref> Climbers can generally be spotted in the snow-free months on anything from ten-foot-high (3&nbsp;m) boulders to the 3,300&nbsp;foot (1&nbsp;km) face of [[El Capitan]]. Classes are offered by numerous groups on rock climbing.

===Winter activities===
[[Image:Yosemite Winter Hiking.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A ranger-guided [[snowshoe]] walk in the park]]
Many of the roads in the park close due to heavy snow in winter; however, Yosemite Valley is open all year long. [[Downhill skiing]] is available at the [[Badger Pass Ski Area]]—the oldest downhill skiing area in California, offering downhill skiing from mid-December through early April.<ref name="skiing">{{cite web |url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/trip/skiing.htm | title= Skiing | publisher = National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | date = [[September 21]] [[2006]] | accessdate = January 27 | accessyear = 2007 }}</ref> Much of the park is open to [[cross-country skiing]] and [[snowshoe]]ing, with several backcountry ski huts open for use.<ref name = "TuolumneWinter">{{cite web | publisher = National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | title = Tuolumne Meadows Winter Conditions Update | url = http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/tm.htm | accessdate = January 27 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref><ref name= "winter">{{cite web | publisher = National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | last = Roberts | first = Hayes | title = Winter Wilderness Travel | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/wilderness/winter.htm | date = [[December 22]] [[2004]] | accessdate = January 27 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref> Wilderness permits are required for backcountry overnight ski trips.<ref name = "permits">{{cite web | last = Roberts | first = Hayes | title = Permits | publisher = National Park Service: Yosemite National Park | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yose/wilderness/permits.htm | date = [[January 17]] [[2006]] | accessdate = January 27 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref>

The [[Bracebridge dinner]] is an annual holiday event, held since 1927 at the [[Ahwahnee Hotel]], inspired by [[Washington Irving]]'s descriptions of Squire Bracebridge and [[England|English]] [[Christmas]] traditions of the 1700s in his ''Sketch Book''. Between 1929 and 1973, the show was organized by [[Ansel Adams]].<ref name="Bracebridge">{{cite news | title = Ansel Adams' love of Yosemite lives | url = http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061226/ENT/612260312/1091/ENT | date = [[December 26]] [[2006]] | publisher = The Cincinnati Enquirer | accessdate = January 27 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref>
