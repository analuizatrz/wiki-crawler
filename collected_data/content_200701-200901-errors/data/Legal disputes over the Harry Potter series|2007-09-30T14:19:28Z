The '''''[[Harry Potter]]''''' books by [[J. K. Rowling]] have engendered a number of '''legal disputes''' since their publication. Civil liberties and free speech campaigners have decried certain actions taken by Rowling and her publishers, asserting that they and [[Time Warner]] have been needlessly overzealous in defence of copyright. Other legal disputes have drawn more sympathy for Rowling, particularly her defence against an author's fraudulent claim of copyright and trademark infringement, and in her attempts to stop illegally copied or counterfeit versions of her works from being sold. In other cases, attempts to preserve the secrecy over the plots of future books have led to a much-contested legal injunction and even to a criminal conviction. [[Bloomsbury Publishing]] also came close to legal action against the supermarket chain [[Asda]] for libel after the company accused them of overpricing the final ''Harry Potter'' novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''.

== Allegations of copyright and trademark infringement==

===Nancy Stouffer===
In 1999, [[United States|American]] onetime author '''Nancy Stouffer''' quietly began to allege [[copyright]] and [[trademark]] [[infringement]] by Rowling of her 1984 works ''The Legend of Rah and the Muggles'' and ''Larry Potter and His Best Friend Lilly''.<ref name="Potter author zaps court rival">{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/UK/09/19/rowling.court/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|title=Potter author zaps court rival|date=2002-09-19|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref>   

The primary basis for Stouffer's case rested in her own purported invention of the word "Muggles", non-magical elongated [[humanoids]] of sorts, in ''The Legend of Rah and the Muggles'', and Larry Potter, the title character of a series of activity booklets for children. Larry Potter is a bespectacled boy with dark, wavy hair. Rowling's Potter is characterised as having all of those qualities, though with unruly instead of wavy hair. Despite the confused reports of some news sites,<ref>{{cite web|title=Larry Potter returns to print|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1224264.stm|year=2001|accessdate=2007-06-11}}</ref> Larry Potter is not a character in ''The Legend of Rah and the Muggles'';  Stouffer contended, and still does to this day, that it is "the cumulative effect of all of it combined" with the other comparisons she lists on her website.<ref name="Muggle Versus Wizard">{{cite news|url=http://discuss.washingtonpost.com/zforum/01/author_stouffer032801.htm|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|title=Muggle Versus Wizard|date=2001-03-28|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> Stouffer's books were only available for sale in the eastern United States between 1986 and 1987, and none were sold.<ref name=appeal>{{cite web|title=SCHOLASTIC, INC., J.K.

Rowling, along with [[Scholastic Press]] (her American publisher) and [[Warner Bros.]] (holders of the series' film rights), pre-empted Stouffer with a suit of their own seeking a declaratory judgment that they had not infringed on any of Stouffer's works. During the course of the trial, it was proven "by clear and convincing  evidence, that Stouffer has perpetrated a fraud on the Court through her submission of fraudulent documents as well as through her untruthful testimony,"<ref name=appeal /> including changing pages years after the fact to retroactively insert the word "muggle".<ref name=appeal /><ref name=nancy>{{cite web|title=HPANA: Nancy Stouffer ruling upheld|url=http://www.hpana.com/news.17860.html|year=2004|accessdate=2007-04-06}}</ref>

Her case was dismissed with prejudice and she was fined $50,000 for her "pattern of intentional bad faith conduct" in relation to her employment of fraudulent submissions, along with being ordered to pay a portion of the plaintiffs' legal fees.<ref name="Stouffer v.

===Claire Field===
In 2000, in the lead-up to the release of the first ''Harry Potter'' film, [[Warner Bros.]], the film's distributor, sent a series of threatening letters to owners of ''Harry Potter'' fansites, demanding that, to protect their copyright, they hand over their domain names. The action resulted in negative publicity for the company when Claire Field, the then 15-year-old webmaster of the British fansite [http://www.harrypotterguide.co.uk/ harrypotterguide.co.uk], was reduced to tears by what were described by her father as unnecessary bully tactics. Eventually the corporation backed down in the face of media opposition and declared that, as the site was non-commercial, it didn't violate their trademark.<ref>{{cite web|title=Warner Brothers bullying ruins Field family Xmas|author=Kieren McCarthy|work=The Register|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2000/12/21/warner_brothers_bullying_ruins_field/ |year=2000|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Warner Bros backs down on Harry Potter Web site|author=Kieren McCarthy|work=The Register|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2000/12/15/warner_bros_backs_down/ |year=2000|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref>

===Various Chinese publishing houses===
In [[2002]], an unauthorised [[Chinese language|Chinese-language]] sequel entitled [[Harry Potter and Leopard-Walk-Up-to-Dragon]] appeared for sale in the [[People's Republic of China]]. The work of a Chinese [[ghostwriter]], the book contains the [[verbatim]] text of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and characters from the works of other authors, including the title character from [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]''. Rowling's lawyers successfully took legal action against the publishers, who were forced to pay damages.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2092661.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|title=Fake Harry Potter novel hits China|date=2002-07-04|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> Also in 2002, the China Braille Publishing House published ''Harry Potter and the Porcelain Doll''. It is estimated that there are fifteen million phoney ''Harry Potter'' novels circulating in China today.<ref name=China>{{cite web|title=What is the seventh Potter book called in China?|author=Howard W French|work=International Harald Tribune|year=2007|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/08/01/asia/01china.php|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref>
In 2007, [[Christopher Little Literary Agency|Christopher Little]], Rowling's literary agents, began to discuss the possibility of legal proceedings concerning a fake version of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' that appeared in China ten days before the actual book's publication.<ref name=China />

===Dimitry Yemets===
In 2003, courts in the [[Netherlands]] prevented the distribution of a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] translation of ''[[Tanya Grotter]] and the Magical Double Bass'', the first of [[Dimitry Yemets]]' popular [[Russian language|Russian]] series about a female apprentice wizard, [[Tanya Grotter]]. Rowling and her publishers sued, arguing that the Grotter books violate [[copyright]] law. Yemets and his original [[Moscow]]-based publishers, [[Eksmo]], argued that the books constitute a parody, permitted under copyright. The Dutch courts ruled that the books did not constitute parody and thus were not allowed to be translated or sold outside Russia.<ref><span class="plainlinks"> [http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/print/news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2846105.stm "Rowling seeks 'Grotter' ban"].

Later that year, as the Dutch translation ''Tanja Grotter en de magische contrabas'' was still legal in Belgium, the [[Flemish Region|Flemish]] publishers Roularta Books decided to print 1,000 copies (and no more) in order to let people decide whether it was [[plagiarism]], hoping that under those circumstances Rowling and her publishers would not sue.<ref>[http://www.nieuws.nl/bericht/4/40972 'Tanja Grotter' wel in België te lezen], ''Nieuws.nl'', October 23, 2003</ref> Rowling did not sue, but as there was a lot of interest in the book (Dutch people could buy the book by postal order from another Flemish publisher, Boekhandel VanIn) it was soon sold out.

The books remain popular in Russia and have spawned several sequels, as well as numerous merchandise and adaptations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter triumphs over Russians|work=Briffa creative law|url=http://www.briffa.com/news/art57potter.htm|year=2003|accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>At least ten recognised [[Harry Potter parodies]] are in circulation today, and have not faced legal injunction from Rowling or her publishers.

===Preventive Maintenance Monthly===
In their May, 2004 issue, the [[US Army]] publication the [[Preventive Maintenance Monthly]], which instructs soldiers on how to maintain their equipment, featured a spoof comic based on ''Harry Potter'', featuring a character named Topper who resided at Mogmarts School under Professor Rumbledore.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Preventive Maintenance Monthly|year=2004|url=https://www.logsa.army.mil/pub/psissues/PS_618.pdf|accessdate=2007-09-08}}</ref>  The publication received notice from Rowling's lawyers that the comics breached copyright, though the magazine's editor, Ken Crunk, claimed that no violation had taken place, as "The drawings do not look like any of the characters from Harry Potter"<ref>{{cite web|title=Army mag draws Potter comparisons|year=2005|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4243145.stm|accessdate=2007-09-08}}</ref>

===Wyrd Sisters===
In 2005, after being offered CAD$50,000 by [[Warner Brothers]], Canadian folk band The [[Wyrd Sisters (band)|Wyrd Sisters]] undertook a legal action against [[Warner Brothers]], [[Jarvis Cocker]] of [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]], and [[Jonny Greenwood]] and [[Phil Selway]] of [[Radiohead]], because of a scene in the ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' movie adaptation. In [[J.K. Rowling]]'s novel a band called the "Weird Sisters" plays at a special event in the story. Warner Brothers had considered using the name "The Weird Sisters" in the movie version of that scene.  While negotiations to share the name with the Atlanta based band "Three Weird Sisters" were met with enthusiasm, similar negotiations between Warner Brothers and the "Wyrd Sisters" quickly broke down, and all plans to use the name in the movie were abandoned. Despite that decision, the Canadian band filed a CAD$40-million lawsuit against Warner in Ontario court, which included an attempt to block distribution of the film in Canada. The entire suit was dismissed in November, 2005. Additionally, in June, 2006, the band was ordered to pay Warner Bros. CAD$140,000  in legal costs stemming from the group's lawsuit.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/story/arts/national/2005/11/04/Arts/wyrdlawsuit_051104.html|title='Wyrd Sisters' cannot stop Harry Potter| publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=bc5b3049-56dc-493b-9ccc-5d4bd0389392|title='Winnipeg folk band that took on Harry Potter ordered to pay $140,000 court costs|publisher=Canada.com National Post}}</ref>

===eBay===
In 2007, Rowling launched a series of lawsuits against a number of users of the auction site [[eBay]], alleging that they were selling illegally created [[e-books]] of her work.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter author fights e-book fraud on eBay|author=Candace Lombardi|work=c:net|url=http://news.com.com/2061-10802_3-6162935.htmlyear=2007|accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>

==Legal injunctions==
There have been a series of legal injunctions brought by Rowling and her publishers to ensure the books' secrecy before their launch. In their potentially sweeping powers over individual freedoms, these injunctions have drawn criticism from [[civil liberties]] campaigners.

In 2003, Rowling and her publishers sought and got a groundbreaking injunction against “the person or persons who has or have physical possession of a copy of the said book or any part thereof without the consent of the Claimants”<ref name=injunction>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter and the Injunctions against Trespassers|work=Winterbotham's Solicitors|url=http://www.winterbothams.com/pages/news_article.php?id=24|year=2004|accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref>. The ruling obtained, for the first time  in British law, an injunction against unnamed or unknown individuals; before then, injunctions could only be obtained against named individuals. This principle was later used to stop a demonstration and the growth of a gypsy site.<ref name=injunction /> In 2006, pharmaceutical company [[GlaxoSmithKline]] employed the injunction against anonymous animal rights campaigners who had sent threatening letters to their investors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Animal extremists can no longer hide behind a web of secrecy|author=Dan Tench|work=Timesonline|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article722258.ece|year=2006|accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref>

The series garnered more controversy in 2005 with its sixth release, ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', when a [[Real Canadian Superstore]] grocery store accidentally sold several copies of the sixth Harry Potter book before the authorised release date. The Canadian publisher, [[Raincoast Books]], obtained an [[injunction]] from the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]] prohibiting the purchasers from reading the books in their possession. This sparked a number of news articles questioning the injunction's restriction on fundamental rights. Solicitors Fraser Milner and Casgrain have rebutted this in their analysis of the case, saying that the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] applies only to the government, not to private litigation, and does not offer any protection of the right to read in any case, and the innocent purchasers of the ''Harry Potter'' book had no more right to read it than if they had come into possession of someone's secret diary.<ref>{{cite web|title=Understanding the Harry Potter Injunction: Protecting Copyright and Confidential Information|author=Barbara Grossman, Aaron Milrad and Annie Na|work=Fraser Milner and Casgrain|url=http://www.fmc-law.com/upload/en/publications/20052006/655380_HarryPotterInjunction_October21_2005.pdf|year=2005|accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref>  [[Richard Stallman]] posted a statement on his blog calling for a boycott until the publisher issues an apology.<ref name="Don't Buy Harry Potter Books">{{cite news|url=http://stallman.org/harry-potter.html|title=Don't Buy Harry Potter Books|date=2005-07-13|accessdate=2007-03-13|last=Stallman|first=Richard}}</ref>

In 2007, [[Scholastic Corporation]] threatened legal action against two booksellers, Levy Home Entertainment and DeepDiscount.com, for selling copies of the final novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' before its release date of July 21. In an official statement,  Scholastic made an appeal "to the Harry Potter fans who bought their books from DeepDiscount.com and may receive copies early requesting that they keep the packages hidden until midnight on July 21st."<ref>{{cite web|title=Scholastic will take action against Harry Potter distributors|work=Reuters|year=2007|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070718/media_nm/scholastic_harrypotter_dc_1;_ylt=AvVNO5KxE6R2vS5hZzA0WgtY24cA|accessdate=2007-07-18}}</ref>
Customers who agreed not to read the book received a special Harry Potter t-shirt and a $50 coupon for Scholastic's online store.

==Criminal prosecution==
In June 2005, Aaron Lambert, a security guard at a book distribution centre in [[Corby]], [[Northamptonshire]], [[England]], stole a number of pages from ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' six weeks before its intended publication date. He was arrested a day later after negotiations to sell them to John Askill, a journalist from ''[[The Sun]]'', went bad - Lambert reportedly fired a shot from his imitation [[Walther PPK]] pistol, though Mr. Askill was unharmed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guard admits to Harry Potter theft|work=JR Roberts Security Strategies|url=http://www.jrrobertssecurity.com/security-news/security-crime-news0082.htm|year=2005|accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref>  At his trial the following October, Lambert pleaded guilty to threatening Mr. Askill, and also to attempting to blackmail ''Harry Potter'''s publishers, [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Potter book thief admits threats|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/northamptonshire/4546164.stm|work=BBC News|year=2005|accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref> In January 2006, Lambert was sentenced to four and a half years in prison.<ref>{{cite web|title= Harry Potter thief sent to prison|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_4620000/newsid_4628100/4628144.stm|year=2006|work=CBBC Newsround|accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref>

==Libel threat==
In July 2007, a dispute arose between ''Harry Potter'''s British publisher, [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]], and [[Asda]], a British supermarket chain owned by the US corporation [[Wal-Mart]]. On July 15, a week before the release of the final ''Harry Potter'' novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Asda, which planned to sell the book as a [[loss leader]] at £8.87, or half Bloomsbury's [[recommended retail price]] of £17.99 and below the [[wholesale]] price of £9.89,<ref>{{cite web|title=Potter book firm clashes with supermarket over price|work=TimesOnline|year=2007|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article2089458.ece|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref>  issued a press release accusing Bloomsbury of unfairly fixing their prices. Asda spokesman Peter Pritchard claimed that Bloomsbury was "holding children to ransom" and that, "It seems like Bloomsbury need to do a [[Quidditch|quid-ditch]] as they have sent their prices up north on the [[Hogwarts Express]]. By setting the RRP at this level can only be seen [sic] as blatant profiteering on their part."<ref name=telegraph>{{cite web|title=Asda barred from selling seventh Harry Potter|author=Nigel Reynolds|work=The Telegraph|year=2007|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/07/17/npotter117.xml|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref> Pritchard went on to say that Asda were acting to "champion the right of young readers," and that the RRP was "twice the average child's pocket money and £5 more than the average children's bestseller."<ref name=telegraph /> 

Two days later, Bloomsbury responded that the claims were "potentially libellous" and that "Asda's latest attempt to draw attention to themselves involves trying to leap on the ''Harry Potter'' bandwagon. This is just another example of their repeated efforts of appearing as [[Robin Hood]] in the face of controversy about their worldwide group, which would suggest they are perceived as more akin to the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]]. Loss leaders were invented by supermarkets and have nothing to do with Bloomsbury Publishing or ''Harry Potter'' and we deeply regret having been dragged into their price-wars."<ref name=telegraph /> They stated that the price hike of £1 from the previous ''Harry Potter'' novel was due to it having been printed on recycled paper. "There is a price to be paid by the consumer for environmental best practice," a Bloomsbury spokeswoman said.<ref name=makepeace>{{cite web|title=Bloomsbury: Asda must make peace|author=Katherine Rushton|work=thebookseller.com|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/42122-bloomsbury-asda-must-make-peace.html|year=2007|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref>

Bloomsbury CEO Nigel Newton said, "They've unleashed a very disingenuous, self-interested attack on us. This is complete nonsense and all they're doing is grandstanding as they've done on the price of aspirin and bread. They try to turn it into a big deal as though it's a moral crusade for them, but it's nothing of the kind."<ref name=makepeace />

That same day, Bloomsbury cancelled all Asda's orders of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', or roughly 500,000 copies, citing unpaid bills from the company totalling £38,000 for unauthorised returns of the sixth ''Harry Potter'' book.<ref name=makepeace /> "The two matters are completely unrelated," said a Bloomsbury spokeswoman, "We decided today that we couldn't risk having arrears with anybody."<ref name=telegraph /> The dispute had been "going on a while - going on for weeks actually."<ref name=lifestyle>{{cite web|title=Asda Apologises following Potter Book Row|work=UK News Lifestyle Extra|url=http://www.lse.co.uk/ShowStory.asp?story=BZ1739815T&news_headline=asda_apologises_following_potter_book_row__|year=2007|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref> Asda responded that Bloomsbury owed them £122,000 ("for pulping and for other book trade issues and work we have done for them"<ref name=makepeace />) and that, as one company spokesman claimed, "It just seems funny that after we expose the potty Potter price hike, Bloomsbury are trying everything they can to stop kids getting hold of ''Harry Potter'' at a price they can afford."<ref name=lifestyle /> 

Asda paid the bill within hours, and claimed that Bloomsbury would be in breach of contract if it did not allow the store to sell its books. However, Bloomsbury claimed that the block on Asda's orders was still in place as, "Unfortunately, we've now had to initiate a significant libel claim against them. That matter will have to be dealt with. If they want their 500,000 books, they'll have to come and make peace with us... It could be good news for all their disappointed customers, because they don't have to go to a soulless Asda shed to buy their book and they can share the magic of Harry Potter at an independent or specialist bookstore instead."<ref name=makepeace /> 

Upon receipt of Bloomsbury's legal letter, Asda responded that, "There is nothing defamatory in our press release. Everything there is factual. It is a commentary on how we see things."<ref name=makepeace /> Said another Asda spokesperson, "If they don't supply us with the books, it will have a massive implication and [be] a breach of contract - but I don't think they will do that."<ref name=makepeace />

Later that day, however, Asda released a statement retracting its original comment: "We apologise unreservedly to Bloomsbury for [our] press release dated July 15 and withdraw our statement. We look forward to a good relationship with Bloomsbury going forward, including selling the latest ''Harry Potter'' book from 00:01am BST on Saturday 21 July and many other Bloomsbury books in the future".<ref name=standoff>{{cite web|title=The Great Stand-Off|author=Ralph Baxter|work=Publishing News Online|url=http://www.publishingnews.co.uk/pn/pno-news-display.asp?K=e2007071912471094&TAG=&CID=&PGE=&sg9t=...|year=2007|accessate=2007-08-01}}</ref> In response, Bloomsbury lifted the block and Asda was allowed to sell its books. The original press release was then expunged.<ref name=guardian>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter and the Asda Apology|author=Graeme Warden|work=Guardian Unlimited|year=2007|url=http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,2128240,00.html|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref> 

The rationale behind Asda's initial press release remains uncertain.  Neill Denny, commentator for thebookseller.com, opined that "the whole episode has the whiff of a badly-conceived PR stunt by ill-briefed senior executives at Asda out of touch with the subtleties of the book world."<ref name=Denny>{{cite web|title=Opinion: Asda's climbdown|author=Neill Denny|work=thebookseller.com|year=2007|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/42197-opinion-asdas-climbdown.html|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref>   Ralph Baxter of Publishing News concurred: "For Asda... it may be seen as mission accomplished, a high-risk strategy to maximise publicity for its ''Harry Potter'' offer rewarded with television, radio, internet and newspaper coverage. And the association of Asda with low prices has no doubt been entrenched in a few more minds."<ref name=standoff />
