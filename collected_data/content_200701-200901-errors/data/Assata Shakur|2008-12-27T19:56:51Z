Shakur was arrested for the first time in 1967 (along with 100 other Manhattan Community College students) on charges of [[trespass]]ing, after the students chained and locked the entrance to a college building, protesting what they alleged to be a curriculum deficient in [[Africana studies|Black Studies]] and a lack of black faculty.<ref>Williams, 1993, p. 7.</ref> She married Louis Chesimard, a fellow student-activist at CCNY, in April 1967 and divorced him in December 1970.

:"The basic problem stemmed from the fact that the BPP had no systematic approach to political education. They were reading the [[Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong|Red Book]] but didn't know who [[Harriet Tubman]], [[Marcus Garvey]], and [[Nat Turner]] were. They talked about intercommunalism but still really believed that the [[American Civil War|Civil war]] was fought to free the slaves. A whole lot of them barely understood any kind of history, Black, African or otherwise. [...] That was the main reason many Party members, in my opinion, underestimated the need to unite with other Black organizations and to struggle around various community issues."<ref>Shakur, 1987, p. 221.</ref>

On April 6, 1971, Shakur was shot in the stomach during a struggle with a guest at the [[Hotel Pennsylvania|Statler Hilton Hotel]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]] and was arrested on a string of charges.

===Bronx bank robbery trials===
In her 1973 trial for a September 29, 1972 $3,700 robbery of the [[Manufacturer's Hanover Trust Company]] in the Bronx, Shakur and her co-defendant Kamau Sadiki (born Fred Hilton) represented themselves while their lawyers stayed mute, in protest of Judge Gagliardi allotting them what they perceived to be insufficient time for a proper defense.<ref name="p81">Perkins, 2000, p. 81.</ref><ref>''The New York Times''.

"Chesimard Acquitted". p. 104.</ref> The prosecution called four witnesses: Avon White and John Rivers (both of whom had been convicted of the robbery on September 29, 1972) and the manager and teller of the bank.<ref name="prial">Prial, Frank J. (December 12, 1973). "Prosecution Rests Case on Chesimard Robbery Trial; Defendant Ejected". ''The New York Times'', p. 54.</ref> White and Rivers, although convicted, had not yet been sentenced for the robbery and were promised that the charges would be dropped in exchange for their testimony.<ref name="prial"/> White and Rivers testified that Shakur had guarded one of the doors with a [[.357 magnum]] pistol and that Sadiki had served as a lookout and drove the getaway truck during the robbery; neither White nor Rivers was cross-examined due to the defense attorney's refusal to participate in the trial.<ref name="prial"/> Shakur's aunt and lawyer, Evelyn Williams, was also cited for contempt after walking out of the courtroom after many of her attempted motions were denied.<ref name="p81"/> The trial was delayed for a few days after Shakur was diagnosed with [[pleurisy]].<ref>''The New York Times''.

During the trial, the defendants were escorted to a "holding pen" outside the courtroom several times after shouting complaints and epithets at Judge Gagliardi.<ref name= "NYT_1973-12-06">Lichtenstein, Grace. 1973-12-06.

===Attempted murder dismissal===
Shakur and four others (including Fred Hilton, Avon White, and Andrew Jackson) were indicted in the State Supreme Court in Bronx on December 31, 1973 on charges of attempting to shoot and kill two policemen—Michael O'Reilly and Roy Polliana, who were wounded but had since returned to duty—in a January 28, 1973 ambush in [[St. Albans, Queens]].<ref>''The New York Times''.

Shakur was indicted on May 30, 1974 on the charge of having robbed a Brooklyn bar and kidnapping bartender James E.

===Queens bank robbery trial===
In July 1973, after being indicted by a grand jury, Shakur pleaded not guilty in Federal Court in Brooklyn to an indictment related to an August 31, 1971 $7,700 robbery of the [[Bankers Trust|Bankers Trust Company]] bank in Queens.<ref name="qbank">''The New York Times''.

One bank employee testified that Shakur was one of the bank robbers, but three other bank employees (including two tellers) testified that they were uncertain.<ref name="qacquit"/> The prosecution showed surveillance photos of four of the six alleged robbers, contending that one of them was Shakur wearing a wig.

===Turnpike trial===
[[Image:Map of New Jersey highlighting Middlesex County.svg|thumb|right|150px|Shakur's murder trial for the Turnpike shootout took place in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]],  [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]].]]
For Shakur's trial related to the New Jersey Turnpike shootout, Superior Court Judge Leon Gerofsky ordered a [[change of venue]] in 1973 from [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex]] to [[Morris County, New Jersey]], saying "it was almost impossible to obtain a jury here comprised of people willing to accept the responsibility of impartiality so that defendants will be protected from transitory passion and prejudice".<ref name="Hershberger">Hershberger, James.

(December 18, 2003). "News in brief from around New Jersey".</ref>

The nine-week trial was widely publicized, and was even reported on by the [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union]] (TASS).<ref name="b159"/><ref name="kirsta"/>  On March 25, 1977— back in Middlesex County— Shakur was convicted as an [[accomplice]] in the [[Felony murder|murders]] of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster and Zayd Shakur and possession of weapons, as well as of [[assault]] and [[attempted murder]] of Harper.<ref name= "NYT_1977-03-26"/> During the trial, hundreds of civil rights campaigners demonstrated outside of the Middlesex County courthouse each day.<ref name="kirsta"/>

Following the 13-minute opening statement by Edward J. Barone, the first assistant Middlesex County prosecutor (directing the case for the state), William Kunstler (the chief of Shakur's defense staff) moved immediately for a mistrial, calling the eight-count grand jury indictment "adversary proceeding solely and exclusively under the control of the prosecutor", whom Kunstler accused of "improper prejudicial remarks"; Judge Appleby, noting the frequent defense interruptions which had characterized the previous days' jury selection, denied the motion.<ref name="wag"/> The prosecution contended that Shakur shot and killed her companion, Zayd Shakur, and "executed" Trooper Foerster with his own weapon.<ref name="wag"/>

The next day the jury listened to State Police radio tapes while being provided with a printed transcript, an arrangement which was the result of "hours of haggling" between the defense and prosecution.<ref name="wag2"/> The "climax" of the tape came when Trooper Ronald Foster, the State Police radio operator, shouted into his microphone "They just shot Harper! Be on the lookout for this car!" and "It is a Pontiac. It's got one tail light" after the wounded Harper entered into the administration building near the site of the shootout.<ref name="wag2"/> As the tapes were played, Shakur was seated "calmly and without apparent concern" wearing a yellow [[turban]] and brightly colored floor-length dress over a white turtleneck sweater.<ref name="wag2"/>

Shakur's attorneys had successfully asked a 10-judge panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] to order that sessions for her murder trial not be held on Fridays because of [[Black Muslims|Black Muslim Sabbath]], although the Appeals Court for the Third Circuit rejected her plea to move the murder trial to a federal court.<ref>Janson, Donald.

On February 23, Shakur's attorneys filed papers asking Judge Appleby to [[subpoena]] FBI Director [[Clarence M. Kelley|Clarence Kelley]], Senator [[Frank Church]] and other federal and New York law enforcement officials to testify about the Counter Intelligence Program, which they alleged was designed to harass and disrupt black activist organizations.<ref name="sul">Sullivan, Joseph F.

Shakur herself was called as a witness on March 15, the first witness called by the defense; she denied shooting either Harper or Foerster, and also denied handling a weapon during the incident. She was questioned by her own attorney, Stuart Ball, for under 40&nbsp;minutes, and then cross-examined by Barone for less than two hours (see the [[Assata Shakur#Witnesses|Witnesses section]] below).<ref name="sul2"/> Ball's questioning ended with the following exchange:
:"On that night of May 2[n]d, did you shoot, kill, execute or have anything to do with the death of Trooper Werner Foerster?"
:"No."
:"Did you shoot or assault Trooper James Harper?"
:"No."<ref name="sul2">Sullivan, Joseph F. (March 16, 1977). "[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F0071EFE385D167493C4A81788D85F438785F9 Mrs. Chesimard, on Stand, Denies Having Weapon in Turnpike Shooting]". ''The New York Times'', p. 57.</ref>
Under cross-examination, Shakur was unable to explain how three clips of ammunition and 16 live shells had gotten into her shoulder bag; she also admitted to knowing that Zayd Shakur carried a gun at times, and specifically to seeing a gun sticking out of Acoli's pocket while stopping for supper at a [[Howard Johnson's]] restaurant shortly before the shooting.<ref name="sul2"/> Shakur admitted to carrying an identification card with the name "Justine Henderson" in her billfold the night of the shootout, but denied using any of the aliases on the long list that Barone proceeded to read.<ref name="sul2"/>

====Defense attorneys====
[[Image:William Kunstler.jpg|thumb|right|Self-described "radical lawyer" [[William Kunstler]] was the chief of Shakur's defense staff.]]
Shakur's defense attorneys were [[William Kunstler]] (the chief of Shakur's defense staff),<ref name="wag"/> Stuart Ball, Robert Bloom, Raymond Brown, Stanley Cohen (who died of unknown causes early on in the Turnpike trial), Lennox Hinds, [[Florynce Kennedy]], Louis Myers, Laurence Stern, and Evelyn Williams, Shakur's aunt.<ref name="nelson"/><ref>Shakur, 1987, p. 247.</ref><ref name="wag"/> Only Kunstler, Myers, Ball, Stern, and Cohen appeared in court, however, for the turnpike trial.<ref name= "NYT_1977-03-26"/> Kunstler became involved in Shakur's trials in 1975, when contacted by Williams, and commuted from New York City to New Brunswick every day with Stern.<ref>Kunstler, 1994, pp. 275–276.</ref>

Her attorneys, in particular Lennox Hinds, were often held in [[contempt of court]], which the [[National Conference of Black Lawyers]] cited as an example of systemic bias in the judicial system.<ref>''The New York Times''.

"Black Legal Group Assails U.S. Courts; Lawyers at Conference Find Bias Still Exists Against Blacks Despite Constitutional Bans". p. 67, column 6.</ref> The New Jersey Legal Ethics Committee also investigated complaints against Hinds for comparing Shakur's murder trial to "legalized lynching"<ref>''The New York Times''.

Judge Appleby also threatened Kunstler with dismissal and contempt of court after he delivered an October 21, 1976 speech at nearby [[Rutgers University]] that in part discussed the upcoming trial,<ref>Waldron, Martin. (December 3, 1976). "Kunstler and the Courts in a Battle On Right to Discuss Pending Trial".

====Medical evidence====
A key element of Shakur's defense was [[forensic biology|medical testimony]] meant to demonstrate that she was shot with her hands up and that she would have been subsequently unable to fire a weapon. A [[neurologist]] testified that the [[median nerve]] in Shakur's right arm was severed by the second bullet, making her unable to pull a trigger.<ref name="hinds"/> Neurosurgeon Dr. Arthur Turner Davidson, Associate Professor of Surgery at [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]], testified that the wounds in her upper arms, armpit and chest, and severed median nerve that instantly paralyzed her right arm, would only have been caused if both arms were raised, and that to sustain such injuries while crouching and firing a weapon (as described in Trooper Harper's testimony) "would be anatomically impossible".<ref name="kirsta"/><ref name="wag4">Waggoner, Walter H. (March 17, 1977). "Neurosurgeon's Testimony Backs Mrs. Chesimard". ''The New York Times'', Section 2, p. 20, column 3.</ref>

Davidson based his testimony on an August 4, 1976 examination of Shakur and on [[X-ray]]s taken immediately after the shootout at Middlesex General Hospital.<ref name="wag4"/> Prosecutor Barone questioned whether Davidson was qualified to make such a judgment 39&nbsp;months after the injury; Barone proceeded to suggest (while a female Sheriff's attendant acted out his suggestion) that Shakur was struck in the right arm and collar bone and "then spun around by the impact of the bullet so an immediate second shot entered the fleshy part of her upper left arm" to which Davidson replied "Impossible."<ref name="wag4"/>
[[Image:Illu pectoral girdles.png|thumb|right|Shakur's broken [[clavicle]] was a key element of her defense, and the implications of her injury for the differing accounts of the shootout were points of contention.]]
Dr. David Spain, a [[pathologist]] from [[Brookdale Community College]], testified that her bullet scars as well as X-rays supported her claim that her arms were raised, and that there was "no conceivable way" the first bullet could have hit Shakur's [[clavicle]] if her arm was down.<ref>Sullivan, Joseph F. (March 18, 1977). "[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F1091EFC385D167493CAA81788D85F438785F9 Doctor Testifies On Bullet Scars in Chesimard Trial]".

Judge Appleby eventually cut off funds for any further expert defense testimony.<ref name="kirsta"/> Shakur, in her autobiography, and Williams, in ''Inadmissible Evidence'', both claim that it was difficult to find expert witnesses for the trial, not only because of the financial expense, but also because most forensic and ballistic specialists declined on the grounds of a [[conflict of interest]] when approached because they routinely performed such work for law enforcement officials.<ref>Perkins, 2000, pp. 80–81.</ref>

====Other evidence====
[[Neutron activation analysis]] administered after the shootout showed no [[gun powder]] residue on Shakur's fingers; her [[fingerprint]]s were not found on any weapon at the scene, according to forensic analysis performed at the [[Trenton, New Jersey]] crime lab and the FBI crime labs in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name="howell">Howell, Ron. (June 7, 1998). "Revolutionary on Ice: Assata Shakur's Cuban Exile". ''Newsday''.</ref> According to tape recordings and police reports made several hours after the shoot-out, when Harper returned on foot to the administration building 200&nbsp;yards (183&nbsp;m) away, he did not report Foerster's presence at the scene; no one at headquarters knew of Foerster's involvement in the shoot-out until his body was discovered beside his patrol car, more than an hour later.<ref name="kirsta"/>

====Conviction and sentencing====
On March 24, the jurors listened for 45&nbsp;minutes to a rereading of testimony of the State Police chemist regarding the blood found at the scene, on the LeMans, and Shakur's clothing.<ref name="sul3"/> That night, the second night of jury deliberation, the jury asked Judge Appleby to repeat his instructions regarding the four assault charges 30&nbsp;minutes before retiring for the night, which lead to speculation that the jury had decided in Shakur's favor on the remaining charges, especially the two counts of murder.<ref name="sul3">Sullivan, Joseph E. (March 25, 1977). "[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10C11FB385D167493C7AB1788D85F438785F9 Chesimard Jury Asks Clarification of Assault Charges]". ''The New York Times'', p. 50. </ref> Appleby reiterated that the jury must consider separately the four assault charges (atrocious assault and battery, assault on a police officer acting in the line of duty, [[assault with a deadly weapon]], and assault with intent to kill), each of which carried a total maximum penalty of 33&nbsp;years in prison.<ref name="sul3"/> The other charges were: first-degree murder (of Foerster), second-degree murder (of Zayd Shakur), illegal possession of a weapon, and armed robbery (related to Foerster's service revolver).<ref name= "NYT_1977-03-26"/> The jury also asked Appleby to repeat the definitions of "[[intent]]" and "[[reasonable doubt]]".<ref name="sul3"/>

Shakur was convicted on all eight counts: two murder charges, and six assault charges.<ref name= "NYT_1977-03-26"/> The prosecution did not need to prove that Shakur fired the shots that killed either Trooper Foerster or Zayd Shakur: being an accomplice to murder carries an equivalent life sentence under New Jersey law.<ref name="kirsta">Kirsta, Alix. (May 29, 1999). "A black and white case - Investigation - Joanne Chesimard". ''The Times''.</ref> Upon hearing the verdict, Shakur said—in a "barely audible voice"—that she was "ashamed that I have even taken part in this trial" and that the jury was "racist" and had "convicted a woman with her hands up".<ref name= "NYT_1977-03-26"/> Judge Appleby told the court attendants to "remove the prisoner" and Shakur replied: "the prisoner will walk away on her own feet".<ref name= "NYT_1977-03-26"/> After Joseph W. Lewis, the jury foreman, read the verdict, Kunstler asked that the jury be removed before alleging that one juror had violated the sequestration order (see below).<ref name= "NYT_1977-03-26"/>

At Shakur's sentencing hearing on April 25, Appleby sentenced her to 26 to 33&nbsp;years in state prison (10 to 12 for the four counts of assault, 12 to 15 for robbery, 2 to 3 for armed robbery, plus 2 to 3 for aiding and abetting the murder of Foerster) which was to be served consecutively with her [[Mandatory sentencing|mandatory life sentence]]; however, Appleby dismissed the second-degree murder of Zayd Shakur, as the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] had recently narrowed the application of the law.<ref name="sentencing">Sullivan, Joseph F. (April 26, 1977). "[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00A1FFD3B5B167493C4AB178FD85F438785F9 Assault Charges Add 26 Years To Mrs. Chesimard's Life Term]". ''The New York Times'', p. 83, column 4. Retrieved on 2008-06-16.</ref> Appleby finally sentenced Shakur to 30&nbsp;days in the Middlesex County Workhouse for [[contempt of court]], concurrent with the other sentences, for refusing to rise when he entered the courtroom.<ref name="sentencing"/> To become eligible for [[parole]], Shakur would have had to serve a minimum of 25&nbsp;years, which would have included her four years in custody during the trials.<ref name="sentencing"/>

===Murder dismissal===
In October 1977, New York State Superior Court Justice John Starkey dismissed murder and robbery charges against Shakur related to the death of Richard Nelson during a December 28, 1972 hold-up of a Brooklyn social club, ruling that the state had [[Statute of limitations|delayed too long]] in bringing her to trial, saying "People have constitutional rights, and you can't shuffle them around."<ref name="seigel">Seigel, Max H.

''The New York Times'', p. 25, column 5.</ref> The case was delayed in being brought to trial as a result of an agreement between the Governors of New York and New Jersey as to the priority of the various charges against Shakur.<ref name="seigel"/> Three other defendants were indicted in relation to the same holdup: Melvin Kearney, who died in 1976 from an eight-floor fall while trying to escape from the Brooklyn House of Detention, Twymon Myers, who was killed by police while a fugitive, and Andrew Jackson, the charges against whom were dismissed when two prosecution witnesses could not identify him in a lineup.<ref name="seigel"/>

===Attempted robbery dismissal===
On November 22, 1977, Shakur pleaded not guilty to an attempted armed robbery indictment stemming from the 1971 incident at the [[Statler Hilton Hotel]].<ref name="tribrob">''Chicago Tribune''. (November 24, 1977). "Black lib army 'chief' denies 1971 robbery". p.

In September 1998, the [[United States Congress]] passed a non-binding resolution asking Cuba for the "return" of Shakur as well as 90 fugitives believed by Congress to be residing in Cuba;  House Concurrent Resolution 254 passed 371–0 in the House and by [[unanimous consent]] in the Senate.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d105:HC00254:@@@R House Concurrent Resolution 254].

In an open letter to Castro, [[chair (official)|chair]] of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] Representative [[Maxine Waters]] of California later explained that many members of the Caucus (including herself) were against Shakur's extradition but had mistakenly voted for the bill, which was placed on the accelerated suspension calendar, generally reserved for non-controversial legislation.<ref name="waters">Waters, Maxine.

On December 12, 2006 the Chancellor of the [[City University of New York]], [[Matthew Goldstein]], directed [[City College of New York|City College]]'s president, Gregory H. Williams, to remove the "unauthorized and inappropriate" designation of the "Guillermo Morales/Assata Shakur Community and Student Center", which was named by students in 1989, when a student group won the right to use the lounge after a campus shutdown over proposed tuition increases.<ref>Arenson, Karen W.

Shakur is still a notorious figure among New Jersey law enforcement officials. For example, black (now ex-)Trooper Anthony Reed sued the force, among other things, over posters of Shakur, altered to include Reed's badge number, being hung in Newark barracks, an incident that Reed considered "racist in nature".<ref>''The Star-Ledger''.
