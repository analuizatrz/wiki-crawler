'''Madness''' are an [[England|English]] [[Pop music|pop]]/[[ska]] band from [[Camden Town]], [[London]] that formed in 1976.<ref name="madness76"> {{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1976/text.htm  |title= The Madness Timeline: 1976 }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref> As of 2007, the band has continued to perform with their most recognised lineup of seven members, although their lineup has varied slightly over the years. They were one of the most prominent bands of the late-1970s [[2 Tone]] ska revival.<ref name="allmusic"> Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. {{cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:wifqxqe5ldfe~T1|title= "Allmusic.com 'Madness' biography" }} Retrieved on [[June 19]], [[2007]].</ref> However, as their career progressed, the band has moved away from ska and closer towards more conventional pop music.<ref name="allmusic"/>

Madness achieved most of their success in the 1980s.  Both Madness and [[UB40]] spent exactly 214 weeks on the UK singles charts from 1980-1989, thereby sharing the record for most weeks spent by a group in the 1980s UK singles charts.<ref>Rice 1990. p286</ref><ref>For Madness, the figure of 214 weeks does not include the 4 weeks on the charts by spin-off band "The Madness".  For UB40, the 214 weeks does not include the 8 weeks spent on the charts by "Reckless", credited to "Afrikaa Bambaataa and Family with UB40".</ref>


==Career==
===Formation===
The core of the band formed as '''The North London Invaders''' in [[1976]], and included [[Mike Barson]] (Monsieur Barso) on [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and [[vocals]], [[Chris Foreman]] (Chrissy Boy) on [[Electric guitar|guitar]] and [[Lee Jay Thompson|Lee Thompson]] (Kix) on [[saxophone]] and vocals.<ref name="madness76"/> They later recruited John Hasler on [[Drum kit|drums]] and Cathal Smyth (better known as [[Chas Smash]]) on [[bass guitar]]. Later in the year, they were joined by lead vocalist "Dikron".<ref name="madness76"/>

[[Image:Madness logo.gif|thumb|140px|left|The band's original logo.]]This six-piece lineup lasted until part way through [[1977]], when [[Graham McPherson]] (better known as Suggs) took over the lead vocals after seeing the band perform in a friend's [[Yard (land)|garden]].<ref name="madness77"> {{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1977/text.htm  |title= The Madness Timeline: 1977 }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref> [[Cathal Smyth|Smyth]], who was poor on [[bass guitar]], was replaced by Gavin Rogers, an acquaintance of Barson.<ref name="madness77"/> McPherson was kicked out of the band for too often choosing to watch [[Football (soccer)|football]] instead of rehearsing.<ref name="madness78"> {{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1978/text.htm  |title= The Madness Timeline: 1978 }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref> Thompson left the band after Barson criticised his [[saxophone]] playing.<ref name="madness78"/> 

By [[1978]], the band had allowed McPherson to return, after filling in temporarily for Hasler (who had taken over vocals when McPherson was removed).<ref name="madness78"/> Thompson returned after patching things up with Barson, and [[Daniel Woodgate]] (Woody) and Mark Bedford (Bedders) also joined the band, on drums and bass guitar respectively.<ref name="madness78"/> After briefly changing their name to '''Morris and the Minors''', the band renamed itself as Madness; paying homage to one of their favourite songs by [[ska]]/[[reggae]] artist [[Prince Buster]].<ref name="madness79"> {{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1979/text.htm  |title= The Madness Timeline: 1979 }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref> The band remained a sextet until late 1979, when Chas Smash rejoined and officially became the seventh member of Madness as a [[backing vocalist]] and [[trumpet]] player.<ref name="madness79"/>

In [[1979 in music|1979]], the band recorded the [[Lee Jay Thompson|Lee Thompson]] composition "[[The Prince (song)|The Prince]]".<ref name="madness79"/> The song, like the band's name, paid homage to their idol, [[Prince Buster]]. The song was released through [[2 Tone Records]], the label of [[The Specials]] founder [[Jerry Dammers]].<ref name="madness79"/> The song was a surprise hit, peaking in the UK music charts at #16.<ref name="madness79"/> A performance of "The Prince" on popular UK music show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' helped Madness gain public recognition. Madness then toured with fellow [[2 Tone]] bands The Specials and [[The Selecter]], before recording their debut album, ''[[One Step Beyond...]]'', which was released by [[Stiff Records]].<ref name="madness79"/> The album included a re-recording of "The Prince" and the band's second and third singles: "[[One Step Beyond (song)|One Step Beyond]]" and "[[My Girl (Madness song)|My Girl]]". The title song was a cover of the [[B-side]] of the 1960s Prince Buster hit "Al Capone". ''One Step Beyond...'' stayed in the [[Great Britain|British]] charts for over a year, peaking at #2.<ref name="madness79"/> The song "[[Night Boat to Cairo]]" was included on the ''[[Work Rest and Play EP]]'', which reached #6 in the UK singles chart.<ref name="madness79"/>
 
The following year, the band's second album, ''[[Absolutely (album)|Absolutely]]'' reached #2 in the UK album charts.<ref name="madness80"> {{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1980/text.htm  |title= The Madness Timeline: 1980 }} Retrieved on [[June 19]], [[2007]].</ref> ''Absolutely'' spawned some of the band's biggest hits, most notably "[[Baggy Trousers]]"; which peaked at #3 in the UK singles chart.<ref name="madness80"/> "[[Embarrassment (song)|Embarrassment]]" reached #4 in the charts, and the instrumental song "[[Return of the Los Palmas 7]]" climbed to #7.<ref name="madness80"/>

===Change of direction===
{{sound sample box align left| }}
{{multi-listen start|Audio sample of:}}
{{multi-listen item|filename=Madness - Our House.ogg|title="Our House" (1982) |description=The band's most internationally successful single. The song inspired a musical of the same name in 2003, which featured songs from Madness. |format=[[Ogg]]}}
{{multi-listen end}}
{{sample box end}}In 1981, the band's third studio album, ''[[7 (Madness album)|7]]'' reached #5 in the UK album charts and contained three hit singles.<ref name="madness81"> {{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1981/text.htm  |title= The Madness Timeline: 1981 }} Retrieved on [[June 19]], [[2007]].</ref> Unlike the two [[ska]]-filled, fast-paced albums that preceded it, ''7'' was somewhat of a change in direction. [[Graham McPherson|Suggs']] vocal performance changed significantly, and his strong [[Cockney]] accent from the previous albums had been watered down. The album strayed from the ska-influenced sound of ''[[One Step Beyond...]]'' and ''[[Absolutely (album)|Absolutely]]'', and moved towards a more conventional and mature [[Pop music|pop]] sound; a trend that continued with subsequent albums. Near the end of [[1981 in music|1981]], Madness released one of their most recognised songs; a remake of [[Labi Siffre]]'s 1971 hit "[[It Must Be Love]]".<ref name="madness81"/> The song climbed to #4 in the UK and entered the [[United States|US]]  charts at #33.<ref name="madness81"/><ref name="2tone1"> {{cite web|url= http://2-tone.info/artists/madness.html  |title= 2 Tone Records - Artists }} Retrieved on [[June 19]], [[2007]].</ref> In 1982, Madness released their only #1 hit to date, "[[House of Fun]]"; as well as their fourth studio album ''[[The Rise & Fall]]''.<ref name="madness82"> {{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1982/text.htm  |title= The Madness Timeline: 1982 }} Retrieved on [[June 19]], [[2007]].</ref> The album contained their most internationally successful single to date, "[[Our House (Madness song)|Our House]]", which reached #5 in the UK music charts and # 7 in the US charts.<ref name="madness82"/><ref name="storychap5"> Clayden, Andy. [http://www.hilltop61.freeserve.co.uk/2tone/madness5.html  "The Madness Story: Chapter 5"] Retrieved [[June 19]], [[2007]]</ref> In 1983, their single "[[Wings of a Dove]]" peaked at #2 in the UK charts.<ref name="madness83"> {{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1983/text.htm  |title= The Madness Timeline: 1983  }} Retrieved on [[June 19]], [[2007]].</ref> Their following album, ''[[Keep Moving]]'', peaked at #6 in the UK album charts, and several singles from that album reached the top 20 in the UK music charts.<ref name="madness84"> {{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1984/text.htm  |title= The Madness Timeline: 1984 }} Retrieved on [[June 19]], [[2007]].</ref>

===Decline and breakup===
[[Image:Keep moving.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The ''Keep Moving'' album was Mike Barson's last contribution to the band, until their subsequent reunion.]]In October [[1983 in music|1983]], the band's founder, keyboardist and prominent songwriter [[Mike Barson]] decided to leave the band, partly because he had relocated to [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]].<ref name="madness83"> {{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1983/text.htm  |title= The Madness Timeline: 1983 }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref>  He officially left the band in June 1984, following the release of "One Better Day".<ref name="madness84"> {{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1984/text.htm  |title= The Madness Timeline: 1984 }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref> The six remaining members left [[Stiff Records]] and formed their own label, [[Zarjazz Records]], which was sub-label of [[Virgin Records]].<ref name="madness84"/> In 1985, the label released the band's sixth album, ''[[Mad Not Mad]]''. Barson's keyboard parts were filled by [[synthesiser]]s, and in later years, frontman [[Graham McPherson|Suggs]] described the production as "polished turd".<ref name="storychap6"> Clayden, Andy. [http://www.hilltop61.freeserve.co.uk/2tone/madness6.html  "The Madness Story: Chapter 6"] Retrieved [[June 6]], [[2007]]</ref> The album reached #16 in the UK charts, which was the band's lowest position on the album charts to date. Despite the poor chart showing, the album was listed as #55 in [[NME]]'s ''All Time 100 Albums''.<ref name="nmelist"> {{cite web|url= http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/nme_writers.htm#albums  |title= NME Writers All Time Albums}} Retrieved on [[June 2]], [[2007]].</ref> The singles for the album fared even worse, with "Yesterday's Men" peaking at #18 in the UK charts. The subsequent singles, "Uncle Sam" and "Sweetest Girl", failed to make the top 20, which was a first for Madness singles.

The band then attempted to record a new album, and 11 demo tracks were recorded.<ref name="storychap6"/> However, musical differences arose between band members, and in September 1986, the band announced that they were to split.<ref name="storychap6"/><ref name="madness86"> {{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1986/text.htm  |title= The Madness Timeline: 1986 }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref> Barson rejoined the band for a farewell single, "[[(Waiting For) The Ghost Train]]", but did not appear in the [[music video]].<ref name="madness86"/> The band officially split following the release of the single, which reached a high of #18 in the UK. In [[1988 in music|1988]], four members of the band — Suggs, [[Chas Smash]], [[Lee Jay Thompson|Lee Thompson]] and [[Chris Foreman]] — created a new band, using the name '''The Madness'''.<ref name="themadness"> Cater, Darryl. {{cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:kifyxqwhldae  |title= "Allmusic.com 'The Madness' biography" }} Retrieved on [[June 20]], [[2007]].</ref>  After one [[The Madness (album)|self-titled]] album and two singles that failed to make the the top 40, the band split.

===Reunions and The Dangermen===
In early [[1992 in music|1992]], "[[It Must Be Love]]" was re-released and reached #6 in the UK singles chart. Following that, the singles compilation ''[[Divine Madness (Madness album)|Divine Madness]]'' was released and peaked at #1 in the album charts. Madness then announced plans for a reunion concert, [[Madstock!]], which was held at [[Finsbury Park]], [[London]] on August 8 and 9 of that year.<ref name="totp"> {{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/totp2/features/top5/madness.shtml  |title=  BBC Top of the Pops 2 Top 5  }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref> The original lineup reunited, performing together for the first time since [[Mike Barson]] left the band in [[1984 in music|1984]]. Over 75,000 fans attended the weekend festival, and during "[[One Step Beyond (song)|One Step Beyond]]", the crowd danced so much they caused a an [[Earthquake|earth tremor]] which measured over 4 on the [[richter scale]].<ref name="quake"> Radford, Tim. {{cite web|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,816938,00.html  |title= "Guardian article mentioning Finsbury Park tremor" }} Retrieved on [[June 3]], [[2007]].</ref><ref name="suggsimdb"> {{cite web|url= http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0574227/bio |title= IMDB profile for Graham McPherson }} Retrieved on [[June 10]], [[2007]].</ref> A subsequent [[live album]] was released, and the associated single, "[[The Harder They Come]]" (a cover of [[Jimmy Cliff]]'s [[1973 in music|1973]] song) reached #44 in the UK.

{{multi-listen item|filename=Madness - Lovestruck.ogg|title="Lovestruck" (1999) |description=Released in 1999, this was the band's first original single in 13 years. It was a hit for the band, entering the top ten in the UK charts. |format=[[Ogg]]}}
{{multi-listen end}}
{{sample box end}}The band continued to reunite for annual UK [[Christmas]] season tours and held three more Madstock! festivals; in 1994, 1996 and 1998. In 1999, Madness released their first studio album since 1986, entitled ''[[Wonderful (Madness album)|Wonderful]]''. The album reached #17 in the UK album charts, and the lead single, "[[Lovestruck]]", gave the band their first new top 10 hit in the UK since 1983. Neither of the two subsequent singles from the album, "Johnny The Horse" and "Drip Fed Fred", entered the top 40 of the UK charts. 

From October 28, 2002 to August 16, 2003, a [[Musical theatre|musical]] based on Madness songs, ''[[Our House (musical)|Our House]]'', ran at the [[Cambridge Theatre]] in [[west London]]. Madness played a role in the executive production of the show, and Suggs played a role in the production for awhile; playing the central character's father.<ref name="ourhousebbc"> Shenton, Mark. {{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/entertainment/theatre/ourhouse_180303.shtml  |title= "Our House with Suggs, a first night review" }} Retrieved on [[June 20]], [[2007]].</ref> It won an [[Olivier Award]] for best new musical,<ref name="oliv"> {{cite web|url= http://www.officiallondontheatre.co.uk/awards/winners#Musical   |title= "Laurence Olivier Awards - Chronological list of winning musicals" }} Retrieved on [[June 6]], [[2007]].</ref> and the performance was released on [[DVD]] on [[November 1]], [[2004]].<ref name="oliv"> {{cite web|url= http://www.amazon.co.uk/Our-House-Musical-Story-Madness/dp/B0002W0Z5Q   |title= "Amazon.co.uk page for "Our House - A Musical Love Story" DVD}} Retrieved on [[June 20]], [[2007]].</ref>

In 2004, the band played a series of low-key concerts as '''The Dangermen''', performing covers of classic [[reggae]] and [[ska]] songs. A lot of the songs were those played by the band when they were first forming,<ref name="suggsbbc04">Long, Chris. {{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/music/2004/06/17/suggs_interview.shtml   |title= "Interview with Suggs of Madness (June 2004)" }} Retrieved on [[June 20]], [[2007]].</ref> and the band performed the songs as a celebration of their 25 year anniversary.<ref name="suggsbbc04"/> This led to the release of the album ''[[The Dangermen Sessions Vol. 1]]'' in August [[2005 in music|2005]]. The album peaked at #11 in the UK album charts, which was the band's highest studio album chart position in 21 years. Although two singles were released, neither was a major success in the UK. The more successful of the two, "[[Shame & Scandal]]", reached #38. In France, that single peaked at #12. Following the release of the album, [[Chris Foreman]] left the band.

[[Image:Modern Madness Logo.jpg|thumb|177px|left|The modern Madness logo replaces the traditional pork pie hat with a crown.]]In late 2006, Madness began working on their first original album in seven years. This was without Foreman, who had previously complained that the band had recorded only one album with new material since their reunion in 1992. In March 2007, the single "[[Sorry (Madness song)|Sorry]]" was released, peaking in the UK charts at #23. The single included a version featuring UK [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists [[Sway DaSafo]] and Baby Blue. The new Madness song "NW5 (I Would Give You Everything)" and a re-recorded version of "[[It Must Be Love]]" were featured in the [[Germany|German]] film ''Neues vom Wixxer''. The two songs were released in [[Germany]] as a [[double A-Side]], and both of them were turned into [[music videos]]. Foreman rejoined the band for their 2006 Christmas season tour, but he did not appear in the video for "Sorry", despite being a member of the band at the time. While promoting "Sorry", Sway DaSafo confirmed in an interview with ''[[NME]]'' that he will perform in the recording of Madness' updated version of their song "[[Baggy Trousers]]", entitled "Baggy Jeans".<ref name="baggyjeans"> {{cite web|url= http://www.nme.com/news/madness/27212?  |title=  Madness to re-record classic hit with Sway }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref>




==Lyrical themes==
Although Madness were seen by many as somewhat of a humorous band with catchy songs and enthusiastic dancing, they sometimes tackled, what were at the time, controversial issues in their lyrics. "[[Embarrassment (song)|Embarrassment]]" (from the "[[Absolutely (album)|Absolutely]]" album) was written by [[Lee Jay Thompson|Lee Thompson]], and reflected the unfolding turmoil following the news that his teenage sister had become [[pregnant]] and was carrying a [[Black people|black man's]] child.<ref name="embarrassment">Duffy, Jonathan. {{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4465666.stm  |title= "An embarrassment no more"  }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref> The band discussed [[animal testing]] in the song "Tomorrow's Dream".<ref name="animaltesting"> Thompson, Lee. {{cite web|url=http://www.madness.co.uk/seven/one_6c.htm  |title= "Tomorrow's Dream": What's it all about? }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref> The band criticized the [[National Health Service]] in "Mrs. Hutchinson"; which told the story of a woman who, after several misdiagnoses and mistreatment, became [[Terminal illness|terminally ill]]. The story was based on the experiences of [[Mike Barson|Mike Barson's]] mother.<ref name="mrsh">Barson, Mike. {{cite web|url=http://www.madness.co.uk/seven/one_5c.htm  |title= "Mrs. Hutchinson": What's it all about? }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref> Madness' final single prior to disbanding, "[[(Waiting For) The Ghost Train]]", commented on [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid]] in [[South Africa]].<ref name="madness86"/>

==Skinhead controversy==
Early in their career, Madness were linked to [[skinhead]]s; members of a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[working class]] [[subculture]] that the media often stereotyped as [[Racism|racist]] (although many skinheads are [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]]).<ref name="madness79"/><ref name="sharpskins"> {{cite web|url= http://www.skinheadnation.co.uk/sharpskinheads.htm  |title= "SHARP Skinheads" }} Retrieved on [[June 25]], [[2007]].</ref> Not only were Madness, along with other [[2 Tone]] bands, popular with skinheads, but it was said that the band members themselves were associated with the subculture.<ref name="madness79"/> In a 1979 ''[[NME]]'' interview, Madness member [[Chas Smash]] was quoted as saying "We don't care if people are in the [[British National Front|NF]] as long as they're having a good time."<ref name="madness79"/> This added to speculation that Madness was a racist band supporting the National Front, although the band members denied those allegations, and Chas Smash responded to the ''NME'' article in the song "Don't Quote Me On That".<ref name="madness79"/> The band members then denied that their roots were in the skinhead culture, which disappointed much of their skinhead fan base.<ref name="skinheads1"> Pateman, John. {{cite web|url= http://libr.org/isc/occasional_papers/gallery2.html  |title= "This Was England: a Skinhead exhibition from the 1980s" }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref>

==Awards==
