[[Image:Addition on cubic.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An image illustrating geometric addition on a [[cubic curve]] in [[projective space]]. [[Ring theory]] has many important applications in [[algebraic geometry]].]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''ring''' is an [[algebraic structure]] consisting of a [[set]] together with two [[binary operations]] (usually called [[addition]] and [[multiplication]]), where each operation combines two [[element]]s to form a third element. To qualify as a ring, the set together with its two operations must satisfy certain conditions; namely the set must be an [[Abelian group]] under addition, a [[monoid]] under multiplication,{{cref|a}} such that multiplication [[distributive law|distributes]] over addition. While these operations are familiar from many [[mathematical structure]]s, such as [[number system]]s or the [[integer]]s—for example, they are also very general in the sense that they take a broad variety of mathematical objects into account. This allows one to handle entities of very different mathematical origins in a flexible way, while retaining essential structural aspects of many objects in [[abstract algebra]] and beyond. The ubiquity of rings makes them a central organizing principle of contemporary [[mathematics]]. The branch of mathematics that studies rings is known as [[ring theory]].

==Definition and illustration==
===First example: the integers===

The most familiar example of a ring is the set of all [[integer]]s, '''Z''', consisting of the [[number]]s

:..., −4, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,&nbsp;... <ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = App. 2, p. 360|nb = yes}}</ref>

together with the usual operations of addition and multiplication.  These operations satisfy the following properties:

* The integers form an ''[[Abelian group]]'' under addition; that is:
** ''[[Closure (mathematics)|Closure axiom for addition]]'': Given two integers ''a'' and ''b'', their sum, ''a'' + ''b'' is also an integer.
** ''[[Associative|Associativity of addition]]'': For any integers, ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' = ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c''). So, adding ''b'' to ''a'', and then adding ''c'' to this result, is the same as adding ''c'' to ''b'', and then ''a'' to this result. 
** ''[[Identity element|Existence of additive identity]]'': For any integer ''a'', ''a'' + 0 = 0 + ''a'' = ''a''. [[Zero]] is called the identity element of the integers because adding 0 to any integer (in any order) returns the same integer.
** ''[[Inverse element|Existence of additive inverse]]'': For any integer ''a'', there exists an integer denoted by &minus;''a'' such that ''a'' + (&minus;''a'') = (&minus;''a'') + ''a'' = 0. The element, &minus;''a'', is called the ''additive inverse'' of ''a'' because adding ''a'' to &minus;''a'' (in any order) returns the identity.
** ''[[Commutative operation|Commutativity of addition]]'': For any two integers ''a'' and ''b'', ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''. So the order in which you add two integers is irrelevant. 

* The integers form a multiplicative [[monoid]] (a [[monoid]] under multiplication); that is:
** ''[[Closure (mathematics)|Closure axiom for multiplication]]'': Given two integers ''a'' and ''b'', their product, ''a'' ⋅ ''b'' is also an integer.
** ''[[Associative|Associativity of multiplication]]'': Given any integers, ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', (''a'' ⋅ ''b'') ⋅ ''c'' = ''a'' ⋅ (''b'' ⋅ ''c''). So multiplying ''b'' with ''a'', and then multiplying ''c'' to this result, is the same as multiplying ''c'' with ''b'', and then multiplying ''a'' to this result. 
** ''[[Identity element|Existence of multiplicative identity]]'': For any integer ''a'', ''a'' ⋅ 1 = 1 ⋅ ''a'' = ''a''. So multiplying any integer with 1 (in any order) gives back that integer. [[One]] is therefore called the multiplicative identity.
* ''[[Distributive|Multiplication is distributive over addition]]'' : These two structures on the integers (addition and multiplication) are compatible in the sense that 
** ''a'' ⋅ (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' ⋅ ''b'') + (''a'' ⋅ ''c''), and
** (''a'' + ''b'') ⋅ ''c'' = (''a'' ⋅ ''c'') + (''b'' ⋅ ''c'')
: for any three integers ''a'', ''b'' and ''c''.

An important difference between the additive and multiplicative properties enumerated above is that multiplicative inverses are not required to exist.  For instance, there is no integer ''a'' such that ''a''&nbsp;·&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.  This property distinguishes the integers from the [[rational number]]s, which is also a [[set]] endowed with operations of addition and multiplication, satisfying all of the above properties but also the existence of a [[multiplicative inverse]] for each nonzero element: namely if ''a'' and ''b'' are nonzero integers the inverse of the rational number ''a''/''b'' is simply ''b''/''a''.  Although in some naive sense the rational numbers are "more complicated" than the integers (e.g. in the sense that a rational number can be viewed as an ordered pair of integers, subject to certain [[equivalence relation|equivalences]]), in many respects the existence of multiplicative inverses gives the rational numbers a simpler structure.  For instance, given a pair of integers ''a'' and ''b'' we may consider the [[relation]] that ''b'' is exactly divisible by ''a'', i.e., there exists an integer ''c'' such that ''a''&nbsp;·&nbsp;''c''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''b'', and using this we get a rich theory of prime and composite numbers, factorization, and so forth.  In contrast any nonzero rational number divides any other nonzero rational number, a much less interesting relation.  This is prototypical of the different and richer structure that an arbitrary ring has in comparison to a [[field]] or a [[division ring]] ([[Ring_(mathematics)#Integral domains and fields|see below]]).

===Formal definition===

{{Algebraic structures}}

A '''ring''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''R'' equipped with two [[binary operation]]s <!--Do not change the &times; symbol to a plus sign: the binary operation of + is defined on the product of R with itself --> + : ''R'' &times; ''R'' → ''R'' and '''·''' : ''R'' &times; ''R'' → ''R'' (where &times; denotes the [[Cartesian product]]), called ''addition'' and ''multiplication''. To qualify as a ring, the set and two operations, (''R'', +, ⋅), must satisfy the following requirements known as the ''ring axioms''. <ref>{{Harvard citations|last = Herstein|year = 1975|loc = §2.1, p. 27|nb = yes}}</ref>

* (''R'', +, ·) is required to be an ''[[Abelian group]]'' under addition:

* (''R'', +, ·) is required to be a [[monoid]] under multiplication:

|} 

* The distributive laws:

:{|
| 1.  For all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''R'', the equation ''a'' · (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' · ''b'') + (''a'' · ''c'') holds.
|-
| 2. For all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''R'', the equation (''a'' + ''b'') · ''c'' = (''a'' · ''c'') + (''b'' · ''c'') holds.
|}

===Notes on the definition===

As with some [[axiomatic framework|axiomatic theories]], there are often disputes as to what axioms a ring should satisfy. Sometimes the disagreement between two definitions is minor. For instance, some authors insist that 1 ≠ 0 in a ring (in words, this means that the multiplicative identity of the ring must be different from its additive identity). In particular they don't consider the [[trivial ring]] to be a ring ([[Ring_(mathematics)#Third_example:_the_trivial_ring|see below]]). 

A more significant disagreement is that some authors omit the existence of a multiplicative identity in a ring<ref>[[Israel Nathan Herstein|Herstein, I. N.]] ''Topics in Algebra'', Wiley; 2 edition (June 20, 1975), ISBN 0-471-01090-1.</ref><ref>{{cite book

}}</ref>. For instance, this would allow the even integers to form a ring with the natural operations of addition and multiplication ([[Ring_(mathematics)#Formal_definition|all ring axioms]] are satisfied except for the existence of a [[multiplicative identity]]). Rings that satisfy the ring axioms [[Ring_(mathematics)#Formal_definition|as given above]] but do not contain a multiplicative identity are called [[pseudo-ring]]s. Rings which ''do have'' multiplicative identities (and also satisfy the above axioms) are sometimes referred to '''[[unital ring]]s''', '''unitary rings''', or simply '''rings with unity''' or '''rings with identity'''.<ref>{{cite book|title = Introduction to Foundations of Mathematics|author = Raymond Louis Wilder|publisher = John Wiley and Sons|year = 1965|page = 176|accessdate = 2008-12-21}}</ref> The term '''[[rng (algebra)|rng]]''' (jocular; ring without the multiplicative '''i'''dentity) is also used for such rings. Note that one can always [[embedding|embed]] a [[unitary ring|non-unitary ring]] inside a [[unitary ring]] in the [[canonical]] manner ([[Rng_(algebra)#Adjoining_an_identity_element|see this]] for a [[mathematical proof|proof]]). 

There are still other more significant differences between two particular definitions of a ring. For instance, some authors omit associativity of multiplication in the set of ring axioms; rings that are [[associative|nonassociative]] are called [[nonassociative ring]]s. In this article, all rings are assumed to satisfy the axioms [[Ring_(mathematics)#Formal_definition|as given above]].

===Commutative ring===

{{Main|Commutative ring}}

Although ring addition is [[commutative law|commutative]], so that for every ''a'', ''b'' in ''R'', ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a'', ring multiplication is not required to be commutative; ''a'' ⋅ ''b'' need not equal ''b'' ⋅ ''a'' for some ''a'', ''b'' in ''R''. Rings that also satisfy commutativity for multiplication are called '''[[commutative ring]]s'''.{{cref|e}} Formally,

'''Formal definition'''

Let (''R'', +, ⋅) be a ring. Then (''R'', +, ⋅) is said to be a '''commutative ring''' if for every ''a'', ''b'' in ''R'', ''a'' ⋅ ''b'' = ''b'' ⋅ ''a''. That is, (''R'', +, ⋅) is required to be a [[commutative monoid]] under multiplication.

'''Examples'''

* The integers form a commutative ring under the natural operations of addition and multiplication.

* An example of a non-commutative ring is the ring of ''n'' &times; ''n'' [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'', for ''n''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;1. In particular, the ring of all 2 &times; 2 matrices over '''R''' do not form a commutative ring as the following calculation shows:

:<math>\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1\\
0 & 1\\
\end{bmatrix}\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1\\
1 & 0\\
\end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 1\\
1 & 0\\
\end{bmatrix}
</math>, which is not equal to <math>\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1\\
1 & 0\\
\end{bmatrix}\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1\\
0 & 1\\
\end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2\\
1 & 1\\
\end{bmatrix}.
</math>

===Second example: the ring '''Z'''<sub>4</sub>===

Consider the set '''Z'''<sub>4</sub> consisting of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3 where addition and multiplication are defined as follows (note that for any integer, ''x'', ''x'' mod 4 is defined to be the reminder when ''x'' is divided by 4):

* For any ''x'', ''y'' in '''Z'''<sub>4</sub>, ''x'' + ''y'' is defined to be their sum in '''Z''' (the set of ''all integers'') [[Modular arithmetic|mod 4]]. So we can represent the additive structure of '''Z'''<sub>4</sub> by the left-most table as shown.

* For any ''x'', ''y'' in '''Z'''<sub>4</sub>, ''x'' ⋅ ''y'' is defined to be their product in '''Z''' (the set of ''all integers'') [[modular arithmetic|mod 4]]. So we can represent the multilplicative structure of '''Z'''<sub>4</sub> by the right-most table as shown.

It is simple (but tedious) to verify that '''Z'''<sub>4</sub> is a ring under these operations. First of all, one can use the left-most table to show that '''Z'''<sub>4</sub> is closed under addition (any result is either 0, 1, 2 or 3). Associativity of addition in '''Z'''<sub>4</sub> follows from associativity of addition in the set of ''all integers''. The additive identity is 0 as can be verified by looking at the left-most table. Given an integer ''x'', there is always an inverse of ''x''; this inverse is given by 4 - ''x'' as one can verify from the additive table. Therefore, '''Z'''<sub>4</sub> is an [[Abelian group]] under addition.

Similarly, '''Z'''<sub>4</sub> is closed under multiplication as the right-most table shows (any result above is either 0, 1, 2 or 3). Associativity of multiplication in '''Z'''<sub>4</sub> follows from associativity of multiplication in the set of ''all integers''. The multiplicative identity is 1 as can be verified by looking at the right-most table. Therefore, '''Z'''<sub>4</sub> is a [[monoid]] under multiplication.

Distributivity of the two operations over each other follow from distributivity of addition over multiplication (and [[vice-versa]]) in '''Z''' (the set of ''all integers''). 

Therefore, this set does indeed form a ring under the given operations of addition and multiplication.

'''Properties of this ring'''

* In general, given any two integers, ''x'' and ''y'', if ''x'' ⋅ ''y'' = 0, then either ''x'' is 0 or ''y'' is 0. Somewhat surprising is that this does not hold for the ring ('''Z'''<sub>4</sub>, +, ⋅):

:: 2 ⋅ 2 = 0  

:although neither [[factor]] is 0. In general, a ''non-zero element'' ''a'' of a ring, (''R'', +, ⋅) is said to be a '''[[zero divisor]]''' in (''R'', +, ⋅), if there exists a non-zero element ''b'' of ''R'' such that ''a'' ⋅ ''b'' = 0. So in this ring, the only zero divisor is 2 (note that 0 ⋅ ''a'' = 0 for ''any'' ''a'' in a ring (''R'', +, ⋅) so 0 is ''not'' considered to be a zero divisor).

* A commutative ring which has no zero divisors is called an '''[[integral domain]]''' ([[Ring_(mathematics)#Integral_domains_and_fields|see below]]). So '''Z''', the ring of all integers ([[Ring_(mathematics)#First_example:_the_integers|see above]]), is an integral domain (and therefore a ring), although '''Z'''<sub>4</sub> (the above example) ''does not'' form an integral domain (but is still a ring). So in general, every integral domain is a ring but not every ring is an integral domain.

===Third example: the trivial ring===

If we define on the [[singleton set]] {0}:

0 + 0 = 0

0 ⋅ 0 = 0

then one can verify that ({0}, +, ⋅) forms a ring known as the '''[[trivial ring]]'''. Since there can be only one result for any product or sum (0), this ring is both closed and associative for addition and multiplication, and furthermore satisfies the distributive law. The additive and multiplicative identities are both equal to 0. Similarly, the additive inverse of 0, is 0.  The trivial ring is also a (rather trivial) example of a '''[[zero ring]]''' (see below).

==History==

{{Main|Ring_theory#History}}

[[File:Dedekind.jpeg|thumb|100px|right|A portrait of [[Richard Dedekind]]: the founder of [[ring theory]].]]

The study of rings originated from the theory of [[polynomial ring]]s and the theory of [[algebraic integer]]s.  Furthermore, the appearance of [[hypercomplex number]]s in the mid-nineteenth century undercut the pre-eminence of [[field (mathematics)|fields]] in mathematical analysis. 

[[Richard Dedekind]] (image to the right) introduced the concept of a ring. [http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Ring_theory.html]

The term ''ring (Zahlring)'' was coined by [[David Hilbert]] in the article ''Die Theorie der algebraischen Zahlkörper,'' Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker Vereinigung, Vol. 4, 1897. [http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Ring_theory.html]

The first axiomatic definition of a ring was given by [[Adolf Fraenkel]] in an essay in ''[[Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik]]'' (A. L. Crelle), vol. 145, 1914. [http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Ring_theory.html]

In 1921, [[Emmy Noether]] gave the first axiomatic foundation of the theory of [[commutative ring]]s in her monumental paper ''Ideal Theory in Rings''. [http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Ring_theory.html]

==Simple consequences of the ring axioms==

{{Main|Elementary group theory}}

Basic facts about rings that can be deduced from the ring axioms are commonly subsumed under ''elementary ring theory''. For example, one can deduce uniqueness of the additive identity in a ring, and uniqueness of the additive inverse of a particular element in a ring using group theory alone. Similarly, the inverse of a [[Unit (ring theory)|unit in a ring]] is necessarily unique (provable using group theory). However, some properties that effectively combine the additive and multiplicative structures in a ring cannot be proved by group theoretical means alone. For example, one cannot prove that for every element ''a'' in a ring (''R'', +, ⋅), ''a'' ⋅ 0 = 0 ⋅ ''a'' = 0, using ''only one'' of the structures. One also must take advantage of distributivity of multiplication over addition (see below). This constitutes one explanation as to why ring theory is important in its own right. This also explains why distributivity is such an important axiom in ring theory.

===Basic properties of rings=== 

From the axioms, one can deduce that if (''R'', +, ⋅)  is a ring, for all ''a'', ''b'' in ''R'' we have:

'''Theorem 1''': 0 ⋅ ''a'' = ''a'' ⋅ 0 = 0

{{hidden
|(Click "show" at right to see the proof of this theorem or "hide" to hide it.)
|2= 

0 ⋅ ''a'' = (0 + 0) ⋅ ''a'' = (0 ⋅ ''a'') + (0 ⋅ ''a'')

, by subtracting 0 ⋅ ''a'' on both sides of the equation, we get the desired result. The proof that ''a'' ⋅ 0 = 0 is similar.}}

'''Corollary 1''': A ring, (''R'', +, ⋅) is trivial (that is, consists of precisely one element) if and only if 0 = 1.

{{hidden
|(Click "show" at right to see the proof of this theorem or "hide" to hide it.)
|2=

Suppose 1 = 0. Let ''a'' be in ''R''; then ''a'' ⋅ 1 = 1 ⋅ ''a'' = ''a''. Since 1 = 0, ''a'' ⋅ 0 = 0 ⋅ ''a'' = ''a''. But ''a'' ⋅ 0 = 0 ⋅ ''a'' = 0. Therefore, ''a'' = 0. Since ''a'' was arbitrary, ''R'' consists of only one element, namely 0. Therefore, (''R'', +, ⋅) is the trivial ring. Conversly, if (''R'', +, ⋅) is trivial, it must contain precisely one element. Therefore, 0 = 1 (otherwise ''R'' would consist of at least two elements).}}

'''Theorem 2''': (&minus;1)''a'' = &minus;''a''

{{hidden
|(Click "show" at right to see the proof of this theorem or "hide" to hide it.)
|2=

(&minus;1)''a'' + ''a'' = (&minus;1)''a'' + (1)''a'' = (-1 + 1)''a'' = (0)''a'' = 0

. Similarly, ''a'' + (&minus;1)''a'' = 0, so that (&minus;1)''a'' is the additive inverse of ''a''. Since the additive inverse of ''a'' is necessarily unique, (&minus;1)''a'' = &minus;''a'', as desired.}}

'''Theorem 3''': (&minus;''a'') ⋅ ''b'' = ''a'' ⋅ (&minus;''b'') = &minus;(''ab'')

{{hidden
|(Click "show" at right to see the proof of this theorem or "hide" to hide it.)
|2=

(&minus;''a'') ⋅ ''b'' = (-1) ⋅ (''a'' ⋅ ''b'') = ''a''⋅ (-1) ⋅ ''b'' = ''a''(&minus;''b'') 

Similarly,

''a''(&minus;''b'') = ''a'' ⋅ (-1) ⋅ ''b'' = (-1) ⋅ ''a'' ⋅ ''b'' = &minus;(''ab'')

as desired.}}

===Group properties of rings===

{{Main|Elementary group theory}}

* An ''integer in a ring'' is an element ''n'' of the ring that can be written either as:

:: ''n'' = 1 + ... + 1 or,

:: ''n'' = &minus;1 &minus; ... &minus; 1

:Note that for any element ''a'' of a ring (''R'',&nbsp;+,&nbsp;⋅), ''a''&nbsp;⋅&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;⋅&nbsp;''a'' for any integer ''n''. In words, this means that the order in which you multiply an integer with another element in a ring is irrelevant.

* If a ring is a [[cyclic group]] under addition, then it is [[commutative ring|commutative]] ([[Ring_(mathematics)#Commutative ring|see above]]).

===Binomial theorem for rings===

{{Main|Binomial theorem}}

* The '''[[binomial theorem]]'''
:: <math>(x+y)^n=\sum_{k=0}^n{n \choose k}x^ky^{n-k},</math>

:holds whenever ''x'' and ''y'' commute ([[Binomial_theorem#Proof|see this]] for a [[mathematical proof|proof]]). The theorem holds for arbitrary ''x'' and ''y'' in a [[commutative ring]].

==Basic concepts==
===Zero ring===

{{Main|Zero ring}}

Let (''R'', +, ⋅) be a ring. Then (''R'', +, ⋅) is said to be a '''[[zero ring]]''' if the product of any two elements in ''R'' is 0 (the additive identity).

'''Note'''

* If we assume that rings have multiplicative identities, then a ring is zero if and only if it is trivial. Therefore, the concept of a zero ring is only interesting when one deals with rings that are only [[semigroup]]s under multiplication (that is, do not necessarily have a multiplicative identity).

'''Example'''

* Any [[Abelian group]] can be turned into a zero ring by letting ''a'' ⋅ ''b'' = 0 for every ''a'', ''b'' in the group (and letting + be the group operation of that Abelian group).

===Units===

{{Main|Unit (ring theory)}}

An element ''a'' of a ring (''R'', +, ⋅) need not necessarily have a multiplicative inverse (for example, in the ring of all integers, 2 has no multiplicative inverse). An element ''a'' in a ring is called a '''[[unit (ring theory)|unit]]''' if it is invertible with respect to multiplication. Formally,

'''Formal definition'''

Let (''R'', +, ⋅) be a ring. An element ''a'' of (''R'', +, ⋅) is said to be a '''[[unit]]''' in (''R'', +, ⋅)  if there is an element ''b'' in the ring such that ''a'' · ''b''&nbsp;= ''b'' · ''a''&nbsp;= 1. 

'''Notes'''

* Using [[elementary group theory]], one can deduce that ''b'' is uniquely determined by ''a'' so let ''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>&nbsp;= ''b''. 

* The set of all units in (''R'', +, ⋅) forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under ring multiplication; this group is denoted by ''U''(''R'') or ''R''*.

'''Examples'''

* Every non-zero element in the ring of all real numbers (('''R''', +, ⋅)) is a unit in this ring. In fact, one can define a [[field]] ([[Ring_(mathematics)#Integral_domains_and_fields|see below]]) to be a [[commutative ring]] such that every non-zero element is a unit. Therefore, ('''R''', +, ⋅) forms a field.

===Opposite ring===

* Let (''R'', +, ⋅) be a ring. The opposite ring, (''R''<sup>op</sup>, +, *) is defined by ''a'' * ''b'' = ''b'' ⋅ ''a''. Addition on the opposite ring is defined to be the same as addition on the original ring.

'''Note'''

* If a ring (''R'', +, ⋅) is commutative, then it is isomorphic to its opposite ring. The isomorphism is given by the identity map (in the [[category of sets]]).

'''Examples'''

* If the opposite ring of a ring (''R'', +, ⋅) is commutative, then so is the original ring.

* Consider the opposite ring of the opposite ring; that is ''R''<sup>op<sup>op</sup></sup>. Note that, ''R''<sup>op<sup>op</sup></sup> = ''R'' so that the [[functor|operation on rings]], taking any ring to its 'opposite' is [[involutory]]. 

* Note that, in particular, the above example shows that one can define a natural [[functor]] from the [[Category|category of ring]]s to itself.

* If two rings ''R''<sub>1</sub> and ''R''<sub>2</sub> are isomorphic, then their corresponding opposite rings are also isomorphic.

===Ring homomorphisms===

{{Main|Ring homomorphism}}

A [[homomorphism]] of rings is a function ''f'': ''R''<sub>1</sub> → ''R''<sub>2</sub> between two rings ''R''<sub>1</sub> and ''R''<sub>2</sub> preserving the ring operations, in the sense that for all ''a'', ''b'' in ''R''<sub>1</sub> the following identities are required to hold:

* ''f''(''a'' + ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') + ''f''(''b'')

* ''f''(''a'' ⋅ ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') ⋅ ''f''(''b'')

* ''f'' (1<sub>''R''<sub>1</sub></sub>) = 1<sub>''R''<sub>2</sub></sub>

As in any [[category (mathematics)|category]] a map ''f'' possessing an inverse ''g'': ''R''<sub>2</sub> → ''R''<sub>1</sub>, i.e. a map in the opposite direction such that the two [[function composition|compositions]] ''f'' ○ ''g'' and ''g'' ○ ''f'' equal the [[identity map]] of ''R''<sub>2</sub> and ''R''<sub>1</sub>, respectively, is called an [[isomorphism]]. Equivalently, ''f'' is [[bijective]].

For any ring ''R'' with unit element, there is a natural map '''Z''' → ''R'', it maps any positive ''n'' to the ''n''-fold sum of the unit element of ''R'', and &minus;''n'' to the additive inverse of {{nowrap|''n'' &middot; 1<sub>''R''</sub>}}. The [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of ''R'' can be expressed in terms of this map.

===Subrings===

{{Main|Subring}}

Informally, a '''[[subring]]''' is a ring, (''S'', +, ⋅), contained in a bigger one, (''R'', +, ⋅).<ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.1, p. 90}}</ref> More formally, let (''R'', +, ⋅) be a ring. A [[subset]] ''S'' of ''R'' is said to be a '''[[subring]]''' of ''R'' if:

* For every ''a'', ''b'' in ''S'', ''a'' + ''b'' is in ''S''

* For every ''a'', ''b'' in ''S'', ''a'' ⋅ ''b'' is in ''S''

* For every ''a'' in ''S'', &minus;''a'' (the additive inverse of ''a'' in ''R'') is in ''S''

* The multiplicative identity of ''R'' is in ''S'', i.e 1 is in ''S''

If ''S'' is a subring of ''R'', then ''S'' is a ring in its own right with + and ⋅ [[restricted function|restricted]] to the [[cartesian product]] ''S'' X ''S''.

'''Examples'''

* Suppose <math>f : R_1 \to R_2\,</math> is a ring morphism. Then the image, ''f'' (''R''<sub>1</sub>) is a subring of ''R''<sub>2</sub>.

* If ''A'' is a subring of ''R'' and ''B'' is a subring of ''R'' such that ''B'' is a [[subset]] of ''A'', then ''B'' is a subring of ''A''.

===Ideals===

{{Main|Ideal (ring theory)}}

The purpose of an '''[[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]''' in a ring is to somehow allow one to define the [[quotient ring]] of a ring (analagous to the [[quotient group]] of a [[group]]; [[Ring_(mathematics)#Quotient_ring|see below]]). An ideal in a ring can therefore be thought of as a generalization of a [[normal subgroup]] in a group. More formally, let (''R'', +, ⋅) be a ring. A [[subset]] ''I'' of ''R'' is said to be a '''[[Ideal (ring theory)|right ideal]]''' in ''R'' if:

* (''I'', +) is a subgroup of the underlying additive group in (''R'', +, ⋅) (i.e (''I'', +) is a subgroup of (''R'', +)).

* For every ''x'' in ''I'' and ''r'' in ''R'', ''x'' ⋅ ''r'' is in ''I''.

A '''[[Ideal (ring theory)|left ideal]]''' is similarly defined with the second condition being replaced. More specifically, a subset ''I'' of ''R'' is a left ideal in ''R'' if:

* (''I'', +) is a subgroup of the underlying additive group in (''R'', +, ⋅) (i.e (''I'', +) is a subgroup of (''R'', +)).

* For every ''x'' in ''I'' and ''r'' in ''R'', ''r'' ⋅ ''x'' is in ''I''.

'''Notes'''

* If ''k'' is in ''R'', then ''k'' ⋅ ''R'' is a right ideal in ''R'', and ''R'' ⋅ ''k'' is a left ideal in ''R''. These ideals (for any ''k'' in ''R'') are called the '''[[principal ideal|principal]]''' right and left ideals generated by ''p''.

* If every ideal in a ring (''R'', +, ⋅) is a principal ideal in (''R'', +, ⋅), (''R'', +, ⋅) is said to be a '''[[principal ideal ring]]'''.

* An ideal in a ring, (''R'', +, ⋅), is said to be a ''two-sided ideal'' if it is both a left ideal and right ideal in (''R'', +, ⋅). It is preferred to call a two-sided ideal, simply an ''ideal''.

* If ''I'' = {0} (where 0 is the additive identity of the ring (''R'', +, ⋅)), then ''I'' is an ideal known as the ''trivial ideal''. Similarly, ''R'' is also an ideal in (''R'', +, ⋅) called the ''[[unit ideal]]''.

'''Examples'''

* Any additive subgroup of the integers is an ideal in the integers with its natural ring structure.

* There are no non-trivial ideals in '''R''' (the ring of all real numbers) (i.e, the only ideals in '''R''' are {0} and '''R''' itself). More generally, a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] cannot contain any non-trivial ideals.

* From the previous example, every field must be a principal ideal ring.

* A subset, ''I'', of a ''commutative ring'' (''R'', +, ⋅) is a left ideal [[iff|if and only if]] it is a right ideal. So for simplicity's sake, we refer to any ideal in a commutative ring as just an ''ideal''.

===Quotient ring===

{{Main|Quotient ring}}

Informally, the '''[[quotient ring]]''' of a ring, is a generalization of the notion of a [[quotient group]] of a group. More formally, given a ring (''R'', +, ⋅) and an [[Ideal (ring theory)|two-sided ideal]] ''I'' of (''R'', +, ⋅), the '''[[quotient ring]]''' (or '''factor ring''') ''R''/''I'' is the set of cosets of ''I'' (with respect to the underlying additive group of (''R'', +, ⋅); i.e cosets with respect to (''R'', +)) together with the operations:

:(''a'' + ''I'')  + (''b'' + ''I'') = (''a'' + ''b'') + ''I'' and
:(''a'' + ''I'')(''b'' + ''I'') = (''ab'') + ''I''.

For every ''a'', ''b'' in ''R''.

===Direct product of rings===

{{Main|Direct product of rings}}

Let ''R'' and ''S'' be rings. Then the product ''R'' X ''S'' can be equipped with the following natural ring structure:

* (''r''<sub>1</sub>, ''s''<sub>1</sub>) + (''r''<sub>2</sub>, ''s''<sub>2</sub>) = (''r''<sub>1</sub> + ''r''<sub>2</sub>, ''s''<sub>1</sub> + ''s''<sub>2</sub>) 

* (''r''<sub>1</sub>, ''s''<sub>1</sub>) ⋅ (''r''<sub>2</sub>, ''s''<sub>2</sub>) = (''r''<sub>1</sub> ⋅ ''r''<sub>2</sub>, ''s''<sub>1</sub> ⋅ ''s''<sub>2</sub>)

for every ''r''<sub>1</sub>, ''r''<sub>2</sub> in ''R'' and ''s''<sub>1</sub>, ''s''<sub>2</sub> in ''S''. The ring ''R'' X ''S'' with the above operations of addition and operation (derived from ''R'' and ''S'') is called the '''[[Direct product of rings|direct product]]''' of ''R'' with ''S''. By repeating this process ''n'' times with ''n'' rings, one can form what is known as the '''''n''-fold product''' of rings. The product is natural because the [[quotient ring]] ''R'' X ''S'' / ''R'' is isomorphic to ''S'' and similarly ''R'' X ''S'' / ''S'' is isomorphic to ''R''.

===Center of a ring===

{{Main|Center of a ring}}
There are various notions to address the non-commutativity of general rings ''R''. The ''center'' consists of the ring elements that commute with every other element:
:''C'' = {''c'' in ''R'' | ''c'' ⋅ ''x'' = ''x'' ⋅ ''c'' for every ''x'' in ''R''}
It is a subring of ''R''.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} A subring of ''R'' is said to be ''central'' in ''R'', if it is a subset of ''C'' (and therefore a subring of ''C'').

===Boolean rings===

{{Main|Boolean ring}}
A ring ''R'' is called ''Boolean ring'' if every ring element ''a'' is an [[idempotent]], i.e. ''a'' ⋅ ''a'' = ''a''. For example, the (unique) [[two-element Boolean algebra|ring with two elements]] has this property. Their is a one-to-one correspondence between [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s and Boolean rings, by expressing [[set difference]] and [[set intersection]] in terms of addition and multiplication and vice versa. Any Boolean ring is commutative and of characteristic two, i.e. ''a'' + ''a'' = 0 for all ''a'' in ''R''. 
[[Image:Venn3.GIF|center|500px|thumb|Venn diagrams for the Boolean operations of conjunction, disjunction, and complement]]

===Endomorphism rings===

{{Main|Endomorphism ring}}

Let (''A'', +) be an [[Abelian group]] and let ''E'' be the set of all [[endomorphism]]s of ''A'' (that is, the set of all group morphisms from ''A'' to itself) . If ''f'' and ''g'' belong to ''E'', then define ''f'' + ''g'' to be the [[Function_(Mathematics)#Pointwise_operations|point-wise sum]] of ''f'' and ''g'' (with respect to the group operation). Similarly, define ''f'' ⋅ ''g'' = ''f'' o ''g'' (''f'' composed with ''g''). Then (''E'', +, ⋅) forms a ring known as the '''[[endomorphism ring]]''' of (''A'', +). 

'''Example'''

* Note that one can define a natural [[functor]] from the [[Category of abelian groups|category of Abelian groups]] ('''Ab''') to the [[category of rings]] using the notion of endomorphism rings.

* The endomorphism ring of an Abelian group is trivial [[iff|if and only if]] the Abelian group in question is the [[trivial group]].

More generally the endomorphism ring of any module is an important ring when studying the module.  Every ring arises as the endomorphism ring of a module, the regular module.  Conversely an ''R''-module ''M'' is nothing more than a ring homomorphism from the ring ''R'' into the endomorphism ring of the underlying additive group of ''M''.  Properties of modules such as [[indecomposable module|indecomposable]] and strongly indecomposable are often defined in terms of the module's associated endomorphism ring.

===Tensor product of rings===

{{Main|Tensor product of rings}}

* Since any ring is both a left and right [[module (mathematics)|module]] over itself, it is possible to construct the [[tensor product of rings|tensor product]] of ''R'' over a ring ''S'' with another ring ''T'' to get another ring provided ''S'' is a central subring of ''R'' and ''T''.

==Examples and applications==
===Numbers===

{{Main|Number system}}

Many [[number system]]s such as the [[integer]]s, [[rational number]]s, [[real number]]s and the [[complex number]]s naturally occur as rings. Note that in the case of the rational, real and complex numbers, every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. These number systems (except for the integers) form what is known as a [[field]] ([[Ring_(mathematics)#Integral_domains_and_fields|see below]] or at the top of the article for a comparison between fields and rings).

===Rationals===

{{Main|Rational number}}

The desire for the existence of multiplicative inverses in the ring of all integers ([[Ring_(mathematics)#First_example:_the_integers|see above]]) suggests considering [[fraction]]s
:<math alt="a/b">\frac{a}{b}.</math>
Fractions of integers (with ''b'' nonzero) are known as [[rational number]]s.{{cref|d}} The [[set]] of all such fractions is commonly denoted by '''Q'''. Note that the set of all rationals form a ring under the natural operations of addition and multiplication. In fact, the rationals satisfy a stronger axiom than the integers now that we have included fractions: namely, every ''non-zero rational'' has a multiplicative inverse, its [[reciprocal]]. Because of this, along with the fact that multiplication on the rationals is [[commutative ring|commutative]] ([[Ring_(mathematics)#Commutative ring|see above]]), the rationals form what is known as a [[field]] ([[Ring_(mathematics)#Integral_domains_and_fields|see below]]) <ref>{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §III.1, p. 86}}</ref>. Fields are central [[mathematical object|objects]] to [[abstract algebra]].

===Nonzero integers modulo a prime===
===Polynomial rings===

{{Main|Polynomial ring}}

* The [[polynomial ring]] ''R''[''X''] of polynomials over a ring ''R'' is also a ring.
** The set of [[formal power series]]  ''R''<nowiki>[[</nowiki>''X''<sub>1</sub>, …, ''X''<sub>''n''</sub><nowiki>]]</nowiki> over a commutative ring ''R'' is a ring.

==Some examples of the ubiquity of rings==

It is remarkable how many different kinds of [[mathematical object]]s can be fruitfully analyzed in terms of some [[functor|associated ring]].  For instance:

* To any [[topological space]] ''X'' one can associate its integral [[cohomology ring]] <math>H^*(X,\mathbb{Z}) = \bigoplus_{i=0}^{\infty} H^i(X,\mathbb{Z})</math>, a [[graded ring]].  As the name suggests, there are also [[homology group]]s <math>H_i(X,\mathbb{Z})</math> of a space, and indeed these were defined first, as a useful tool for distinguishing between certain pairs of topological spaces, like the [[sphere]]s and [[torus|tori]], for which the methods of [[point-set topology]] are not well-suited.  [[Cohomology group]]s were later defined in terms of homology groups in a way which is roughly analogous to the dual of a [[vector space]].  To know each individual integral homology group is essentially the same as knowing each individual integral cohomology group, because of the [[universal coefficient theorem]].  However, the advantage of the cohomology groups is that there is a [[cup product|natural product]], which is analogous to the observation that one can multiply pointwise a ''k''-[[multilinear form]] and an ''l''-multilinear form to get a (''k'' + ''l'')-mulilinear form.  The importance of the ring structure in cohomology is hard to overstate: it provides the foundation for [[characteristic class]]es of [[fiber bundle]]s, intersection theory on manifolds and [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]], [[Schubert calculus]] and much more.
* To any [[group (mathematics)|group]] is associated its [[Burnside ring]] which uses a ring to describe the various ways the group can [[group action|act]] on a finite set.  The Burnside ring's additive group is the [[free abelian group]] whose basis are the transitive actions of the group and whose addition is the disjoint union of the action.  Expressing an action in terms of the basis is decomposing an action into its transitive constituents.  The multiplication is easily expressed in terms of the [[representation ring]]: the multiplication in the Burnside ring is formed by writing the tensor product of two permutation modules as a permutation module.  The ring structure allows a formal way of subtracting one action from another.  Since the Burnside ring is contained as a finite index subring of the representation ring, one can pass easily from one to the other by extending the coefficients from integers to the rational numbers.
* To any [[group ring]] or [[Hopf algebra]] is associated its [[representation ring]] or "Green ring".  The representation ring's additive group is the free abelian group whose basis are the indecomposable modules and whose addition corresponds to the direct sum.  Expressing a module in terms of the basis is finding an indecomposable decomposition of the module.  The multiplication is the tensor product.  When the algebra is semisimple, the representation ring is just the character ring from [[character theory]], which is more or less the [[Grothendieck group]] given a ring structure.
* To any irreducible [[algebraic variety]] is associated its [[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]].  The points of an algebraic variety correspond to [[valuation ring]]s contained in the function field and containing the [[coordinate ring]].  The study of [[algebraic geometry]] makes heavy use of [[commutative algebra]] to study geometric concepts in terms of ring-theoretic properties.  [[Birational geometry]] studies maps between the subrings of the function field.
* Every [[simplicial complex]] has an associated face ring, also called its [[Stanley–Reisner ring]].  This ring reflects many of the combinatorial properties of the simplicial complex, so it is of particular interest in [[algebraic combinatorics]].  In particular, the algebraic geometry of the Stanley–Reisner ring was used to characterize the numbers of faces in each dimension of [[simplicial polytope]]s.

==Rings with additional structure==
===Lie rings===

{{Main|Lie ring}}

A '''[[Lie ring]]''' is defined to be a ring that is [[nonassociative ring|nonassociative]] and [[anticommutative]] under multiplication, that also satisfies the [[Jacobi identity]]. More specifically we can define a Lie ring <math>L</math> to be an [[abelian group]] under addition with an operation <math>[\cdot,\cdot]</math> that has the following properties:

* ''[[Bilinearity]]'':

::<math> [x + y, z] = [x, z] + [y, z], \quad  [z, x + y] = [z, x] + [z, y] </math>

:for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' &isin; ''L''.

* ''[[Jacobi identity]]'':

:: <math> [x,[y,z]] + [y,[z,x]] + [z,[x,y]] = 0 \quad </math>

:for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''L''.

* For all ''x'' in ''L''.

::<math> [x,x]=0 \quad </math>

Lie rings need not be [[Lie group]]s under addition.  Any [[Lie algebra]] is an example of a Lie ring.  Any associative ring can be made into a Lie ring by defining a bracket operator <math>[x,y] = xy - yx</math>.  Conversely to any Lie algebra there is a corresponding ring, called the [[universal enveloping algebra]].

Lie rings are used in the study of finite [[p-group]]s through the Lazard correspondence.  The lower central factors of a ''p''-group are finite abelian ''p''-groups, so modules over '''Z'''/''p'''''Z'''.  The direct sum of the lower central factors is given the structure of a Lie ring by defining the bracket to be the [[commutator]] of two coset representatives.  The Lie ring structure is enriched with another module homomorphism, then ''p''th power map, making the associated Lie ring a so-called restricted Lie ring.

Lie rings are also useful in the definition of a [[p-adic analytic group]]s and their endomorphisms by studying Lie algebras over rings of integers such as the [[p-adic integers]].  The definition of finite groups of Lie type due to Chevalley involves restricting from a Lie algebra over the complex numbers to a Lie algebra over the integers, and the reducing modulo ''p'' to get a Lie algebra over a finite field.

===Topological ring===

{{Main|Topological ring|Topological group}}

Let (''X'', ''T'') is a [[topological space]] and (''X'', +, ⋅) be a ring. Then (''X'', ''T'', +, ⋅) is said to be a '''[[topological ring]]''', if its ring structure and topological structure are both compatible (i.e work together) over each other. That is, the addition map ( <math>+ : X\times X \to X\,</math>) and the multiplication map ( <math>\cdot : X\times X \to X\,</math>) have to be both [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous]] as maps between topological spaces where ''X'' x ''X'' inherits the [[product topology]]. So clearly, any topological ring is a [[topological group]] (under addition).

'''Examples'''

* The set of all real numbers, '''R''', with its natural ring structure and the [[standard topology]] forms a topological ring.

* The direct product of two topological rings is also a topological ring.

===Integral domains and fields===

{{Main|Integral domain|Field}}

While rings are very important mathematical objects, there are a lot of restrictions involved in their theory. For instance, suppose we have a ring ''R'' and suppose ''a'' and ''b'' are in ''R''. If ''a'' is non-zero and ''a'' ⋅ ''b'' = 0, then ''b'' need not necessarily be 0. In particular, if ''a'' ⋅ ''b'' = ''a'' ⋅ ''c'' with ''a'' non-zero ''b'' need not equal ''c''. An example of this is the set of ''n'' x ''n'' matrices over '''R''' where ''a'' maybe such a non-zero matrix but may be [[singular matrix|singular]]. In this case, the result may not be true. However, we can impose additional conditions on the ring to ensure that this be true; namely make the ring into an '''[[integral domain]]''' (that is a non-trivial [[commutative ring]] with no [[zero divisor]]s). But we still run into a problem; namely we can't necessarily divide by non-zero elements. For example, the collection of all integers form an integral domain but we still can't divide an integer ''a'' by another integer ''b''. For example, 2 cannot divide 3 to obtain another element in this ring. However, this problem can readily be solved if we ensure that every element in the ring has a multiplicative inverse. A '''[[field]]''' is a ring in which the non-zero elements form an [[Abelian group]] under multiplication. In particular, a field is an integral domain (and therefore has no zero divisors) along with an additional operation of 'division'. Namely, if ''a'' and ''b'' are in a field '''F''', then ''a''/''b'' is defined to be ''a'' ⋅ ''b''<sup>-1</sup> which is well defined. 

'''Formal definition'''

Let (''R'', +, ⋅) be a ring. Then (''R'', +, ⋅) is said to be an '''[[integral domain]]''' if (''R'', +, ⋅) is commutative and has no [[zero divisor]]s. Furthermore, (''R'', +, ⋅) is said to be a '''[[field]]''', if its non-zero elements form an [[Abelian group]] under multiplication.

'''Note'''

* If we require that the ''zero element'' (0) in a ring to have a multiplicative inverse, then the ring must be [[trivial ring|trivial]]. 

'''Examples'''

* The integers form a commutative ring under the natural operations of addition and multiplication. In fact, the integers form what is known as an '''[[integral domain]]''' (a commutative ring with no [[zero divisor]]s).

* A ring whose non-zero elements form an [[Abelian group]] under multiplication (not just a [[commutative monoid]]), is called a '''[[field]]'''. So every field is an integral domain and every integral domain is a commutative ring. Furthermore, any finite integral domain is a field.

====Relation to other algebraic structures====

The following is a chain of [[subclass (set theory)|class inclusions]] that describes the relationship between rings, domains and fields:

* '''[[Commutative ring]]s''' ⊃ '''[[integral domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[unique factorization domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[principal ideal domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[Euclidean domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[field (mathematics)|field]]s'''

Fields and integral domains are very important in modern algebra.

==Category theoretical description==

Note that every ring is an [[Abelian group]] and every [[morphism]] of rings is a morphism of the underlying Abelian groups. Therefore, rings can be thought of as [[monoid (category theory)|monoid]]s in '''Ab''', the [[category of abelian groups]] (thought of as a [[monoidal category]] under the [[tensor product of abelian groups|tensor product]]). The monoid action of a ring ''R'' on a abelian group is simply an [[module (mathematics)|''R''-module]].

It follows that a ring may be regarded as a [[preadditive category]] (a category [[enriched category|enriched]] over '''Ab''') with a single object. Here the [[morphism]]s are the ring elements, composition of morphisms is ring multiplication, and the additive structure on morphisms is ring addition. The opposite ring is then the [[categorical dual]].
