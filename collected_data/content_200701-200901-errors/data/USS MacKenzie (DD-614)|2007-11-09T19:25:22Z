'''USS ''MacKenzie'' (DD-614)''' was a [[Benson class destroyer|''Benson''-class]] [[destroyer]] in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. She was named for [[Alexander Slidell MacKenzie]].

The third ''MacKenzie'' was laid down [[29 May]] [[1941]] by the [[Bethlehem Steel Corporation]], [[San Pedro, California]]; launched [[27 June]] [[1942]]; sponsored by Miss Gail Nielsen, descendant of Lt. Comdr. Alexander S. MacKenzie; and commissioned [[21 November]] 1942, Commander [[D. B. Miller]] in command.

''MacKenzie'' transited the [[Panama Canal]] 1 March 1943, after completion of shakedown and training cruises, and continued on to spend her entire World War II career in the Atlantic and Mediterranean theaters. She arrived at [[Casco Bay]], [[Maine]], 13 March and commenced coastwise escort duties. In May, she graduated to transatlantic convoy assignments, completing two voyages to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] by the end of June. On 16 May, she made two depth charge attacks on a [[sonar]] contact; postwar review of [[Germany|German]] records proved them successful in the sinking of [[Unterseeboot 182|U-182]].

Relieved of transatlantic duties at the end of June, she reported to the staging area for the “Cent” Attack Force, one of three such forces to initiate the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] campaign. On 9 July she departed the north African coast, arriving at [[Scoglitti]], Sicily, the next day to screen the transport vessels and provide fire support. Three days later, the destroyer returned to convoy duty, conducting convoys between the United States and the Mediterranean until 7 October, and then engaging in escort work between North America and the [[United Kingdom]]. After repairs at [[Swansea]], [[England]], in the late autumn, she made two more ocean crossings before beginning operations in the Mediterranean.

On 18 March 1944, ''MacKenzie'' steamed into the harbor at [[Naples]] to report for screening, fire support and antisubmarine patrol duties in conjunction with the [[Anzio]] operation. Starting her Anzio assignments with an assist in the sinking of a two-man submarine on the 19th, she continued to provide support on this front until resuming convoy duties 6 June. Taking up the offensive again in August, ''MacKenzie'' took part in [[Operation Anvil]], providing fire support for this invasion of southern [[France]]. On 15 September, she departed the Mediterranean and headed for [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and a 5-month repair and overhaul period.

The destroyer took up duty in the Mediterranean again in February 1945 and from 28 March through 21 April spent her days in the bombardment of the Franco-Italian border and her nights on the blockade of the [[Gulf of Genoa]]. In May, having assisted in the continuance of an effective second front, ''MacKenzie'' was assigned to convoy duty in the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. She remained in the Mediterranean after the capitulation of the [[Third Reich]], cruising its waters until returning to the United States in July.

Upon her arrival, ''MacKenzie'' underwent overhaul preparatory to going to the Pacific. But, with the end of Pacific hostilities in mid-August, her orders were changed and on 4 November she entered the [[Charleston Navy Yard]] for inactivation. She decommissioned [[4 February]] [[1946]] and in January 1947 entered the reserve fleet at [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. She was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on [[1 July]] [[1971]] and sunk in fleet exercises on [[1 June]] [[1974]]. 

''MacKenzie'' received four [[battle star]]s for World War II service.
