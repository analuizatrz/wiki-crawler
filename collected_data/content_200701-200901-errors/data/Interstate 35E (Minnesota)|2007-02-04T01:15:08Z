'''Interstate 35E''' (abbreviated '''I-35E'''), an [[interstate highway]], is the eastern half of [[Interstate 35]] where it splits to serve different cities in [[Minnesota]]. I-35 splits into two branch routes, [[Interstate 35W (Minnesota)|I-35W]] and I-35E at [[Lakeville, Minnesota|Lakeville]]. I-35E runs north for 41 miles (66 km), maintaining I-35's sequence of exit numbers. It runs through [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] before rejoining with I-35W to reform I-35 in [[Columbus, Minnesota|Columbus]]. 

Historically, other interstates were given directional suffixes. On every other interstate, the directional suffixes were phased out by giving the route a loop or spur designation. In the case of I-35, since both branches return to a unified interstate beyond the twin cities of St. Paul and [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], the [[AASHTO]] committees allowed the suffixes to remain.

==Cities==
Bolded cities are officially-designated [[control cities]] for signs.

==Intersections with other Interstates and other main roads==
*Interstate 35 splits into I-35E and I-35W in [[Burnsville, Minnesota]]
*[[Interstate 494]] in [[Mendota Heights, Minnesota]]
*[[Interstate 94]] in downtown [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]
*[[Interstate 694]] in [[Little Canada, Minnesota]] 
*Interstate 35 reforms from I-35E and I-35W in [[Columbus, Minnesota]]

==Notes==
*The [[road junction|interchange]] with [[Interstate 694]] has the two roads briefly merging together and [[Grade_separation#Weaving|weaving]] before separating. An [[Road#Maintenance|construction]] project to untangle these two highways is currently underway and is due to be completed in [[2008]]. [http://www.dot.state.mn.us/metro/projects/i35e_694/]

*No direct access from I-35E to I-35W is provided at either the southern or northern termini, although traffic from southbound I-35E can reach northbound I-35W via surface streets just before the southbound terminus.

*The interchange between I-35E and I-94 in downtown St. Paul is incomplete, in that there is no direct access provided between I-94 eastbound and I-35E southbound or between I-35E northbound and I-94 westbound.  These moves must be done using Kellogg Boulevard.  This probably resulted because of the number of buildings in the vicinity.  Also, I-35E and I-94 share a short duplex section between St. Peter Street and Jackson Street, but fortunately, no weaving is required.

*The segment from [[Minnesota State Highway 5|MN-5]] to I-94 in downtown St. Paul was delayed for over 15 years due to litigation between local residents and the [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]].  A court settlement eventually resulted in the construction of a "parkway" section, which included a truck prohibition and a maximum speed limit of 45mph (presumably to control noise).  Legislation has been proposed over the years to lift these restrictions, but they have not passed due to continued local opposition.

*The route of I-35E is part of Route 390 in Minnesota Statutes ยง 161.12(6), [http://ros.leg.mn/bin/getpub.php?pubtype=STAT_CHAP_SEC&year=2006&section=161.12] but is not signed as such.
