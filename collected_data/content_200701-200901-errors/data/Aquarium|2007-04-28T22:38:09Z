An '''aquarium''' (plural ''aquariums'' or ''aquaria'') is a [[vivarium]] consisting of at least one transparent side in which [[water]]-dwelling [[plant]]s or [[animal]]s are kept. Aquaria are primarily used for [[fishkeeping]], although [[invertebrate]]s, [[amphibian]]s, and [[marine mammal]]s are also housed in aquaria. The term combines the Latin root ''aqua'', meaning water, with the suffix ''-arium'', meaning "a place for relating to".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/aquarium | title = Definition of aquarium | publisher = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary | accessdate = 2007-04-03 }}</ref>

The aquarium has a long history and maintaining an aquarium has become immensely popular worldwide. Aquaria can come in a variety of materials, shapes, and sizes. They are typically constructed of [[glass]] or high-strength [[plastic]]. [[Cuboid]] aquaria are also known as '''fish tanks''' or simply '''tanks''', while [[bowl (vessel)|bowl]]-shaped aquaria are also known as '''fish bowls'''. Size can range from a small glass bowl to immense public aquaria. A number of components are used to maintain appropriate water quality and characteristics suitable for the aquarium's residents. There are many types of aquaria, classified by the organisms maintained or the type of environment that is mimicked.

== History and popularization ==
[[fishkeeping|Keeping fish]] in artificial environments has existed for centuries. In imperial [[Rome]], the first fish to be brought indoors was the [[sea barbel]], kept in small tanks made of marble under guest beds. With the introduction of glass panes around 50&nbsp;AD, the Romans replaced one wall of the marble tank, improving their view of the fish. In 1369, the Chinese Emperor [[Hongwu]] established a [[porcelain]] company that produced large porcelain tubs for maintaing [[goldfish]]; over time, these tubs were produced more and more like modern fish bowls.<ref>{{cite book | last = Brunner | first = Bernd | title = The Ocean at Home | publisher = Princeton Architectural Press | date = 2003 | location = New York | isbn = 1-56898-502-9 | pages = 21-22}}</ref> In 1665 the diarist [[Samuel Pepys]] recorded seeing in [[London]] "a fine rarity, of fishes kept in a glass of water, that will live so forever, and finely marked they are, being foreign."{{Fact|date=April 2007}} The fish observed by Pepys were likely to have been the [[paradise fish]], ''Macropodus opercularis'', a familiar garden fish in [[Guangzhou]] (Canton), China, where the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] was then trading.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} Leonhard Baldner, who wrote ''Vogel-, Fisch- und Tierbuch'' (Bird, Fish, and Animal Book) in 1666, maintained [[weather loach]]es and [[newt]]s.<ref>Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', page 25</ref>

In 1836, soon after his invention of the [[Wardian case]], Ward proposed to use his tanks for tropical animals, and in 1841 he did so, though only with aquatic plants and toy fish. However, real animals were soon housed.  In 1838, [[Félix Dujardin]] noted owning a [[saltwater aquarium]] (though he didn't use this term).<ref name=Brunner35>Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', page 35</ref> In 1846, Anna Thynne maintained [[stony coral]]s and [[seaweed]] for almost three years, and was credited as the creator of the first balanced marine aquarium in London.<ref>Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', pages 35-36</ref> At about the same time, Robert Warington experimented with a thirteen gallon container, goldfish, [[eelgrass]], and [[snail]]s, creating one of the first stable aquaria; he published his findings in 1850 in the [[Chemical Society]]'s [[scientific journal|journal]].<ref>Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', page 36</ref>
[[Image:Pike aquarium c1908.jpg|thumb|right|[[Esox|Pike]] in an aquarium [[circa|c.]][[1908]], at the Detroit Aquarium, Belle Isle Park, USA.]]
The keeping of fish in an aquarium became a popular hobby and spread quickly. In the United Kingdom, it became popular after ornate aquaria in cast iron frames were featured at the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] of 1851. In 1853, the first large public aquarium opened in the [[London Zoological Gardens]] and came to be known as the Fish House.<ref>Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', pages 99</ref> [[Philip Henry Gosse]] was the first person to actually use the word "aquarium", opting for this term (instead of "vivarium") in 1854 in his book ''The Aquarium: An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Sea''. In this book, Gosse primarily discussed saltwater aquaria.<ref>Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', page 38</ref> In the 1850s, the aquarium became a fad in Britain.<ref>Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', page 57</ref>

Germans soon rivaled the British in their interest. In 1854, two articles about the saltwater aquaria of Britain were published in ''Die Gartenlaube'' (The Garden House) entitled ''Der Ocean auf dem Tische'' (The Ocean on the Table) by an anonymous author. However, in 1856, ''Der See im Glase'' (The Lake in a Glass) was published, discussing freshwater aquaria, which were much easier to maintain in landlocked areas.<ref>Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', pages 60-61</ref> During the 1870s, some of the first [[Aquarium fish clubs|aquarist socities]] were appearing in Germany.<ref name=Brunner75>Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', page 75</ref> The United States soon joined. Published in 1858, Henry D. Butler's ''The Family Aquarium'' was one of the first books written in the United States solely about the aquarium.<ref>Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', page 69</ref> According to the July issue ''The North American Review'' of the same year, William Stimson may have owned some of the first functional aquaria, as many as seven or eight.<ref>Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', page 71</ref> The first aquarist society in the United States was founded in [[New York City]] in 1893, followed by others.<ref name=Brunner75/> The ''New York Aquarium Journal'' first published in October 1876 is considered to be the world's first aquarium magazine.<ref>Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', pages 76-77</ref>

In [[Victorian]] England a common design for the home aquarium was a glass front with the other sides made of wood (made watertight with a [[pitch (resin)|pitch]] coating). The bottom would be made of [[slate]] and heated from below.<ref name=Sanford>{{cite book | title = Aquarium Owner's Guide | last = Sanford | first = Gina | publisher = [[DK Publishing]] | location = New York | date = 1999 | pages = 9-13 | isbn = 0-7894-4614-6}}</ref> More advanced systems soon began to be introduced, along with tanks of glass in metal frames.<ref name=Sanford/> During the later half of the 18th century, a variety of aquarium designs were explored, such as hanging the aquarium on a wall, mounting it as part of a [[window]], or even combining it with a [[birdcage]].<ref>Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', pages 86-89</ref> 

Aquaria became more widely popular as houses became almost universally electrified after [[World War I]].  With [[electricity]] great improvements were made in aquarium technology, allowing artificial lighting as well as [[aeration]], [[filtration]], and heating of the water.<ref>Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', page 93</ref> Initially, amateur aquarists kept native fish (with the exception of goldfish); the entrance of exotic species from overseas also allowed aquaria to become even more popular.<ref>Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', page 78</ref> Jugs made from a variety of materials were initially used to import fish from overseas, including innovations such as using a [[bicycle pump|bicycle foot pump]] for aeration.<ref>Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', pages 82-83</ref> Plastic shipping bags were introduced in the 1950s, making it easier to ship fish.<ref>Brunner, B: ''The Ocean at Home'', page 82</ref> The eventual availability of air freight, which allowed a much wider variety of fish to be successfully imported from distant regions of origin, consequently attracted new hobbyists.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} In the 1960s, a great breakthrough was reached. Metal frames made [[marine aquarium|marine aquaria]] almost impossible due to corrosion, but the development of [[silicone]] sealant allowed the first all-glass aquaria. The frames remained, however, though purely for aesthetic reasons.<ref name=Sanford/>

Aquarium keeping is now a popular hobby around the world, with about 60 million enthusiasts worldwide.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} In the USA, aquarium keeping is the second most popular hobby after [[stamp collecting]].<ref name="baensch">{{cite book |last=Riehl |first=Rüdiger. Editor. |coauthors=Baensch, HA |title=Aquarium Atlas |year=1996. 5th Edn. |publisher=Tetra Press |location=Germany |isbn=3-88244-050-3}}</ref> The number of fish kept in aquaria vary by country. In 1996, it was estimated that 100,000,000 fish were kept in aquaria in the USA. Similarly, estimates of the numbers of fish kept in aquaria Germany number at least 36,000,000.<ref name="baensch"/> The hobby has the strongest following in Europe, Asia, and North America. In the United States, 40% of aquarists maintain two or more tanks at any one time.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

== Design ==
[[Image:Aquarium 60cm.JPG|thumb|right|An 80 litre home aquarium.]]
=== Materials ===
Most aquaria consist of simple [[glass]] panes bonded together by [[silicone]]. Usually plastic frames are attached to the upper and lower edges for decoration. Price, availability, and reliability make the glass aquarium an industry standard for sizes up to about 1000&nbsp;[[litre]]s (250&nbsp;[[gallon|gal]]).  However, glass is brittle and has very little give before fracturing, though generally the sealant fails first.<ref name=Adey>{{citation|title=Dynamic Aquaria|last1 = Adey|first1 = Walter H.|last2 = Loveland|first2 = Karen|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|date=1991|isbn=0-12-043792-9}}</ref> Aquaria come in a variety of shapes such as [[cuboid]], [[hexagonal prism|hexagonal]], angled to fit in a corner (L-shaped), bow-front (the front side curves outwards), and more.<ref name=Sanford2>{{cite book | title = Aquarium Owner's Guide | last = Sanford | first = Gina | publisher = [[DK Publishing]] | location = New York | date = 1999 | pages = 162-169 | isbn = 0-7894-4614-6}}</ref> Fish bowls are generally either plastic or glass, either spherical or some other round configuration.

[[Acrylic]] aquaria are also available, and is the primary competitor with glass. Acrylics are not as strong as glass, but are much lighter. Acrylic-soluble cements are used to directly fuse acrylic together (as opposed to simply sealing the seam).<ref name=Adey/> Acrylic allows for the formation of unusual shapes, such as hexagonal.<ref name=Sanford/> Compared to glass, acrylics are easy to scratch; care must be taken with organisms with shells and teeth.<ref name=Adey/>

[[Laminated glass]] might be used, which combines the advantages of both glass and acrylic.<ref name=Adey/>

Large aquaria might use stronger materials such as [[fiberglass]]-reinforced [[plastic]]s. However, this material is not transparent.<ref name=Adey/> Reinforced [[concrete]] is used for aquaria where weight and space are not factors. Concrete must be coated with a waterproof layer to prevent the water from breaking down the concrete as well as prevent contamination from the concrete.<ref name=Adey/>

=== Styles ===
Aquaria can can come in more creative flavors. Aquariums have been fashioned into coffee tables, sinks, and even toilets. Another such example is the [[Macquarium]], an aquarium made from the shell of an [[Apple Macintosh]] [[computer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.tut.fi/~ace/macquarium.html|title=The Original MacQuarium|first=Andy|last=Ihnatko|date=1992|accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref> 

A '''kreisel tank''' is a [[circle|circular]] aquarium designed to hold delicate animals such as [[jellyfish]]. These aquariums provide slow, circular water flow with a lack of physical objects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.advancedaquarist.com/issues/dec2004/lines.htm|title=Delicatessen Part I: Creating a system for rare and delicate animals|last=Blundell|first=Adam|publisher=Advanced Aquarist's Online Magazine|date=December 2004|accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref> Originally a German design (''kreisel'' means spinning top), the tank is designed to have no sharp corners, and keeps the housed animals away from the [[plumbing]]. Water moving into the tank gives a gentle flow that keeps the inhabitants suspended, and water leaving the tank is covered by a delicate screen that prevents the inhabitants from getting stuck. There are several types of kreisel tanks. In a true kreisel, a perfectly circular tank has a circular, submerged, lid. Pseudokreisels, have a curved bottom surface and a top surface flat, similar to the shape of either a "U" or a [[semicircle]].<ref>{{cite web | author = Wrobel, Dave |url=http://jellieszone.com/captivejellies.htm|title=Captive Jellies: Keeping Jellies in an Aquarium | publisher = The Jellies Zone |accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref> It is possible to combine these designs; a circular shaped tank is used without a lid or cover, and the surface of the water acts as the continuation of circular flow.

===Aquarium size and volume===
[[Image:Whale Shark at Osaka Aquarium.jpg|thumb|right|A large aquarium at the [[Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan|Osaka Aquarium]] houses a [[whale shark]].]]
An aquarium can range from a small glass bowl containing less than a [[litre]] (34&nbsp;[[Fluid ounce|fl.oz.]]) of water to immense public aquaria which can house entire ecosystems such as [[kelp forest]]s. Larger aquaria are typically recommended to hobbyists due to their resistance to rapid fluctuations of temperature and [[pH]], allowing for greater system stability.<ref name=Sanford2/>

Aquaria kept in homes by hobbyists can be as small as 11 litres (3 [[gallon|gal]]); this size is widely considered the smallest practical system with filtration and other basic systems. On the other hand, reef aquaria under 100&nbsp;litres (20&nbsp;gal) earn a special place in the aquarium hobby; these aquaria, termed [[nano reef]]s, are known to be more difficult due to their small water volume. Practical limitations, most notably the [[weight]] (One litre of fresh water weighs 1&nbsp;kilogram (8.3&nbsp;lb gal<sup>-1</sup>), and salt water is even denser) and internal [[fluid pressure|water pressure]] (requiring thick, strong glass siding) of a large aquarium, keep most home aquaria to a maximum of around 1 cubic metre in volume (1000&nbsp;kg or 2200&nbsp;lb). Indeed, larger aquariums can even threaten the floor beneath the aquarium.<ref name=Sanford2/> Some dedicated aquarists, however, have been known to construct custom aquaria of up to many thousands of litres, at great effort and expense.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.cichlid-forum.com/articles/diy_1700g_tank_1.php|title = Building a 1700 gallon Shark Tank|publisher = cichlid-forum.com | publisher=Cichlid-Forum.com|last=Salvatori|first=Joe|accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monsterfishkeepers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=8952|title=Building My 50,000 Gallon Monster Mega Tank|publisher=MonsterFishKeepers.com|date=[[2005-10-30]]|accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref>
 
Aquaria within [[Public Aquarium|public aquariums]] designed for exhibition of large species or environments can be dramatically larger than any home aquarium. The [[Shedd Aquarium]], for example, features an individual aquarium of 7.7 million litres (2 million gallons).

==Components==
[[Image:Aquarium.png|thumb|Filtration system in a typical aquarium: (1) Intake. (2) Mechanical filtration. (3) Chemical filtration. (4) Biological filtration medium. (5) Outflow to tank.]]

The typical hobbyist aquarium includes a filtration system, an artificial lighting system, and a heater or chiller depending on the inhabitants of the aquarium. Many aquaria incorporate a ''hood'', which prevent evaporation and protect fish from leaving the aquarium (or anything else from entering the aquarium). They also often hold lights.<ref name=Sanford2/> Hoods can be opened and closed easily for access into the aquarium.

Combined biological and mechanical aquarium [[Filter (aquarium)|filtration systems]] are commonly used; these are designed to remove potentially dangerous build up of nitrogenous wastes and [[phosphate]]s dissolved in the water, as well as particulate matter. Filtration systems are often the most complex component of home aquaria, and various designs and combinations are used.<ref name=dakin>{{cite book|title=The Macmillan book of the Marine Aquarium|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan Publishing Company]]|location=New York|last=Dakin|first=Nick|year=1992|ISBN = 0-02-897108-6}}</ref>

[[Heater (aquarium)|Aquarium heater]]s combine a heating element with a [[thermostat]], allowing an aquarist to regulate water temperature at a level above that of the surrounding air, whereas coolers and chillers (refrigeration devices) are for use in cold water aquaria, or anywhere the ambient room temperature is above the desired tank temperature.<ref name=Sanford2/> A variety of different [[thermometer]]s are used, such as the glass alcohol thermometers, adhesive external plastic strip thermometers, and even battery-powered LCD thermometers.<ref name=Sanford2/> In addition, some aquarists use air pumps attached to [[airstone]]s or water pumps to increase water circulation and supply adequate gas exchange at the water surface. Wave-making devices have also been constructed to provide wave action.<ref name=Adey/> 

An aquarium's physical characteristics form another aspect of aquarium design. Size, lighting conditions, density of floating and rooted plants, placement of [[bogwood]], creation of caves or overhangs, type of [[substrate (aquarium)|substrate]], and other factors (including an aquarium's positioning within a room) can all affect the behavior and survival of tank inhabitants. The combined function of these elements is to maintain appropriate water quality and characteristics suitable for the aquarium's residents.

An aquarium is often also placed on a specially-made aquarium ''stand''. Because of the weight of an aquarium, they must be strong as well as level. A tank that is not level may distort, leak, or crack.<ref name=Sanford2/> These are often built like cabinets to allow storage, available in many styles so it can match room [[decor]]. Simple metal tank stands are also available.<ref name=Sanford2/> Some sources say that polystyrene should be placed under the aquarium as a safety precaution.<ref name=Sanford2/> However, this may void certain warranties.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

==Aquarium classifications==
[[Image:58g aquascape.jpg|thumb|A planted freshwater aquarium.]]
From the outdoor ponds and glass jars of antiquity, modern aquaria have evolved into a wide range of specialized systems. Individual aquaria can vary in size from a small bowl large enough for a single small fish, to the huge public aquaria that can simulate entire marine [[ecosystem]]s. A variety of different aquarium types exist; for the most part, many of these classifications are based on the environment the aquarium intends to mimic.

One of the most basic ways to classify aquaria is their salinity. [[Freshwater aquarium|Freshwater aquaria]] are the most popular kind of aquarium due to their lower cost and ease of maintenance.<ref name=Sanford3>{{cite book | title = Aquarium Owner's Guide | last = Sanford | first = Gina | publisher = [[DK Publishing]] | location = New York | date = 1999 | pages = 180-199 | isbn = 0-7894-4614-6}}</ref> [[Marine aquarium|Marine aquaria]] are generally more difficult to setup and maintain than freshwater aquaria. Along with fish species, marine aquaria frequently feature a diverse range of [[invertebrates]].<ref name=Sanford3/><ref name=dakin/> [[Brackish water aquarium|Brackish water aquaria]] combine elements of both marine and freshwater fishkeeping.<ref name=Sanford3/> Fish kept in brackish water aquaria generally come from habitats with varying salinity, such as [[mangroves]] and [[estuaries]]. Certain subtypes of aquaria also exist within these types, such as the [[reef aquarium]], a type of marine aquarium that houses [[coral]].<ref name=Sanford3/>

Another method to classify aquaria is their temperature range. Most aquarists maintain a [[tropical fish|tropical aquarium]] as these fish tend to be more colorful.<ref name=Sanford3/> However, the [[coldwater fish|coldwater aquarium]] is also popular, which often includes fish such as [[goldfish]].<ref name=Sanford3/>
[[Image:Aquarium fg01.jpg|thumb|A saltwater aquarium.]]
Aquaria may be grouped by their species selection. The [[community tank]] is the most common type of aquarium kept today, where several non-aggressive species are housed peacefully together. Aggressive tanks, in contrast, house a limited number of species that can be aggressive toward other fish, or are able to withstand aggression well. Species or specimen tanks usually only house one fish species, along with plants, perhaps found in the fishes' natural environment and decorations simulating a true ecosystem. This type is useful for fish that simply cannot be housed safely with other fish, such as the [[electric eel]], as an extreme example. Some tanks of this sort are used simply to house adults for breeding. In these aquaria, the aquarium fish, [[invertebrate]]s, and [[aquatic plant|plants]] may or may not originate from the same geographic region, but generally tolerate similar water conditions. 

Ecotype, ecotope, or [[biotope]] aquaria is another type based on species selection. In it, an aquarist attempts to simulate a specific ecosystem found in the natural world, bringing together fish, invertebrate species, and plants found only in that ecosystem in a tank with water conditions and decorations designed to simulate their natural environment. These ecotype aquaria might be considered the most sophisticated hobby aquaria; indeed, reputable public aquaria all use this approach in their exhibits whenever possible. This approach best simulates the experience of observing an aquarium's inhabitants in the wild, and also usually serves as the healthiest possible artificial environment for the tank's occupants.

==Public aquaria==
[[Image:Georgia Aquarium - Ocean Voyager Tunnel Jan 2006.jpg|thumb|right|One of the large aquaria at the [[Georgia Aquarium]], USA.]]

{{Main|Public aquarium}}
Public aquariums are facilities open to the public for viewing of aquatic species in aquaria. Most public aquariums feature a number of smaller aquaria, as well those greater in size than could be kept by home aquarists. The largest tanks hold millions of U.S. gallons of water and can house large species, including [[shark]]s or [[beluga]] whales. [[Dolphinarium]]s are aquaria specifically for housing dolphins. Aquatic and semiaquatic animals, including [[otter]]s and [[penguin]]s, may also be kept by public aquariums. Public aquariums may also be included in larger establishments such as a [[marine mammal park]] or a [[marine park]].

Further unreferenced material:
From the 1850s, when the predecessor of the modern aquarium was first developed as a [[Novelties|novelty]], the ranks of aquarists have swelled as more sophisticated systems including lighting and filtration systems were developed to keep aquarium fish healthy. Public aquaria reproduce the home aquarist's hobby on a grand scale — the Georgia Aquarium, the largest aquarium in the world, has 8 million gallons of water and over 100,000 animals.  A wide variety of aquaria are now kept by hobbyists, ranging from a simple bowl housing a single fish to complex simulated [[ecosystem]]s, known as biotype aquariums, with carefully engineered support systems. Aquaria can contain [[fresh water]], [[brine|salt water]] or [[brackish water]], at either tropical or cold water [[temperature]]s. These characteristics, and others, determine the type of fish and other inhabitants that can be maintained in the aquarium. Some inhabitants for aquaria are often collected from the wild, though most frequently aquarium [[organism]]s are bred in captivity to supply the aquarium trade.
