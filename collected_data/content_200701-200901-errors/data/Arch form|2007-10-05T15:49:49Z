In [[music]], '''arch form''' is a [[section_(music)|section]]al [[musical form|structure]] for a piece of music based on [[repetition]], in reverse order, of all or most musical sections such that the overall form is [[symmetric]], most often around a central movement. The sections need not be repeated verbatim but must at least share [[Theme (music)|thematic]] material.

It creates interest through interplay among "memory, variation, and progression." Though the form appears to be static and to deny progress, the pairs of movements create a "unidirectional process" with the center, and the form "actually engenders specific expressive possibilities that would otherwise be unavailable for the work as a whole." (Wilson 1992, p.32)

[[Béla Bartók]] is noted for his use of arch form, e.g., in his Fourth and Fifth quartets, ''Second Piano Concerto'', and, less so, ''Second Violin Concerto'' (ibid). [[Samuel Barber]]'s [[Adagio for Strings]] also uses arch form.
