A '''dragonfly''' is an [[insect]] belonging to the order [[Odonata]], the suborder [[Epiprocta]] or, in the strict sense, the infraorder '''Anisoptera'''. It is characterized by large [[compound eye|multifaceted eyes]], two pairs of strong transparent [[insect wing|wings]], and an elongated body.

Dragonflies typically eat [[mosquito]]es, [[midges]] and other small insects like [[fly|flies]], [[bee]]s, and [[butterfly|butterflies]]. They are usually found around lakes, ponds, streams, and [[wetland]]s because their [[larva]]e, known as "[[nymph (biology)|nymphs]]", are aquatic. Dragonflies do not normally bite or sting humans (though they will bite in order to escape, for example, if grasped by the abdomen); in fact, they are valued as a [[predation|predator]] that helps control the populations of harmful insects, such as mosquitoes. It is because of this that dragonflies are sometimes called "mosquito hawks" in North America along with the [[Crane Fly]]{{Fact|date=May 2007}} (which, in fact, does not eat mosquitoes).

==Life cycle==
[[Image:Dragonfly morphology edit 3.svg|left|thumb|200px|<center>External morphology of a dragonfly</center>]]

Female dragonflies lay [[egg (biology)|eggs]] in or near water, often in or on floating or emergent plants. Most of the life of the dragonfly is spent in the [[larva]]l ([[naiad (biology)|naiad]], aka nymph) form, beneath the water surface, using internal [[gill]]s to breathe, and catching other [[invertebrate]]s or even vertebrates such as [[tadpole]]s and [[fish]]. In the adult (flying) stage, larger species of dragonfly can live as long as four months.

==General facts==

[[Image:IC Gomphidae wing.jpg|thumb|200px|Wing structure of a dragonfly]]
===Record breakers===
Much larger dragonfly species existed in the distant past than occur on earth today. The largest one, found as a [[fossil]], is an extinct [[Protodonata]] named ''[[Meganeura]] monyi'' from the [[Permian]] period with a [[wingspan]] of 70&ndash;75&nbsp;cm (27.5&ndash;29.5&nbsp;in). This compares to 19&nbsp;cm (7.5&nbsp;in) for the largest modern species of odonates, the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian]] endemic dragonfly, ''[[Anax strenuus]]''. The smallest modern species recorded is the libellulid dragonfly, ''[[Nannophya pygmaea]]'' from [[East Asia]] with a wingspan of only 20&nbsp;mm, or about Â¾ of an inch.

Dragonflies are the world's fastest insects and, although estimates of their speed vary wildly, most credible authorities say they are capable of reaching speeds of between 30 and 60 [[kilometres per hour|km/h]] (19 to 38 [[miles per hour|mph]]).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://dragonflywebsite.com/faq.htm|accessdate=January 21|accessyear=2007|title=Dragonflies}}</ref> A study showed that dragonflies can travel as much as 137 km (85 mi) in one day.<ref>BBC. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4759615.stm "Tiny tags trace dragonfly paths"], [[10 May]] [[2006]]</ref>

===Vision===
Dragonflies have excellent eyesight due to their eye structure. Their [[compound eye]]s have up to 30,000 facets, each of which is a separate light-sensing organ or [[ommatidia|ommatidium]], arranged to give nearly a 360&deg; [[field of vision]].

===Camouflage===
It was recently discovered that dragonflies employ a particular [[optical illusion]], termed ''[[motion camouflage]]''<ref>{{cite web| url=http://info.anu.edu.au/MAC/Media/Media_Releases/_2003/_030605Dragonflies.asp|accessdate=June 18|accessyear=2006|title=Dragonflies prove clever predators}}</ref>, to stalk other insects that invade their territory. The research suggests that a dragonfly can move in such a way as to project itself as a stationary object while speedily attacking its victims. These findings illustrate for the first time how dragonflies use complex [[camouflage|camouflaging]] techniques during aerial combat.

==Classification==
===Ancient dragonflies ("Anisozygoptera")===
Conventionally, the Anisoptera were given suborder rank beside the ''ancient dragonflies'' ("Anisozygoptera", two living species and numerous fossil ones), but it has been determined recently that the Anisozygoptera form a [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] assemblage of primitive relatives of the Anisoptera. Thus, the Anisoptera are reduced to an [[infraorder]], forming the new suborder Epiprocta (dragonflies in a general sense). The artificial grouping Anisozygoptera is disbanded, its members being recognized as largely extinct offshoots at various stages of dragonfly [[evolution]].

The oldest known species dragonfly is the 320 million year old ''[[Delitzschala bitterfeldensis]]''. Another old genus is ''[[Namurotypus]]''.

===Dragonflies vs. damselflies===
[[Damselfly|Damselflies]] (Suborder Zygoptera) are often confused with dragonflies, but the two insects are distinct: most damselflies at rest hold their wings together above the body or held slightly open above (such as in the family Lestidae), whereas dragonflies at rest hold their wings horizontally or occasionally slightly down and forward. Also, the hindwing of the dragonfly broadens near the base, caudal to the connecting point at the body, while the hindwing of the damselfly is essentially similar to the forewing. The eyes on a damselfly are separated; in most dragonflies the eyes touch, with notable exceptions to this being in the Petaluridae (Petaltails) and the Gomphidae (Clubtails). Both are members of the Odonata, making their life cycles similar.

==Dragonflies in culture==
In Europe, dragonflies have often been viewed as sinister.  Some English vernacular names, such as "[[devil]]'s needle" and "ear cutter", link them with evil or injury.<ref name="Corbet-559">

"troll's spindle") as well as sending them to poke out the eyes of their enemies.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} The [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] name for dragonflies is "Ãyenstikker", which literally means Eye Poker. They are often associated with [[snake]]s, as in the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name ''gwas-y-neidr'', "[[adder]]'s servant".<ref name="Corbet-559"/>  The [[Southern United States]] term "snake doctor" refers to a folk belief that dragonflies follow snakes around and stitch them back together if they are injured.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Hand | first = Wayland D. | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = From Idea to Word: Folk Beliefs and Customs Underlying Folk Speech | journal = American Speech | volume = 48 | issue = 1/2 | pages = 67-76 | publisher =  | date = 1973 | url = http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-1283(197321%2F22)48%3A1%2F2%3C67%3AFITWFB%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Y | doi =  | id = | accessdate = 2007-02-15 }}</ref> . The Lithuanian word "[[:lt:LaumÄ|Laum]][[:lt:Å½irgas|Å¾irgis]]" is a composite word meaning "the [[Lauma]]'s horse".

In East Asia and among Native Americans, dragonflies have a far better reputation, one that can also be said to have positively influenced modern day views about dragonflies in most countries.

For some Native American tribes they represent swiftness and activity, and for the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] they symbolize pure water.  Dragonflies are a common motif in [[Zuni]] pottery; stylized as a double-barred cross, they appear in [[Hopi]] rock art and on [[Pueblo people|Pueblo]] necklaces.<ref name="Mitchell-20">Mitchell and Lasswell, 20-26.</ref>  It is said in some Native American beliefs that dragonflies are a symbol of renewal after a time of great hardship.

In [[Japan]] dragonflies are symbols of courage, strength, and happiness, and they often appear in art and literature, especially [[haiku]].  In ancient mythology, Japan was known as ''Akitsushima'', which means "Land of the Dragonflies". The love for dragonflies is reflected by the fact that there are traditional names for almost all of the 200 species of dragonflies found in and around Japan. <ref>{{cite book | last = Waldbauer | first = Gilbert | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Handy Bug Answer Book| publisher = Visible Ink Press | date = 1998 | location = Detroit | page = 91 | id = ISBN 1-57859-049-3 }} </ref>  Japanese children catch large dragonflies as a game, using a hair with a small pebble tied to each end, which they throw into the air.  The dragonfly mistakes the pebbles for prey, gets tangled in the hair, and is dragged to the ground by the weight.<ref name="Mitchell-38">Mitchell and Lasswell, 38.</ref>

They also have traditional uses as medicine in Japan and China. In some parts of the world they are a food source, eaten either as adults or larvae; in [[Indonesia]], for example, they are caught on poles made sticky with [[birdlime]], then fried in oil as a [[delicacy]].<ref name="Corbet-559"/>  

Images of dragonflies were common in [[Art Nouveau]], especially in jewelry designs.<ref>{{cite news | last = Moonan | first = Wendy | coauthors = | title = Dragonflies Shimmering as Jewelry | work = New York Times | pages = E2:38 | date = [[August 13]], [[1999]] | ID = ProQuest document ID 43893085}}</ref>  They have also been used as a decorative motif on fabrics and home furnishings.<ref>{{cite news | last = Large | first = Elizabeth | coauthors =  | title = THE LATEST BUZZ; In the world of design, dragonflies are flying high  | work = The Sun (Baltimore, MD) | pages = 6N | date = [[June 27]], [[1999]] | ID = ProQuest document ID 42880564 }}</ref>
