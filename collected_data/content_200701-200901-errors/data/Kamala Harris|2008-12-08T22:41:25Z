'''Kamala Devi Harris''' (born [[October 21]], [[1964]], in [[Oakland, California]]) is the current [[District Attorney]] of [[San Francisco]]. She is the first female District Attorney to be elected in San Francisco, the first [[African American]] elected as District Attorney in [[California]], and the first [[Indian American]] elected to the position in the [[United States]]. She was elected in December 2003 with over 56 percent of the votes in a run-off election against the two-term incumbent, [[Terence Hallinan]]. She was also cited by the ''[[New York Times]]'' to be among the seventeen most likely women to become the first female [[President of the United States]].<ref name="Zernike2008">{{cite news |first=Kate |last=Zernike |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=She Just Might Be President Someday |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/weekinreview/18zernike.html |work=New York Times |publisher= |date=2008-05-18 |accessdate= }}</ref>

Harris attended the historically African American college, [[Howard University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and received a [[Juris Doctor]] [[(J.D.)]] from [[University of California, Hastings College of the Law]] in 1989.  She is the daughter of an [[Indian American]] mother, Dr. Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer specialist, who emigrated to the United States in 1960, and a [[Jamaican American]] father, [[Stanford University]] economics professor Donald Harris. 

Harris served as Deputy District Attorney in [[Alameda County]], [[California]] from 1990 to 1998. She then became Managing Attorney of the Career Criminal Unit in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office.  In 2000, San Francisco City Attorney [[Louise Renne]] recruited her to join the her office, where she was Chief of the Community and Neighborhood Division, which oversees civil [[code enforcement]] matters.  

In 2004, The [[National Urban League]] honored Harris as a "Woman of Power" and she received the Thurgood Marshall Award from the National Black Prosecutors Association in 2005.  The [[Los Angeles Daily Journal]] recognized Harris as one of the top 100 lawyers in California. Additionally, she has served on the boards of several community organizations.

In April 2004, when police officer Isaac Espinoza was gunned down in the Bayview district, Harris announced that she would not seek the death penalty for the man accused of his killing, a decision which triggered protests from police officers and many citizens.  Some were supportive of the decision in a community where [[capital punishment]] is opposed.  Harris had made a campaign promise that she would not seek the death penalty if elected.  Attorney General [[Bill Lockyer]] even threatened to intervene on behalf of the State of California to take the case out of Harris' jurisdiction.  In the end, he ruled that Harris had acted within her legal authority.<ref>[http://www.sfweekly.com/2003-09-24/news/kamala-s-karma/ Kamala's Karma]</ref>  In June 2008, the issue of capital punishment arose again when Danielle Bologna, whose husband and two sons were murdered by illegal immigrants that were also gang members, were protected by the city's sanctuary policy, demanded that Harris consider the death penalty for her family's killer. The suspect in the murder had been arrested just one month earlier on gun charges, but Harris' office declined to press charges in that earlier case. Harris has been widely criticized for not taking proactive approach in prosectuing illegal immigrants and criminals over the citizens of San Francisco.<ref>See http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/07/22/EDLT11SJQU.DTL&hw=kamala+harris+bologna&sn=004&sc=434.</ref>

In addition to this Harris' office is investigating itself for accepting $5.4M grant money from the federal government for assistance in prosecuting border crimes that her office never prosecuted after accepting federal funds. In April 2008, Harris' response was, "I am in the process of determining exactly what our understanding was about the rules for which prosecuted cases were ... eligible for reimbursement. I hope I will have some information in the next couple weeks." Asked if her office would return any money to which it was not entitled, the district attorney said, "We are working together with both local and federal agencies to do the right thing."<ref>See

Harris ran unopposed for re-election in 2007. She has received acclaim from some for increasing conviction rates over previous DA, Terrence Hallinan (whose conviction rate was 52% versus the 83% state-wide average) and the overall professionalism of the office, but has been criticized for selectively prosecuting cases to bolster the conviction rate, which now stands at about 67%. Harris has also faced criticism in the face of continuing poor relations with police and rising violent crime rates. <ref>[http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/03/20/MNG01HQVPA1.DTL Trials and tribulations of Kamala Harris, D.A.]</ref>

Harris's office prosecuted Eric Hunt for an assault on [[Elie Wiesel]], based on the latter's notoriety as an author of [[Holocaust]]-related literature. She commented, "Crimes motivated by hate are among the most reprehensible of offenses....This defendant has been made to answer for an unwarranted and biased attack on a man who has dedicated his life to peace."<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/07/21/BA5C11SNGT.DTL&tsp=1 sfgate.com, SF jury convicts man of 1 felony in Wiesel case]</ref>

Harris is a candidate for [[Attorney General of California]] in 2010.
