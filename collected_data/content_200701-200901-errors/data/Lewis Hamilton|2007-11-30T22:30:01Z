'''Lewis Carl Hamilton''' (born [[January 7]], [[1985]] in [[Stevenage]], [[Hertfordshire]]) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Formula One]] (F1) racing driver, currently racing for the [[McLaren]] team. 

He finished second in the [[2007 Formula One Season|2007 Formula One Championship]], behind [[Kimi Räikkönen]]. Hamilton has set numerous F1 rookie records and is the first [[Black people|black]] driver to compete in Formula One.<ref>{{cite news

Retrieved 2 November 2007</ref> he approached McLaren team principal, [[Ron Dennis]] at an awards ceremony and told him he would drive for McLaren one day; three years later, Hamilton was signed by McLaren and Mercedes-Benz to their Young Driver Support Programme, and ultimately, 12 years after this initial encounter, made his Formula One debut with the McLaren team. He has stated that he wants to stay in the McLaren team for the rest of his F1 career.
==Personal and early life==
Hamilton's [[paternal]] grandparents imigrated to the [[United Kingdom]] from [[Grenada]] in the 1950s. His grandfather worked on the [[London Underground]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Grenadian roots of first black F1 driver |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2006/11/061127_grenadaf1.shtml |date=[[2006-11-27]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=2006-12-12}}</ref> His mother Carmen and father Anthony named him after the US [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medal winning athlete [[Carl Lewis]].<ref>Sourced from [[ITV]]'s 2007 Bahrain Grand Prix commentary</ref> Hamilton's parents separated when he was two and, until he was ten, he lived with his mother and half-sisters Nicola and Samantha.<ref>{{cite news |title=MY BOY RACER| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20070701/ai_n19341883 |date=[[2007-07-01]] |publisher=[[Daily Mirror]] |accessdate=2007-07-01}}</ref> After that he lived with his father, step-mother Linda and half-brother Nicholas who has [[cerebral palsy]].

Hamilton's first taste of racing competition came at the controls of [[radio-controlled car]]s. Father Anthony bought him one in 1991, and Hamilton finished second in the national championship the following year. Hamilton said of the time: "I was racing these remote-controlled cars and winning club championships against adults".<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio"> {{cite web | title = Who's Who: Lewis Hamilton | publisher = F1Fanatic.co.uk | date = 2007 | url = http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/f1-information/whos-who/whos-who-h/lewis-hamilton/ | accessdate =2007-10-06}}</ref> That led to Hamilton sampling kart racing for the first time. Aged six, his father bought him his first [[go-kart]] as a Christmas present,<ref name=nutsref>20 things you don't know about Lewis Hamilton, [[Nuts (magazine)]], 22-28 June 2007</ref> and would support his racing career as long as he worked hard at school. When supporting his son became problematic Anthony Hamilton took redundancy as an IT Manager and became a contractor - sometimes doing up to three jobs at a time to support his son's career - and still found enough time to attend all his races. He would later set up his own computer company, as well as working as a manager for Hamilton on a full time basis.<ref name=observer>{{cite news|last=Owen|first=Oliver|title=The real deal|publisher=[[The Observer|Observer Sport Monthly]]|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,329945795-103977,00.html

Hamilton attended [[The John Henry Newman School]] in Stevenage.<ref name=zooref>[[Zoo (magazine)]]: Issue 162, 30 March-4 April 2007</ref> He took up [[karate]] at an early age when his driving attracted the attention of local bullies. By the time he was twelve, he had gained his first [[black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in the sport. He extended his skills to football, playing in his school team alongside current [[Aston Villa]] and England International midfielder [[Ashley Young]].<ref name=observer />

On October 29, 2007, Hamilton announced his intent to live in [[Switzerland]], to get away from the media scrutiny he has experienced living in the United Kingdom. Hamilton mentioned on the television show ''Parkinson'' (broadcast on 10th November 2007), that taxation was 'partly' responsible for his decision, in addition to wanting more privacy.<ref name=BBC>{{cite news|last=News|first=BBC|title=Hamilton makes tax move admission]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/7088652.stm

==Career==
===Karting===
Hamilton began [[kart racing|karting]] in 1993 at the age of eight,<ref name="BBC_07-06-19">{{cite news

At age ten, he approached McLaren F1 team boss Ron Dennis for an autograph, and told him, "Hi. I'm Lewis Hamilton. I won the British Championship and one day I want to be racing your cars." Dennis wrote in his autograph book, "Phone me in nine years, we'll sort something out then."<ref name=hamiltonf1fbio />

From the Cadet ranks (1993-7), he progressed through the Junior Yamaha (1998) and Junior Intercontinental A (1999) divisions. In 1998 Dennis delivered on his promise and signed Hamilton to the McLaren driver development program. This contract included an option of a future F1 seat, making Hamilton the youngest ever driver to secure a contract which later resulted in an F1 drive.<ref name="BBC_07-06-19" />

Lewis Hamilton continued his progress in the Intercontinental A (1999), Formula A (2000) and Formula Super A (2001) ranks, and became European Champion in 2000 with maximum points. In [[Formula A]] and [[Formula Super A]], racing for TeamMBM.com, his team mate was [[Nico Rosberg]], who would later drive for the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] team in Formula One. Following his karting successes, the [[British Racing Drivers' Club]] made him a ‘Rising Star’ Member in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mclaren.com/theteam/lewis_hamilton_biography.php|title=Lewis Hamilton Biography|publisher=Vodafone McLaren Mercedes official website|accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref>

In 2001 [[Michael Schumacher]] made a one-off return to karts and competed against Hamilton along with other future F1 drivers [[Vitantonio Liuzzi]] and Nico Rosberg. Hamilton ended the final seventh, four places behind Schumacher, and although the two saw little of each other on the track Schumacher praised the young Briton (see quote box).<ref name="hamiltonschumacherf1f"> {{cite web | title = When Hamilton raced Schumacher | publisher = F1Fanatic.co.uk | date = 2007 | url = http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2007/09/18/when-hamilton-raced-schumacher/ | accessdate =2007-06-10}}</ref>

===Formula Renault and Formula Three===

Hamilton began his car racing career in the 2001 British Formula Renault Winter Series. Despite crashing on his third lap in the car in testing, he finished fifth overall in the winter series.<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio"> This led to a full 2002 [[British Formula Renault Championship|Formula Renault UK]] campaign with Manor Motorsport. Hamilton finished third overall with three wins and three pole positions. He remained with Manor for another year and won the championship with ten wins and 419 points to the two wins and 377 points of this nearest rival, [[Alex Lloyd (racing driver)|Alex Lloyd]]. Having clinched the championship, Hamilton missed the last two races of the season to make his debut in the season finale of the [[British Formula Three Championship]]. Here he was less successful: in the first race he was forced out with a puncture,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=138456&FS=BF3

Hamilton and Manor then made their début in the [[2004]] [[Formula Three Euroseries]]. They won one race and Hamilton ended the year fifth in the championship. He also won the Bahrain F3 Superprix and raced one of the [[Macau Grand Prix|Macau F3 Grand Prix]]. Hamilton first tested for [[McLaren]] in late 2004, at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.crash.net/news_view~cid~1~id~103712~pid~1.htm

He moved to reigning Euroseries champions ASM for the 2005 season and dominated the championship, winning 15 of the 20 rounds after being disqualified from one win at [[Spa-Francorchamps]] on a technical infringement that caught out several other drivers.<ref name=hamiltonf1fbio> He also won the [[Ultimate Masters of Formula 3|Marlboro Masters of Formula 3]] at [[Circuit Park Zandvoort|Zandvoort]].<ref>{{cite news

===GP2===

After the season, British magazine ''[[Autosport]]'' featured him in their “Top 50 Drivers of 2005” issue, ranking Hamilton 24th. After his success in Formula Three, he moved to ASM's sister GP2 team [[ART Grand Prix]] for [[2006 GP2 Series season|2006]]. Just like their sister team in F3, ART were the class of the field and reigning champions having taken the 2005 GP2 crown with [[Nico Rosberg]]. Hamilton won the GP2 championship at his first attempt, beating [[Nelson Angelo Piquet|Nelson Piquet Junior]].
[[Image:Luis Hamilton Sepang.jpg|thumb|Hamilton securing second place in Malaysia.]]
His notable performances included a dominant win at the [[Nürburgring]], despite serving a penalty for speeding in the [[pit stop|pit lane]]. At his home race at [[Silverstone]], supporting the [[British Grand Prix]], Hamilton impressed by overtaking two rivals at Becketts, a series of high-speed (up to 150&nbsp;mph in a GP2 car) bends where overtaking is rare. He demonstrated his overtaking prowess again in Istanbul, when he recovered from a spin that left him 18th to take second place in the final corners. He won the title in unusual circumstances, inheriting the final point he needed after [[Giorgio Pantano]] was stripped of fastest lap in the [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] feature race.<ref>{{cite web

His 2006 GP2 championship coincided with a vacancy at McLaren following the departure of [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] to [[NASCAR]] and [[Kimi Räikkönen]] to [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]].<ref>{{cite news

After months of speculation on whether Hamilton, [[Pedro de la Rosa]], [[Gary Paffett]] or former World Champion [[Mika Häkkinen]] would be paired with defending champion [[Fernando Alonso]] in [[2007 Formula One season|2007]], Hamilton was confirmed as the team's second driver.<ref>{{cite news| title = Lewis Hamilton joins Formula 1 World Champion Fernando Alonso at Vodafone McLaren Mercedes| publisher = mclaren.com| url = http://www.mclaren.com/mediaroom/information/pressreleases/lewis_hamilton.php| date = [[2006-11-24]]| accessdate = 2006-11-24}}</ref> He was told of McLaren’s decision on [[September 30]], but the news was not made public until [[November 24]], for fear that it would be overshadowed by [[Michael Schumacher]]’s retirement announcement.<ref name="Tremayne">{{cite news |url=http://sport.independent.co.uk/motor_racing/article2013302.ece |title= Hamilton's F1 drive is a dream come true |author=David Tremayne |date=[[2006-11-25]] |accessdate=2006-11-25 |publisher=[[The Independent]]}}</ref>

Hamilton finished second behind Alonso at [[2007 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] and afterwards suggested he was prevented from racing his team mate. But the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] cleared McLaren following an investigation (see below).

Hamilton scored the first [[pole position]] and victory of his F1 career in the [[2007 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]] at [[Montreal]]. He led most of the race despite the [[safety car]] being deployed four times. The win strengthened his championship challenge.<ref>{{cite news| title =Canadian Grand Prix | publisher =BBC Sport| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/6739373.stm| date =[[2007-06-10]]| accessdate =2007-06-11}}</ref> A week later, Hamilton won the [[2007 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]] also from pole position, becoming the first Briton since [[John Watson (racing driver)|John Watson]] in [[1983 United States Grand Prix West|1983]] to win an F1 race in the US,<ref name="usgpfactsstats"> {{cite web | title = United States Grand Prix facts and statistics | publisher = F1Fanatic.co.uk | date = 2007 | url = http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2007/06/18/united-states-grand-prix-facts-statistics/ | accessdate =2007-10-06}}</ref> and only the second person, after [[Jacques Villeneuve]], to win more than one race in his rookie F1 season since the first year of the Championship. 

By finishing third at [[2007 French Grand Prix|Magny-Cours]] behind [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] drivers [[Kimi Räikkönen]] and Felipe Massa, Hamilton extended his lead in the Driver's Championship to 14 points. This was the first time in his F1 career he finished a race in a lower position than he started, and the first time he had been passed on the racetrack in Formula One. He took pole at his home Grand Prix at [[2007 British Grand Prix|Silverstone]] and led the first 16 laps, but slipped to third, 40 seconds behind Räikkönen and Alonso.

During qualifying for the [[2007 European Grand Prix|European Grand Prix]], Hamilton crashed at the [[Nürburgring#1984: The new Grand Prix track|Schumacher chicane]] after a problem with the [[Lug nut|wheel nut]] air gun used on his car.

However as he kept his engine running he was lifted back on to the circuit and able rejoin the race after the restart. His ninth place finish in this race was his first non-podium and non-points finish, enabling title contenders Alonso and Massa to reduce Hamilton's championship lead.

Hamilton won the [[2007 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungarian Grand Prix]] from pole position following a controversy in qualifying. Alonso had set the fastest time, but was relegated to fifth on the grid for preventing Hamilton from leaving the pit lane in time to complete his final qualifying lap. [[Kimi Räikkönen]] stayed within five seconds of Hamilton for the entire race (excluding pit stop periods). McLaren were docked any constructor's points earned during the race due to the incident in qualifying.

[[Image:Lewis Hamilton 2007 Belgium 2 (crop).JPG|thumb|Hamilton took fourth place in [[2007 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]].]]
Alonso beat Hamilton in the [[2007 Italian Grand Prix|Italian]] and [[2007 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian]] Grands Prix, leaving the Briton with a two-point lead in the title race. However he extended his lead to 12 points after winning the [[2007 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]] in heavy rain, after Alonso crashed. Following the race Hamilton was investigated by the race stewards over his involvement in an incident behind the safety car, which saw both [[Sebastian Vettel]] and [[Mark Webber]] crash out of the race while following the McLaren. The trio were cleared on the Friday of the [[2007 Chinese Grand Prix|Chinese Grand Prix]] weekend.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.forumula1.net/2007/f1/f1-news/no-penalty-for-hamilton-vettel-penalty-annulled/ |title= No Penalty for Hamilton; Vettel Penalty Annulled |publisher = [http://www.forumula1.net Forumula1.net]|date= [[October 5th]], [[2007]]|accessdate= 2007-10-05}}</ref> 

After securing pole position in [[2007 Chinese Grand Prix|China]], Hamilton retired from the race which saw changeable weather conditions. He experienced considerable tyre wear, notably his right rear, and he ran wide into the gravel trap in the pitlane, where his car beached. This was Hamilton's first retirement of his Formula One career. It was later revealed that [[Bridgestone]] became unnerved at the glaringly worn tyres and advised McLaren to order him to make a [[pit stop]] which McLaren refused to do, believing it would be counterproductive. Hamilton thus went into the final race of the season four and seven points ahead of Alonso and Räikkönen respectively.

Although starting in 2nd place, in the [[2007 Brazilian Grand Prix]] he failed to finish in a championship-winning position, finishing the race in 7th overall after being in 18th place at his worst point of the race. This occurred due to two major incidents; first, he was passed by Räikkönen away from the line, before being boxed in by Massa and Räikkönen in the first corner and passed by Alonso at Turn 3.<ref>{{cite news| title =Ferrari move up a gear to hand Räikkönen glory| publisher =the guardian| url =http://sport.guardian.co.uk/motorsport/story/0,,2196424,00.html| date =[[2007-07-22]]| accessdate =2007-07-22}}</ref> Hamilton attempted to re-pass Alonso in turn four, but ran wide, dropping four places to eighth.

On lap 9, Hamilton encountered a gearbox problem, which meant that he was stuck in neutral and could not select any gears.<ref>{{cite news

The gearbox became operational again after Hamilton switched settings on his steering wheel, but he lost 40 seconds while his car was coasting. For most of the race, Massa was leading the race with Räikkönen in second. If this was the case come the [[Racing flag#The checkered flag|chequered flag]] and with Hamilton in 7th place, this would have meant that Hamilton would become world champion, but after their second round of pit stops, Räikkönen stayed out a couple of laps longer than Massa and took the lead.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=41156 |title=Massa happy to help Kimi to title |publisher = [http://www.itv-f1.com itv f1]|date= [[October 23]], [[2007]]|accessdate= 2007-10-23}}</ref> Once in front, Räikkönen made no mistakes in the remaining laps to win the race and become Formula One world champion. 

Later on [[October 21]], it was announced that the [[FIA]] were investigating [[BMW Sauber]] and [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] for fuel irregularities, the BMW drivers finished 5th and 6th, if they were to be excluded Hamilton would be promoted to 5th and would win the 2007 Drivers World Championship by one point over Räikkönen. A precedent had been set in 1995, Michael Schumacher, then of Benetton-Renault, and [[David Coulthard]], then of Williams-Renault, were both found guilty of possessing illegal fuel in their cars. In that situation both drivers were intially docked drivers points, but for unspecified reasons it would transpire - over a week later - that constructor points would be docked. Ultimately, no penalty whatsoever was given to any team and it was said that there was "sufficient doubt as to render it inappropriate to impose a penalty", though McLaren have officially appealed this decision.<ref name="McLaren appeal">{{cite news

}}{{Rs|date=October 2007}}</ref>

Ahead of the world championship finale, Hamilton answered a question about what it would mean to him as a black driver to become champion, saying: "It will show that not only white people can do it, but also black people, Indians, Japanese and Chinese. It will be good to mean something."<ref name="hamiltonpretitleremarks"> {{cite web | title = Lewis Hamilton fans 'racist' | publisher = F1Fanatic.co.uk | date = 2007 | url = http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2007/10/17/lewis-hamilton-fans-racist/ | accessdate =2007-10-18}}</ref>

Having made few public remarks about his ethnicity since becoming an F1 driver, Hamilton added: "Outside of Formula One my heroes are foremost my father, then Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King. Being black is not a negative. It’s a positive, if anything, because I’m different. In the future it can open doors to different cultures and that is what motor sport is trying to do anyway."<ref name="hamiltonpretitleremarks" />

====Team tensions====
[[Image:Podium 2007 USGP.jpg|thumb|Hamilton on the podium after winning the [[2007 United States Grand Prix]]]]
Hamilton's relationship with McLaren team boss Ron Dennis dates back to 1995.<ref>{{cite web| title = Hamilton 2007 Pre-season interview | url = http://www.sportinglife.com/formula1/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=formula1/07/03/05/AUTO_Formula_One_Hamilton.html| publisher = Sporting Life | date = 2007-08-30| accessdate = 2007-08-30}}</ref> The first indication that Hamilton was unhappy with his team appeared after he finished second at [[2007 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]]. After post-race comments made by Hamilton which suggested he had been forced into a supporting role, the FIA initiated an inquiry to determine whether McLaren had broken rules by enforcing team orders.<ref name="inquiry">{{cite news| title =The FIA’s McLaren-Monaco statement in full | publisher =Formula1.com| url =http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2007/5/6178.html| date =[[2007-05-30]]| accessdate =2007-06-05}}</ref> McLaren denied favouring double world champion [[Fernando Alonso]], and the FIA subsequently vindicated the team, stating that: "McLaren were able to pursue an optimum team strategy because they had a substantial advantage over all other cars. They did nothing which could be described as interfering with the race result."<ref name="inquiry" />

However, rivalry with team mate Alonso led to speculation that one of the pair would leave McLaren at the end of the 2007 season.<ref>{{cite news| title =The future of Fernando Alonso| publisher =grandprix.com| url =http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns19511.html| date =[[2007-08-06]]| accessdate =2007-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title =Alonso cool on future at McLaren| publisher =news.bbc.co.uk| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/motorsport/formula_one/6932307.stm| date =[[2007-08-05]]| accessdate =2007-09-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title =Rumour: Hamilton to Ferrari?| publisher =muchhalasworld.com| url =http://www.muchhalasworld.com/2007/05/31/rumour-hamilton-to-ferrari/| date =[[2007-05-31]]| accessdate =2007-09-13}}</ref>  Alonso and McLaren subsequently terminated their contract by mutual consent on [[November 2]] [[2007]].<ref>{{cite news| title =Alonso secures exit from McLaren| publisher =news.bbc.co.uk| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/7074737.stm| date =[[2007-11-02]]| accessdate =2007-11-02}}</ref>

The tensions within the team surfaced at the [[2007 Hungarian Grand Prix]]. During final qualifying for the race, Hamilton was involved in a controversy that saw McLaren and Alonso penalised after Hamilton was delayed in the pits and thus unable to set a final lap before the end of the session. McLaren pointed out that Hamilton had disobeyed an earlier instruction to let Alonso past in qualifying.<ref>{{cite news| title = Dennis: Hold up is Hamilton's fault| publisher =f1.gpupdate.net| url =http://f1.gpupdate.net/en/news/2007/08/04/dennis-hold-up-is-hamilton-s-fault/| date =[[2007-08-04]]| accessdate =2007-08-05}}</ref> Alonso was relegated to 6th place on the grid, thus elevating Hamilton (who had originally qualified second) to first. Hamilton said he thought Alonso's penalty was "quite light if anything" and only regretted the loss of constructors' points.<ref>{{cite episode|title= Chequered Flag (podcast)| network= BBC| station= BBC Radio Five Live| minutes= 5:56}}</ref> Hamilton was reported to have sworn at Dennis on the team radio following the incident.<ref>{{cite news| title =Hamilton handed pole after Alonso punished| publisher =timesonline.co.uk| url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/formula_1/article2199765.ece| date =[[2007-08-05]]| accessdate =2007-08-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title =LEWIS F-WORD STORM| publisher =sundaymirror.co.uk| url =http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/sport/motorsport/2007/08/05/lewis-f-word-storm-98487-19574046/| date =[[2007-08-05]]| accessdate =2007-08-07}}</ref> British motorsport journal ''[[Autosport]]'' claimed that this "[lead] Dennis to throw his headphones on the pit wall in disgust (a gesture that was misinterpreted by many to be in reaction to Alonso's pole)".<ref>{{cite news| title =Hamilton apologises to McLaren| publisher =autosport.com| url =http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/61385| date =[[2007-08-05]]| accessdate =2007-08-07}}</ref> However McLaren later issued a statement on behalf of Hamilton which denied the use of any profanity.<ref>{{cite news| title = McLaren: Lewis didn't swear at Dennis | url = http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=40329| work = itv-f1.com| publisher = ITV Network | date = 2007-08-09| accessdate = 2007-08-09}}</ref>  As a result of these events, the relationship between Hamilton and Alonso temporarily collapsed, with the pair not on speaking terms for a short period.<ref>{{cite news| title =Hungarian GP - Alonso not speaking to Hamilton| publisher =uk.eurosport.yahoo.com| url =http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/06082007/58/hungarian-gp-alonso-speaking-hamilton.html| date =[[2007-08-06]]| accessdate =2007-08-06}}</ref><ref name="Hamilton calls for truce"/>  In the aftermath it was reported that Hamilton had been targeted by [[Luca di Montezemolo]] regarding a [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] drive for {{F1|2008}}.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cooper |first=Steve |year=2007 |month=August |title=McLaren dream team turns into nightmare |journal=Autosport |volume=189 |issue=6 |pages=pp.6-8 }}</ref>

Following the stewards' investigation into the incident at the [[2007 Japanese Grand Prix]], Alonso insinuated that the verdict had settled the championship in Hamilton's favour, saying: "I’m not thinking of this championship anymore, it’s been decided off the track. The drivers’ briefing has no purpose. You go there to hear what [[Charlie Whiting]] and the other officials say. Twenty one drivers have an opinion, Charlie and the officials another, and so it’s like talking to a wall."<ref name="f1falonsohamiltonattack"> {{cite web | title = Alonso continues attacks on McLaren & Hamilton | publisher = F1Fanatic.co.uk | date = 2007 | url = http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2007/10/06/alonso-continues-attacks-on-mclaren-hamilton/ | accessdate =2007-10-06}}</ref>

During the 2007 European Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, Hamilton became the first driver to have his car recovered by a crane and put back on the track during an F1 race, although several drivers have been pushed back onto the circuit by the marshals without mechanical aids when judged to be in a dangerous position, such as Michael Schumacher during the [[2003 European Grand Prix]].<ref>{{cite news
