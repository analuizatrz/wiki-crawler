'''Mark Garry Hammett''' (born [[13 July]] [[1972]] in [[Christchurch]]) is a [[rugby union]] [[coach (sport)|coach]] and former [[New Zealand]] rugby union player. Hammett played provincial rugby for [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]], as a [[Rugby union positions#2. Hooker|hooker]], between 1992 and 2002. When the [[Crusaders (rugby)|Crusaders]] franchise was formed for the [[Super 12]] in 1996, Hammett was contracted, becoming a founding player. He continued to play for the Crusaders until 2003; winning four championships in the process. He first played for the [[All Blacks]] in 1999, and played until his retirement following the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]]. Hammett represented Canterbury 76 times, the Crusaders 81 times, and the All Blacks 30 times (including 29 [[Test match|Tests]]). After retiring from playing, he began coaching, and worked as forwards advisor for both the Crusaders and Canterbury in 2006. He was appointed to succeed Vern Cotter as assistant coach at the Crusaders for the 2007 season.

==Playing career==
===Early career: 1989 - 1997===
Hammett first represented New Zealand, while he was a pupil at [[St Thomas of Canterbury College]], when selected for the New Zealand Under 17 team in 1989.<ref name="ABProfile">{{cite web| url=http://stats.allblacks.com/Profile.asp?ABID=353 |title= 	   	
Mark Hammett |publisher=allblacks.com |accessdate=2007-01-26 |last=Luxford |first=Bob}}</ref> He then captained the Under 19 team in 1991, before making his first appearance for Canterbury in 1992. Although his one game for Canterbury in 1992 was as a replacement, he played seven games the following season.<ref name="ABProfile"/> As hooker, he played mainly as backup to Matt Sexton in 1993; however, by 1994 they were sharing the role. By 1995, Hammett played more games then Sexton.<ref name="ABProfile"/>

Rugby turned professional in late 1995, and in 1996 the Canterbury Crusaders (now called the ''Crusaders'') franchise was established. Hammett became a founding member of the side, which struggled in the inaugural Super 12 finishing in last place.<ref name="CrusadersProfile">{{cite web| url=http://www.crfu.co.nz/main/index.cfm/1,393,1560,html/Mark-Hammett-Assistant-Coach |title=Mark Hammett - Assistant Coach |publisher=crfu.co.nz |accessdate=2007-01-26}}</ref><ref name="Lassen1996">{{cite web| url=http://www.lassen.co.nz/s14tab.php#hrh |title=Super 14 Tables |publisher=lassen.co.nz |accessdate=2007-01-26}}</ref> The 1997 season went better for Hammett; the Crusaders finished sixth, and the Canterbury provincial team won the [[National Provincial Championship]] (NPC) after beating [[Counties Manukau Rugby Union|Counties]] in the final.<ref name="Lassen1996"/> Although Hammett was receiving more and more game time, he still only participated in the NPC final as a replacement.<ref name="ABProfile"/>

===Super 12 success: 1998 - 2001===
Hammett started regularly for both Canterbury, and the Crusaders in 1998. With the latter he won his first Super 12 title. The 1998 Super 12 final was played against the [[Blues (Super rugby franchise)|Blues]] at [[Eden Park]]; Hammett said of the match "If we'd been polled in that week, and had to give an honest answer, most of the boys, deep down, would probably have thought that the Blues would beat us."<ref name="McIlraith84">McIlraith (2005), pg 84.</ref> Despite this, the Crusaders defeated the reigning champions 20-13.<ref name="McIlraith85">McIlraith (2005), pg 85.</ref> Hammett was rewarded with a New Zealand trial, where he captained his team.<ref name="ABProfile"/> He was subsequently selected for New Zealand A and played against [[Tonga national rugby union team|Tonga]].<ref name="ABProfile"/>

The Crusaders achieved more success in 1999 as they finished the [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] in fourth place, then won their semi-final, and final (both away from home) to take another championship.<ref name="McIlraith260">McIlraith (2005), pg 260.</ref> Hammett's achievements with the Crusaders were rewarded by being called into the All Blacks in 1999, at the age of 26. His first game was against New Zealand 'A', on [[June 11]] in Christchurch, quickly followed by his first Test against [[France national rugby union team|France]] on [[June 26]].<ref name="ABProfile"/> Hammett eventually played in the 1999 [[Tri Nations Series|Tri-Nations]], and was selected for the [[1999 Rugby World Cup|World Cup]].

After winning a third title with the Crusaders in 2000, he was again selected for the All Blacks; getting a start against Tonga, and then playing in the Tri-Nations. After returning from All Blacks duty, he played for Canterbury and contributed to a [[Ranfurly Shield]] win over [[Waikato Rugby Union|Waitako]].<ref name="Gifford181">Gifford (2004), pg 181.</ref> Canterbury then reached the NPC final, giving Hammett the opportunity to be part of a Super 12, Ranfurly Shield, and NPC winning team, all in the same year.<ref name="Gifford181">Gifford (2004), pg 181.</ref> [[Wellington Rugby Football Union|Wellington]] won the NPC final however, and the opportunity was lost.<ref name="Gifford182">Gifford (2004), pg 182.</ref> Hammett was then selected for the end-of-year All Blacks tour, and played against France and [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]] (both as a substitute).<ref name="ABProfile"/>

Hammett's 2001 Super 12 season was marred by a shoulder injury, and the Crusaders eventually finished tenth.<ref name="ShoulderInjury">{{cite news| title=Hammer Hits the Right Note |publisher=The Press (Christchurch) |date=[[2001-05-02]] |last=Smith |first=Tony |page=60}}</ref><ref name="NoTour">{{cite news| title=Call to Rest Top Players for Tour |publisher=The Press (Christchurch) |date=[[2001-10-30]] |last=Smith |first=Tony |page=28}}</ref><ref name="Gifford182"/> Due to injury, Hammett only played one game for the All Blacks, as a substitute against [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] in June.<ref name="ABProfile"/> He missed the entire NPC campaign due to injury: an ankle problem which required surgery and causes him to also miss the 2001 end-of-year All Black tour.<ref name="AnkleSurgery">{{cite news| title=Hammett's Future Brightens |publisher=The Press (Christchurch) |date=[[2001-09-11]] |page=34}}</ref><ref name="NoTour">{{cite news| title=Call to Rest Top Players for Tour |publisher=The Press (Christchurch) |date=[[2001-10-30]] |last=Smith |first=Tony |page=28}}</ref>

===Final seasons: 2002 - 2003===
After the 2001 NPC, Crusaders' captain [[Todd Blackadder]] left New Zealand to play rugby in Scotland. During the 2002 Super 12 pre-season, [[Rugby union positions#9. Scrum-half|half-back]] [[Justin Marshall]] questioned which of the senior players were going to step into Blackadder's leadership role for the tough matches.<ref name="McIlraith147">McIlraith (2005), pg 147.</ref> Hammett took the comment "as a slap in the face", as "one player doesn't make a team."<ref name="McIlraith147"/> Hammett later said "I took it that way, and I think a lot of the others must have as well, because we all ended up stepping up!"<ref name="McIlraith147"/> Subsequently, the Crusaders went through the season unbeaten, including a 96-19 victory over the [[New South Wales Waratahs]].<ref name="Gifford189">Gifford (2004), pg 189.</ref> He again played for the All Blacks in 2002, starting against [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] and [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] in the Tri-Nations.<ref name="ABProfile"/> The 2002 NPC season was Hammett's last, and although Canterbury were knocked out in their semi-final, they managed to retain the Ranfurly Shield.<ref name="CrusadersProfile"/> <ref name="Gifford190">Gifford (2004), pg 190.</ref> Hammett's last match was his 76th for Canterbury.<ref name="CrusadersProfile"/>
