The '''Coat of Arms of [[Serbia]]''' is the same as the [[coat of arms]] of the former [[House of Obrenović|Obrenović]] dynasty (first adopted in [[1882]]; re-adopted in 2004) and features the white [[bicephalic eagle]] of the [[House of Nemanjić]] (which in turn took on the eagle from the  [[Palaiologos]] dynasty of the [[Byzantine Empire]]). An [[ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] cape of the style once worn by kings is featured in the background. The double-headed eagle has been used since Byzantine times, the Serbian cross has been used since the 12th century.

==Design==

The principal field stands for the Serbian State. It consists of a double-headed eagle on a red shield; its body and wings in silver, and tongues, beaks, legs and claws in gold, between two golden [[fleurs-de-lys]]. The [[inescutcheon]] stands for the Serbian Nation; in a red shield, a cross between four silver [[firesteel]]s arranged in the quarters around it, all of them facing horizontally outwards.

A [[blazon]] in heraldic terms is: ''Gules, a bicephalic eagle Argent armed Or, two fleurs-de-lys Or. Overall an escutcheon Gules, a cross Argent between four firesteels Argent. All crowned with a royal crown.''
The design on the inescutcheon has been used by Serbian states and the Serbian church since the Middle Ages.

Although Serbia is now a [[republic]], the new coat of arms also features the crown of the former [[List of Serbian monarchs|Serbian monarchy]]. A crown in this manner usually signifies a monarchical form of government. However in recent years several Eastern European nations have used a crown to signify their royal heritage. [[Russia]] and [[Poland]] have similarly both restored coat of arms bearing crowns despite being republics.
