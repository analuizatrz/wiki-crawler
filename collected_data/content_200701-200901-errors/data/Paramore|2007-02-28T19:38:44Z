'''Paramore''' is a pop-punk/emo band from [[Franklin, Tennessee]]. ''[[All We Know Is Falling]]'' is their debut release on the indie label [[Fueled by Ramen]].

== History ==

The Franklin, Tennessee-based band Paramore was formed by three members: brothers Zac and Josh Farro, and Hayley Williams. At the age of 13, Williams moved from her hometown of Meridian, Mississippi to the Nashville suburb, where she met the duo.  After being inducted into a band the Farros were forming, the soon-to-be-named Paramore began to create and perform music that would soon be heard around the world.  In the next few years, Paramore would begin to perform at venues outside the greater Nashville area, including the concert festivals [[Purple Door]] and [[Warped Tour]].  In April 2005, after being seen only once by a record executive for the music label [[Fueled by Ramen]], the band was offered a contract to produce a major market CD.

==All We Know Is Falling==

On July 26, 2005, the band released their first album, ''[[All We Know Is Falling]]''.

On September 12, 2005, a special CD with the previously unreleased track "Oh, Star" hit shelves in Japan.  In addition, in summer 2006 the band carried the ''[[The Summer Tic (Tour EP)]]'' around with them on the [[Warped Tour|2006 Warped Tour]], which contains "Oh, Star," "This Circle" (previously only available on the Fueled by Ramen ''Winter 2006 Sampler''), the original recording of "Emergency" (with the previously removed screaming) and a cover of [[Failure]]'s "Stuck on You." Also, the compilation album ''[[Sound of Superman]]'', in stores as of June 13, 2006, features another Paramore cover--this time of [[Foo Fighters]]' "My Hero."

==Second album==

Paramore has slated to record their second album from December 2006 to March 2007. Paramore aim to release the album in June according to an [[Alternative Press]] radio interview. Paramore will be co-headlining Warped Tour 2007 and have a headlining tour in April with [[This Providence]] and [[The Almost]] They have stated they will play around 3 new songs and confirmed the song 'Hallelujah' will be on the new record. A demo version of 'Hallelujah' was leaked onto the internet in 2005, it was recorded whilst Paramore were recording their debut.
