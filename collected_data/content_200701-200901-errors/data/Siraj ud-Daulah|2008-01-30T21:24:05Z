'''Mîrzâ Mohammad Sirâjud Dawla''', more popularly known as ''Siraj-Ud-Daulah'', ([[1733]] &ndash; [[July 2]], [[1757]]) was the last independent [[Nawab]] of [[Bengal]], [[Bihar]] and [[Orissa]]. The end of his reign marks the start of [[British East India Company]] rule in India. He was also called as "Sir Roger Dowlett" by many of the  British who were unable to pronounce his name correctly in  Hindustani.

==Early years==

Siraj's father Zain Uddin was the ruler of [[Bihar]] and his mother Amina Begum was the youngest daughter of Nawab [[Ali Vardi Khan]]. Since Ali Vardi had no son, Siraj, as his grandson, became very close to him and since his childhood was seen by many as successor to the throne of Murshidabad. Accordingly, he was raised at the nawab's palace with all necessary education and training suitable for a future nawab. Young Siraj also accompanied Ali Vardi in his military ventures against the [[Maratha]]s in 1746.

Ali Vardi Khan in 1752 officially declared his grandson Crown Prince and successor to the throne, creating no small amount of division in the family and the royal court.

==Reign as Nawab==
Mirza Mohammad Siraj succeeded [[Ali Vardi Khan]] as the [[Nawab]] of [[Bengal]] in April [[1756]] at the age of 23, and took the name Siraj-Ud-Daulah. He, as the direct political disciple of his grand  father, was aware of global British interest of colonization and hence, resented British politico-military presence in Bengal. He was annoyed at the company's alleged involvement with and instigation of some of his own court in a conspiracy to oust him. His charges against the company were mainly threefold. First, that they strengthened the fortification around the Fort William without any intimation and approval; second, that they grossly abused the trade privileges granted to them by the Mughal rulers, which caused heavy loss of customs duties for the government; and third, that they gave shelter to some of his officers, for example Krisnadas, son of Rajballav, who fled [[Dhaka]] after misappropriating government funds. Hence, when the East India Company started further enhancement of military preparedness at Fort William in Calcutta, Siraj, as the ruler of Bengal, ask the company to stop. As the company did not heed to his directives, he raised his army and captured [[Kolkata]] from the British in June [[1756]]. During this time, he is alleged to have put 146 British subjects in a 20 by 20 foot chamber, known as the infamous [[Black Hole of Calcutta]]; only 23 were said to have survived the overnight ordeal. While some later historians have claimed that the entire incident was a figment of imagination invented by the British to belittle him, the account of this incident by one survivor - Holwell - obtained wide circulation in England and helped gain support for the East India Company's continued conquest of India in those days.

Sirajuddaula's nomination to the nawabship aroused the jealousy and enmity of Ghaseti Begum (eldest sister of Siraj's mother), Raja Rajballabh, Mir Jafar Ali Khan and Shawkat Jang (Siraj's cousin). Ghaseti Begam possessed huge wealth, which was the source of her influence and strength. Apprehending serious opposition from her, Sirajuddaula seized her wealth from Motijheel Palace and placed her in confinement. The nawab also gave high government positions to his favourites. Mir Mardan was appointed Bakshi (Paymaster of the army) in place of Mir Jafar. Mohanlal was elevated to the post of peshkar of his Dewan Khana and he exercised great influence in the administration. Eventually Siraj suppressed Shaukat Jang, governor of [[Purnia]], who was killed in a clash.

The accession of Sirajuddaula threatened the position of the dominant faction of the ruling group in [[Murshidabad]], which was engaged in accumulating wealth during the time of the earlier nawabs. With his assumption of the reins of government, this group recognized that he would be a danger to their self-enrichment, as he was trying to raise another group to counterbalance the old one which had usurped the power of the nawab to a great extent. Sirajuddaula was a threat to the British also because he made it absolutely clear that unlike the previous nawabs, he would not put up with the abuse of dastaks by the British and their illegal private trade. The threat came at a crucial time when the private trade of the Company's servants was facing a severe crisis.

==The Battle of Plassey==
[[Image:Clive.jpg|thumb|200px|Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive, meeting with Mir Jafar after Plassey, by Francis Hayman]]After Siraj-Ud-Daulah lost the [[Battle of Plassey]] to the [[United Kingdom|British]], a victory aided by the treachery of his former army chief [[Mir Jafar]] he escaped to [[Murshidabad]] and then to [[Patna]] by boat. He was eventually arrested by Mir Jafar's soldiers. After few days, Siraj Ud Daulah, the last independent ruler of [[Bengal]], was executed on [[July 2]], [[1757]] by [[Mohammad Ali Beg]] under orders from Mir Jafar. He left behind his mother Amina Begum, wife Begum Lutfunnissa, daughter Umme Zohra and brother Mirza Mehdi.

==The character of Siraj-Ud-Daulah==
Although proclaimed as a freedom fighter in modern India, Bangladesh and Pakistan for his opposition to the British annexation, many historians of the period report that he was cruel and his opposition to the British was not out of any nationalistic fervor, but an expression of his desire to strengthen his own power. As a teenager, he led a reckless life, which came to the notice of his grandfather. But keeping a promise he made to his dear grandfather on his death bed, he gave up gambling and drinking alcohol totally after becoming the nawab. He was a fierce fighter against the Marathas and the pirates of Southern Bengal as a prince during 1740s, but his forces were later totally routed by the greatly outnumbered British.

''"Siraj-ud-daula has been pictured"'', says the biographer of  [[Lord Clive|Robert Clive]], ''"as a monster of vice, cruelty and depravity."''. In 1778, Robert Orme wrote of the relationship with his maternal grandfather Ali Vardi Khan:

''"Mirza Mahmud Siraj, a youth of seventeen years, had discovered the most vicious propensities, at an age when only follies are expected from princes. But the great affection which Allaverdy [Ali Vardi] had borne to the father was transferred to this son, whom he had for some years bred in his own palace; where instead of correcting the evil dispositions of his nature, he suffered them to increase by overweening indulgence: born without compassion, it was one of the amusements of Mirza Mahmud's childhood to torture birds and animals; and, taught by his minions to regard himself as of a superior order of being, his natural cruelty, hardened by habit, rendered him as insensible to the sufferings of his own species as of the brute creation [animals]: in conception he was not slow, but absurd; obstinate, sullen, and impatient of contradiction; but notwithstanding this insolent contempt of mankind, innate cowardice, the confusion of his ideas rendered him suspicious of all those who approached him, excepting his favourites, who were buffoons and profligate men, raised from menial servants to be his companions: with these he lived in every kind of intemperance and debauchery, and more especially in drinking spiritous liquors to an excess, which inflamed his passions and impaired the little understanding with which he was born. He had, however, cunning enough to carry himself with much demureness in the presence of Allaverdy, whom no one ventured to inform of his real character; for in despotic states the sovereign is always the last to hear what it concerns him most to know."''

Two Muslim historians of the period wrote of him, and both made specific mention of his exceptional cruelty and arrogance. 

[[Ghulam Husain Salim]] wrote{{ref|riyas}}:

''"Owing to Siraj ud Dowla’s harshness of temper and indulgence, fear and terror had settled on the hearts of everyone to such an extent that no one among his generals of the army or the noblemen of the city was free from anxiety. Amongst his officers, whoever went to wait on Siraj ud Dowla despaired of life and honour, and whoever returned without being disgraced and ill-treated offered thanks to God. Siraj ud Dowla treated all the noblemen and generals of Mahabat Jang [Ali Vardi Khan] with ridicule and drollery, and bestowed on each some contemptuous nickname that ill-suited any of them. And whatever harsh expressions and abusive epithet came to his lips, Siraj ud Dowla uttered them unhesitatingly in the face of everyone, and no one had the boldness to breath freely in his presence."'

[[Ghulam Husain Tabatabai]] had this{{ref|seir}} to say about him:

''"Making no distinction between vice and virtue, he carried defilement wherever he went, and, like a man alienated in his mind, he made the house of men and women of distinction the scenes of his depravity, without minding either rank or station. In a little time he became detested as Pharaoh, and people on meeting him by chance used to say, ‘God save us from him!'"''
