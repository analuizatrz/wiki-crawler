'''Dave Devall''' is the long time weatherman at television station [[CFTO]] in [[Toronto, Ontario]], having worked there since 1961.

Devall is a graduate of York Memorial Collegiate in the former City of York and joined CFTO shortly after the station went on air.  Devall is best known in Canada as [[Jim Perry (television)|Jim Perry]]'s announcer on many of his game shows, including ''[[Definition (TV series)|Definition]]'', ''[[Headline Hunters]]'' and ''[[Eye Bet]]''.

Despite various new weathercasters, Devall remains the senior and top weatherman at the station, and also appears daily on [[CTV Newsnet]]. His funny antics have made him popular with Toronto viewers. During his early years, he would stand behind a clear [[acrylic glass]] weather map, which necessitated writing backwards with a marker. He continues the tradition today with a single daily weather word (since the weather maps are now generated electronically.)
