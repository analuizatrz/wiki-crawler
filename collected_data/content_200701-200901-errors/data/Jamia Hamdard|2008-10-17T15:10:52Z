==History==  

In 1906, a small [[Unani]] clinic was established by Hakeem Hafiz Abdul Majeed, one of the well-known practitioners of Unani System of Medicine of his time. He had a vision of making the practice of Unani Medicine into a scientific discipline, so that Unani medicines could be dispensed in a more efficacious manner to patients. He gave the name "Hamdard" to his venture which means "sympathy for all and sharing of pain". 

On 22 Shawwal, 1367 Hijri (1948 August 28), Hamdard - which was a commercial enterprise at that time - was converted into a [[waqf]], with the aim of giving effect to Islamic teachings of public charity including health and education. In 1964, Hamdard National Foundation was created to receive and disburse the profits earned by Hamdard (Wakf) Laboratories. It was to take up charitable causes in the areas of education, medical relief and the advancement of knowledge.

The son of Hakeem Hafiz Abdul Majeed, Hakeem Abdul Hameed, purchased land in [[Tughlaqabad]], area of South Delhi. He and his Muslim associates established several institutions for teaching and research there.

In 1962, Hakeem Abdul Hameed set up the Institute of History of Medicine and Medical Research, to promote education and research in the history of medicine.

In 1963, Hakeem Abdul Hameed and his Muslim friends and associates set up Indian Institute of Islamic Studies, to promote the study of Islamic culture and civilization, especially its contribution to Indian society and culture.

In 1963, Hamdard Tibbi College was set up in Gali Qasim Jaan, Old Delhi. It was later shifted to Jamia Hamdard Campus in 1980 to provide education in Unani Medicine, so that it could be largely available in Arabic and Persian.

In 1972, Hamdard College of Pharmacy was set up with the objective of providing education and training in all branches of pharmacy. 

Jamia Hamdard was given the status of [[Deemed University]], by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, on 1989 May 10. All the above named institutions were combined into Jamia Hamdard.
