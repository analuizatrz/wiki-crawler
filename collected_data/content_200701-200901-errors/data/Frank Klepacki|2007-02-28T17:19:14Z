He scored several games there, including the [[Lands of Lore|''Lands of Lore'' series]],  the [[Dune II|''Dune'' games]], the [[The Legend of Kyrandia|''The Legend of Kyrandia'' series]], ''[[Blade Runner (video game)|Blade Runner]]'', and the ''Command & Conquer'' series.

==Early life and career==
[[Image:Oldwestwoodstudio.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Frank Klepacki's office at the old Westwood Studios building around 1995]]

After learning to program [[BASIC]] on a [[Tandy 1000]] and becoming interested in [[computer and video games]], he applied for a job as a [[game tester]] at Westwood studios.<ref name="logbookinterview" /> He submitted his demo tape to the company's audio director.<ref name="944magazine" /> The growing company enlisted him as a composer for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] port of ''[[DragonStrike (computer game)|DragonStrike]]'' and the computer game ''[[Eye of the Beholder (computer game)|Eye of the Beholder II]]''.<ref name="944magazine" /> He later composed with [[MIDI]] sequencing for several other ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' games.<Ref name="behindcc">{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Behind the C&C Soundtrack | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com frankklepacki.com] | accessdate=27 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> In 1992, he helmed the audio of ''[[Dune II]]'', attempting to complement the music of the original ''[[Dune (computer game)|Dune]]''.<Ref name="avaultinterview">{{cite web | date=2006-09-17 | title=Good to the Last Note | author=Josh Horowitz | url=http://www.avault.com/articles/getarticle.asp?name=lastnote&page=4 | work=[http://www.avault.com/ Adrenaline Vault] | accessdate=27 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> He later noted that he pushed the sequencing program on his [[Amiga]] to the limit while scoring the game.<Ref name="gwjinterview">{{cite web | date=21-03-06 | title=Gamers With Jobs Radio: Interview with Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/taxonomy/term/318 | work=[http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/ Gamers with Jobs] | accessdate=22 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref> While working on ''[[The Lion King#Video games|Disney's The Lion King]]'' in 1994, he and the Westwood team were shown sketches of the unfinished feature film.<ref name="interviewfaq">{{cite web | title=Interview FAQ | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com frankklepacki.com] | accessdate=27 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Film composer [[Hans Zimmer]] later praised Klepacki for reworking his scores.<Ref name="music4gamesinterview">{{cite web | date=2006-01-22 | title=Interview with Star Wars: Empire At War Audio Director and composer Frank Klepacki | author=Music4Games staff | url=http://www.music4games.net/Features_Display.aspx?id=6 | work=[http://www.music4games.net Music4Games] | accessdate=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> After finishing ''[[The Legend of Kyrandia|The Legend of Kyrandia III]]'', Frank Klepacki met with Westwood leaders to discuss the upcoming game ''[[Command & Conquer]]''—the first in a series which would bring him wider fame and critical acclaim.<ref name="behindcc" />

===Command and Conquer series===
[[Image:Cctd.gif|right|thumb|200px|''Command & Conquer'', a career turning point]]
In 1994, Frank Klepacki met with Westwood Studios developers to discuss the soundtrack of the company's next project—''Command & Conquer''. To define the game's style, Klepacki listened to a number of bands.<ref name="behindcc" /> He combined various elements of this music and added his own touch to create a unique sound. With the company's recent shift to 22 [[Hertz|kHz]] audio, Klepacki composed with an ASR-10 sampler, a [[Roland]] S760 sampler, a Roland JD 990 synth module, and an [[electric guitar]].<ref name="behindcc" /> The first few songs he composed for ''Command & Conquer'' contained voice samples—including the notable pieces ''Act on Instinct'' and ''No Mercy''. The samples were later found to interfere with the game's spoken audio, and the voices were removed. Complete versions of the songs later appeared on the game's commercial soundtrack.<ref name="behindcc" /> Klepacki next composed instrumental pieces, drawing influences from  [[orchestra|orchestral]], [[house music|house]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and [[hip hop music]]. For the [[Credit (creative arts)|credits]], Klepacki wrote ''Airstrike'', featuring a hook later used in ''[[Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun]]'' for the [[Global Defense Initiative]]. Conversely, the [[Brotherhood of Nod]] ending used the song ''Destructible Times'' written by Klepacki's local band, [[I AM]]. Developers requested the song because it "reflected the war aspect and bad-ass vibe of [Nod's] side."<ref name="behindcc" /> The ''C&C'' expansion pack ''Covert Operations'' featured new [[ambient music|ambient]] pieces.<ref name="behindcc" /> Though the soundtrack was not released through retail, Westwood sold it by special order through its website and in game catalogues.<ref name="westwoodcatalogue">{{Cite book | year=2000 | author=Westwood Studios | title=The Westwood Studios Catalog | publisher=Westwood Studios | language=English}}</ref>

[[Image:Klepackicameo.png|left|thumb|320px|Frank Klepacki and [[Joseph D. Kucan]] in a ''[[Command & Conquer: Red Alert|Red Alert]]'' cut scene]]
While working on ''Covert Operations'', Frank Klepacki composed ''Hell March''. Upon listening, director [[Brett Sperry]] insisted this song be used as the signature theme of ''Command & Conquer: Red Alert.''<ref name="behindcc" /> Originally intended for use with the Brotherhood of Nod, it features militaristic samples—including marching, industrial sounds, and a commander shouting what sounded like "we want war, wake up!" (but actually a German drill instructor shouting "Die waffen - legt an!", roughly translated as "Bring rifles to fighting position") <ref name="behindra">{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Behind the Red Alert Soundtrack | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com frankklepacki.com] | accessdate=27 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Klepacki initially scored ''Red Alert'' with sci-fi camp in mind, but early songs were shelved. He switched gears to write gritty pieces, prompting the ''Red Alert'' team to expand upon the style of ''Command & Conquer''.<Ref name="behindra" /> In preparing to compose, Klepacki acquired new sample libraries for unique and strange sounds. Particular creative moods would result in a few songs at a time.<ref name="behindra" /> He first wrote heavy songs like ''Workmen'' and ''Crush'', then composed neutral, synthesizer-laden music, such as ''Vector'' and ''Roll Out''. Klepacki scored ''Fogger'' and ''Mud'', one of his personal favorites, before finishing with ''Militant Force'' and ''Radio 2''. He took breaks from working to make cameo appearances as a Soviet soldier killed by [[Joseph D. Kucan]] and an Allied commander in the [[cut scene]]s of ''Red Alert''. He previously appeared as a [[Brotherhood of Nod|Nod]] soldier and the voice of the commando in ''Command & Conquer'' and would voice bit parts in future Westwood games.<ref name="actingcameos">{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Frank's acting cameos | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com frankklepacki.com] | accessdate=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

After completing ''Red Alert'', he took a short break to review his work. He concluded that some songs could be enhanced, but ''Red Alert'' had already gone [[Development stage#Gold.2Fgeneral availability release|gold]], precluding new versions.<ref name="behindra" /> These remixes later appeared on the unsuccessful ''Command & Conquer: Sole Survivor''. ''Red Alert''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s soundtrack was voted best video game soundtrack of 1996 by [[PC Gamer]] and Gameslice magazines, defeating [[Trent Reznor]]'s score for ''[[Quake]]''.<ref name="behindra" /><ref name="music4gamesinterview" /> Reviewers called it "fun to listen to" and "second to none."<ref name="gamespotredalert">{{cite web | author=Vince Broady | date=1996-11-26 | title=Review of Red Alert | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/commandconquerredalert/review.html | work=[http://www.gamespot.com/ Gamespot] | accessdate=23 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="darkzeroredalert">{{cite web | date=2002-12-29 | title=Review of Red Alert | url=http://darkzero.co.uk/index2.php?articleid=12 | work=[http://wwww.darkzero.co.uk DarkZero] | accessdate=23 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref> As of 2005, ''Red Alert'' has sold 35 million game units, bringing Klepacki his widest audience.<ref name="guinness">{{Cite book | year=2005 | editor=Claire Folkard | title=The Guinness Book of World Records | publisher=Bantam Books | language=English | id=0553588109 }}</ref> He wrote additional music for the game's [[expansion pack]]s, ''Counterstrike'' and ''Aftermath''. He attributed the success of ''Red Alert'' to an infusion of modern styles not found in other games.<ref name="petroglyphpodcast">{{cite web | title=Frank Klepacki Podcast | url=http://www.petroglyphgames.com/news/index.php?id=60&year=2006 | work=[http://www.petroglyphgames.com/ Petroglyph Games] | accessdate=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Later games==

In 1997, Frank Klepacki scored a ''[[Blade Runner]]'' adaptation and in 1998 composed for ''[[Dune 2000]]''. He attempted to update the music from ''[[Dune II]]'' into "this non-blip stuff."<ref name="avaultinterview" /> ''Dune 2000'' was panned by critics, though Klepacki's score was praised for adhering to the traditional ''Dune'' style.<ref name="gamespotdune2000">{{cite web | author=Ron Dulin | date=1997-12-03 | title=Review of Dune 2000 | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/bladerunner/review.html | work=[http://www.gamespot.com/ Gamespot] | accessdate=23 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref> He composed for ''[[Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun]]'' with [[Jarrid Mendelson]]—with whom he would later collaborate on ''[[Emperor: Battle for Dune]]''.<Ref name="videogamesheet" /> ''Tiberian Sun'' featured dark, ambient [[techno music]] and ambient space music suited to the game's post-apocalyptic/space/ futuristic setting.<ref name="tsreview">{{cite web | title=Review of Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun | author=The Logbook staff | url=http://www.thelogbook.com/disc/q3-02/t.htm | work=[http://www.thelogbook.com The Logbook] | accessdate=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Klepacki cited the piece "Mad Rap" as his favorite. An avid ''[[Star Wars]]'' fan, he enjoyed scoring [[cut scenes]] featuring [[James Earl Jones]], the voice of [[Darth Vader]].<ref name="petroglyphpodcast" /> He next scored ''[[Lands of Lore]] III'' and ''[[Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2]]''. Klepacki defined ''Red Alert 2''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s style with heavy metal guitar and fast-paced beats.<ref name="ra2review">{{cite web | title=Review of Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 | author=The Logbook staff | url=http://www.thelogbook.com/disc/q3-02/r.htm | work=[http://www.thelogbook.com The Logbook] | accessdate=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Klepacki scored the game with a [[Korg]] Tr-rack, [[Novation]], and [[Roland]] 5080.<ref name="westwoodnetinterview">{{cite web | year=2001 | title=Frank Klepacki Interview (Yuri's Revenge) | url=http://www.westwoodi.net/read.php?Articles/Frank_Klepacki_Interview | work=[http://www.westwoodi.net Westwood Infiltration] | accessdate=28 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref> ''Red Alert 2''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s included a remix of "Hell March".

For ''[[Command & Conquer: Renegade]]''—the next entry in the series—Klepacki tried to update the style of the original ''Command & Conquer'' by making it "hipper and more elaborate."<ref name="avaultinterview" /> Several ''Command & Conquer'' mainstays appear as reworked versions, including ''Target (Mechanical Man)'', ''Industrial'', ''Act on Instinct'', and ''No Mercy''.

Though Frank Klepacki offered to score ''[[Command & Conquer: Generals]]'' and submitted a demo to EA, he was not contacted to compose.<ref name="interviewfaq" /> Klepacki took a brief hiatus to work on solo albums, then joined [[Petroglyph (game studio)|Petroglyph]] games as full-time audio director in 2004.<ref name="petroglyphpodcast" /> He prepared by becoming versed in the job's requirements and demands.<ref name="petroglyphpodcast" /> His first task was scoring ''[[Star Wars: Empire at War]]'', Petroglyph's launch title; he also helped select voice actors.<ref name="askpetroglyph1">{{cite web | title=Some questions for everyone at Petroglyph | url=http://www.petroglyphgames.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=1012&hl=klepacki | work=[http://www.petroglyphgames.com/forums/ Petrogylph Forums] | accessdate=2 January | accessyear=2007}}</ref> A die-hard fan of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise, Klepacki enjoyed complementing [[John Williams]]'s style as he worked with sound effects used in the feature films.<ref name="music4gamesinterview" /> He worked closely with programmers to ensure perfect aural functionality. Though most the game's score is John Williams's work, Klepacki estimates that he contributed 20% original material. Apart from the main theme, he aimed to minimize his editing in order to retain the classic ''Star Wars'' sound.<ref name="music4gamesinterview" /> He chiefly composed for new areas of the ''Star Wars'' universe only found in ''Empire at War''. He calls his work on the game "the peak of my career,"<ref name="petroglyphpodcast" /> and felt he had spent his entire life grooming his abilities for that soundtrack.<ref name="gwjinterview" />

For the ''Forces of Corruption'' expansion pack, he took greater creative liberty with the ''Star Wars'' feel by writing an original theme for the new criminal faction.<ref name="petroglyphpodcast" /> In attempting to compose this piece, he wrote several preliminary hooks that were later integrated into the game's battle themes.<ref name="gamespotdiary5">{{cite web | title=Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption Designer Diary #5 - The Sounds of Corruption | date=2006-10-17 | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/starwarsempireatwarforces/news.html?sid=6159916 | work=[http://www.gamespot.com/ Gamespot.com] | accessdate=2 January | accessyear=2007}}</ref> He composed six pieces for the expansion total, including the finale theme.

Frank Klepacki's solo work debuted in 2002 with ''[[Morphscape]]''. Production began in 1996 with the song ''Cybertek'', though an album was not planned at this time. The rest of ''Morphscape''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s songs were composed after ''Red Alert 2''. Klepacki composed the album's title track while working on ''Command & Conquer: Renegade'', and feels the game's style is visibly present in ''Morphscape''.<ref name="morphscape" /> Klepacki released the final product after Westwood's dissolution. His biggest inspiration in creating solo works is the legion of fans interested in ''Command & Conquer''.<ref name="music4gamesinterview2">{{cite web | author=Jay Semerad | year=2002 | title=Interview with Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.music4games.net/f_frankklepacki_morphscape.html | work=[http://www.music4games.net/ Music4Games] | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20031227123848/http://www.music4games.net/f_frankklepacki_morphscape.html | archivedate=2003-12-27 | accessdate=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Klepacki took a hiatus from composing video game music to write two other solo albums, the first of which is entitled ''[[Rocktronic]]''. Released in 2004, the album has been described as dark, edgy, and heavy in a way that will appeal to ''Command & Conquer'' fans.<ref name="personalprojects">{{cite web | title=Personal Projects | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com frankklepacki] | accessdate=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Klepacki sought out specific samples and instruments used in the Command & Conquer soundtrack for use in ''Rocktronic''.<ref name="creatingrock">{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Creating Rocktronic | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com frankklepacki.com] | accessdate=2 January | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Featuring live drumming in certain songs, the album is Klepacki's best-seller and was well received by his fans.<ref name="creatingrock" /> Following ''Rocktronic'' was ''[[Virtual Control]]'', released in 2005. Klepacki complemented his usual style with experiments in hip hop on the album. Tracks from each release have been periodically used in ''[[The Ultimate Fighter]]''.<ref name="personalprojects" />

On August 1, 2006, he revealed his next solo project would be named ''Awakening of Aggression'' and confirmed the music would be "heavy" and "hard-hitting."<ref name="klepackinews" /> When interviewed, Klepacki said that he channeled stress into the heavy music of the new album.<ref name="music4gamesfoc" /> ''Aggression'' was released in October of the same year, and was made available on [[iTunes]] on December 7. He filled the liner notes of the album with the names of several supportive fans who had purchased his music.<ref name="klepackinews" />

==Work and beliefs==

When composing for video games, Frank Klepacki spends a few days to compose and master one song on average.<ref name="imperiuminterview">{{cite web | title=Interview with Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.imperium-ww.pl/articles.php?article_id=30 | work=[http://www.imperium-ww.pl/ Imperium Westwood] | accessdate=28 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref> He feels writing music for games is somewhat difficult as only early [[software build]]s are available to play. He sometimes must compose songs based off vague descriptions.<ref name="westwoodnetinterview" /> Composing for cut scenes is easier by comparison.<ref name="westwoodnetinterview" /> Nonetheless, he prefers to compose for a game throughout its development rather than write songs for a finished product.<ref name="petropo2" /> He has said that the most rewarding part of composing video game music is working with a team—which he compares to chemistry between band members—and knowing he is part of a greater cause.<ref name="petroglyphpodcast" /> He believes that game music could improve if artists focused on quality and derived inspiration from playing games.<ref name="music4gamesinterview" /> He has expressed interest in having Electronic Arts sell his soundtracks in retail stores, preferably next to video games in electronic departments.<ref name="music4gamesinterview4">{{cite web | title=Video Game Soundtrack Report 1.0 | url=http://www.music4games.net/f_soundtracks_report_1.html | work=[http://www.music4games.net/ Music4Games] | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021107110623/http://www.music4games.net/f_soundtracks_report_1.html | archivedate=2002-11-07 | accessdate=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> He advises those wishing to get in the video game business to attend conventions and investigate developer companies.<ref name="petroglyphpodcast" />

Klepacki runs a personal [http://www.frankklepacki.com website] featuring a biography, archived interviews, and a playlist of songs [[streaming media|streamed]] in 128 [[Kilobit per second|kbit/s]] [[mp3]]. His music is also available from [[iTunes]]. As a ''Star Wars'' fan, he has extensively written about the film premieres of the last two prequels on his website.<ref name="klepackistarwars">{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Frank at ''Star Wars'' Celebration 2 | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com frankklepacki] | accessdate=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> He maintains an account at [[Youtube]] and has posted three videos of his work with other bands.<Ref name="video">{{cite web | year=2006 | title=Youtube: Flyrecords1 | url=http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=flyrecords1 | accessdate=2 January | accessyear=2007}}</ref>, believing the medium to be the pinnacle of quality.<ref name="digitalcinema">{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Digital Cinema | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com frankklepacki.com] | accessdate=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> He has scored two short films, and won a [[Cinevegas]] award for his work with ''Unreel Invasion''.<Ref name="aboutme">{{cite web | title=Frank Klepacki: About Me | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com frankklepacki.com] | accessdate=27 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Klepacki believes that the genre of video game music is more respected than it has ever been. He notes that complex and quality music comes at a higher cost, prompting certain producers to simply "get somebody who could cop the Hollywood sound" instead of nurturing original style.<ref name="gwjinterview" /> When asked about his career low-point, he named ''[[Order of the Griffon]]'' for the [[TurboGrafx-16]], citing difficulties with the system's limited musical capabilities.<ref name="gwjinterview" />

Klepacki is not seeking a record deal, citing a "horrible chain of steps to getting famous." Scathingly critical of the [[recording industry]], he blames [[MTV]] for putting a pretty face on music and destroying the independent valuation of actual sound.<ref name="klepackirecorddeal">{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Record Deals | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com frankklepacki] | accessdate=28 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> He has also criticized [[lip-synching]] and the repackaging of music genre through different labels—such as [[Nu metal]] for [[rock music]] and [[Neo soul]] for [[soul music]].<ref name="klepackirecorddeal" /> He believes that signing a deal does not guarantee profits, and would rather keep his [[day job]] as audio director. These sentiments were echoed in a special feature on the band [[Home Cookin']] in 2000—Klepacki said the group wanted to "work with a label, not for them."<ref name="homecookin0">{{cite web | title=Sonic Garden: Home Cookin' | url=http://www.sonicgarden.com/sonic-web/artist.cfm?artistid=4960 | work=[http://www.sonicgarden.com/ Sonic Garden] | accessdate=25 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref> He champions the internet as a medium through which creative and original artists can be found. Klepacki believes it is the preferred avenue for music when compared to radio [[airplay (song)|airplay]]—where one hears "the exact same songs 3 months at a time."<ref name="klepackirecorddeal" /> When interviewed about file-sharing, he expressed mixed emotions.<ref name="westwoodnetinterview" /> He believes that the high price of [[compact disc]]s could prompt one to download music. Conversely, he notes that artists—who "don't get as much money as you think"—need to be compensated for their work.<ref name="westwoodnetinterview" /> His favorite artists by decade, starting with the [[1960s]], are [[Sly and the Family Stone]], [[Graham Central Station]], [[Metallica]], [[Home Cookin']], and [[Bob Schneider]].<ref name="favorites">{{cite web | title=Where My Rockers At? | url=http://www.petroglyphgames.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=191&hl=klepacki&st=20 | work=[http://www.petroglyphgames.com/ Petroglyph Games] | accessdate=2 January | accessyear=2007}}</ref>
