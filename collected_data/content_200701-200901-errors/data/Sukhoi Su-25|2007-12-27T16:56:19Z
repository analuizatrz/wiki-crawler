The '''Sukhoi Su-25''' is a single-seat, twin-engine jet aircraft developed in the [[Soviet Union]] by the [[Sukhoi|Sukhoi Design Bureau]]. It was designed to provide [[close air support]] for the [[Red Army|Soviet Ground Forces]].  The first prototype made its maiden flight on [[22 February]] [[1975]]. After testing, the aircraft went into series production in 1978 at [[Tbilisi]] in the [[Georgian SSR|Soviet Republic of Georgia]]. NATO assigned the new aircraft the [[NATO reporting name|reporting name]] "Frogfoot".

Early variants included the Su-25UB two-seat trainer,  the Su-25BM for target-towing, and the Su-25K for export customers. Upgraded variants developed by Sukhoi include the Su-25T and the further improved Su-25TM. As of 2007, the Su-25 is the only armoured airplane still in production except the [[Sukhoi Su-34|Su-34]] whose production just started.<ref name="Frogfoot">Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes </ref> It is currently in service with [[Russia]] and various other [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] states as well as export customers.

During its more than twenty-five years in service, the Su-25 has seen combat with several air forces. It was heavily involved in the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]], flying [[counter-insurgency]] missions against the [[Mujahideen]]. The [[Iraqi Air Force]] employed Su-25s against Iran during the 1980–89 [[Iran-Iraq War]]. Most of them were later destroyed or fled to Iran in the 1991 [[Gulf War]]. In 1993, they were used by [[Abkhazia]]n [[separatist]]s against [[Georgians]] during [[War in Abkhazia (1992–1993)|Abkhazian War]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979327,00.html Siege of Sukhumi], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', October 04, 1993</ref> Eight years later, the [[Military of the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian Air Force]] employed Su-25s against Albanian separatists in the [[2001 Macedonia conflict]].

==Development==

In early 1968, the Soviet Ministry of Defence decided to develop a specialised ''shturmovik'' armoured assault aircraft in order to provide close air support for the [[Red Army|Soviet Ground Forces]]. The idea of creating a ground-support aircraft came about after analysing the experience of ''shturmovoi'' (attack) aviation during [[World War II]], and in local wars during the 1950s and 1960s.<ref name="Development">Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.6-7.</ref> The Soviet fighter-bombers in service or under development at this time ([[Sukhoi Su-7|Su-7]], [[Sukhoi Su-17|Su-17]], [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]] and [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23]]) did not meet the requirements for close air support of the army.<ref name="Development" /> They lacked essential armour plating to protect the pilot and vital equipment from ground fire and missile hits, and their high flight speeds made it difficult for the pilot to maintain visual contact with a target. Having taken into account these problems, [[Pavel Sukhoi]] and a group of leading specialists in the Sukhoi Design Bureau started preliminary design work in a comparatively short period of time, with the assistance of leading institutes of the Ministry of the Aviation Industry and the Ministry of Defence.<ref>Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.8.</ref>

[[Image:Su-25artistconcept.jpg|thumb|left|Artist's concept drawing of the Su-25]]

In March 1969, a competition was announced by the [[Soviet Air Force]] that called for designs for a new battlefield close-support aircraft. Participants in the competition were the Sukhoi Design Bureau and the Design Bureaux of [[Yakovlev]], [[Ilyushin]] and [[Mikoyan]].<ref>Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.11.</ref> Sukhoi finalised its "T-8" design in late 1968, and began in work on the first two prototypes (T8-1 and T8-2) in January 1972. The T8-1, the first airframe to be assembled, was completed just before a major national holiday on [[9 May]] [[1974]]. However, it did not make its first flight until [[22 February]] [[1975]], after a long series of test flights by [[Vladimir Ilyushin]]. The Su-25 surpassed its main competitor in the Soviet Air Force competition, the [[Ilyushin Il-102]], and series production was announced by the Ministry of Defence.<ref>Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.23-41.</ref>

During flight-testing phases of the T8-1 and T8-2 prototypes' development, the Sukhoi Design Bureau's management proposed that the series production of the Su-25 should start at Factory No. 31 in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Soviet Republic of Georgia]], which at that time was the major manufacturing base for the MiG-21UM "Mongol-B" trainer. After negotiations and completion of all stages of the state trials, the Soviet Ministry of Aircraft Production authorised manufacture of the Su-25 at Tbilisi, allowing series production to start in 1978.<ref name="Variants" />

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, several Su-25 variants appeared, including modernised versions, and variants for specialised roles. The most significant designs were the Su-25UB dual-seat trainer, the Su-25BM target-towing variant, and the Su-25T for antitank missions. In addition, an Su-25KM prototype was developed by [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in co-operation with Israeli company [[Elbit Systems]] in 2001, but so far this variant has not achieved much commercial success. The Su-25 is the only armoured aircraft still in production in 2007.<ref name="Frogfoot">''Sukhoi Su-25 Frogfoot'', Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, Airlife 2004</ref>  

The [[Russian Air Force]] operates the largest number of Su-25s, and has plans to upgrade older aircraft to the Su-25SM variant. However, this process has been slowed due to a funding shortfall, as of early 2007 only seven aircraft had been modified.

==Design==

The Su-25 has a normal [[aerodynamic]] layout with a shoulder-mounted [[trapezoidal]] wing and a conventional [[tailplane]] and [[rudder]]. Several different [[metals]] in differing amounts are used in the construction of the [[airframe]]: 60% [[aluminium]], 19% [[steel]], 13.5% [[titanium]], 2% [[magnesium alloy]], and 5.5% other materials.<ref name="Design2">Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.73-75.</ref>

===Cockpit===

The [[aircraft pilot|pilot]] sits on a [[NPP Zvezda|Zvezda]] K-36 ejection seat, and has standard [[flight instruments]].<ref name="Design2" /> At the rear of the [[cockpit]] is a 6 mm (0.24 in) thick steel headrest, mounted on the rear bulkhead. The cockpit has a bathtub-shaped armoured enclosure of [[welded]] titanium sheets, with transit ports located in the walls. Guide rails for the [[ejection seat]] are mounted on the rear wall of the cockpit. 

The [[cannon]] is located in a compartment beneath the cockpit, mounted on a load-bearing beam attached to the cockpit floor and the forward fuselage support structure. An airtight avionics compartment is behind the cockpit and in front of the forward fuel tank. On the left-hand rear side of the cockpit, a built-in [[ladder]] provides access to the cockpit, the upper part of the engine nacelles, and the wing.<ref name="Design2" />

===Wings and fuselage===
All versions of the Su-25 have a metal [[Cantilever#In aircraft|cantilever wing]], of [[Swept wing|moderate sweep]] and [[Aspect ratio (wing)|high aspect ratio]], and equipped with high-lift devices. The wing consists of two cantilever sections attached to a central [[torsion box]], forming a single unit with the fuselage. The air brakes are housed in separate [[Aircraft fairing|fairings]] at the tip of each wing. Each wing has five hardpoints for weapons carriage, with the attachment points mounted on [[load-bearing]] ribs and spars.<ref>Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.77.</ref>  Each wing also features a five-section leading-edge [[Slats|slat]], a two-section [[flap]], and an [[aileron]]. 

[[Image:RusSu-25.jpg|thumb|right|Russian Su-25 in flight showing its underside]]

The flaps are mounted by steel sliders and rollers, attached to brackets on the rear spar. The trapezoidal ailerons are located near the [[wingtip]]s.<ref name="Variants5">Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.79-82.</ref> The [[fuselage]] of the Su-25 has an [[ellipsoidal]] section and is of semi-[[monocoque]], [[stressed-skin]] construction, arranged as a longitudinal load-bearing [[framework]] of [[longeron]]s, beams and stringers, with a transverse load-bearing assembly of frames.<ref name="Design2" /> The one-piece horizontal [[tailplane]] is attached to the load-bearing frame at two mounting points.<ref name="Variants5" />

===Power plant===
Early versions of the Su-25 were equipped with two [[R95Sh]] non-afterburning [[turbojet]]s, in separate compartments on either side of the rear fuselage. The engines, sub-assemblies, and surrounding fuselage structure are cooled by air provided by the [[cold air intake]]s located on top of the engine's nacelles. A [[drainage system]] collects oil, [[hydraulic fluid]] residues, and fuel from the engines after flight or after an unsuccessful start. The engine control systems allows independent operation of each engine.<ref name="Variants5" />  The latest versions (Su-25T and TM) are equipped with improved R-195 engines.<ref>Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.111.</ref>

===Avionics===
[[Image:Su-25 Nose view - Le Bourget.JPEG|thumb|right|Nose view of the Su-25]]

The [[avionics]] system of the Su-25 consists of several components:<ref>Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.84-85.</ref>

* Weapons-aiming system, providing targeting data for [[rocket]], [[bomb]], and cannon attacks on ground targets, as well as targeting of aircraft and helicopters in visual flight conditions;
* [[Navigation]] system, permitting flight in day and night conditions, both in [[Visual meteorological conditions|VMC]] and [[Instrument meteorological conditions|IMC]], and providing flight data for the weapons-control system and flight instruments
* Radio for air-to-ground and air-to-air communications
* Weapons-control system
* Self-defence suite, incorporating [[infra-red]], [[flare]] and [[Chaff (radar countermeasure)|chaff]] dispensers capable of launching about 250 flares and [[dipole]] chaff, and a [[radar warning receiver]] that can alert the pilot of incoming attacks on the aircraft.

[[Image:Su-25UB2.jpg|thumb|right|Russian Su-25UB.]]
[[Image:Su-25UBK.jpg|thumb|right|Bulgarian Su-25UBK in flight.]]
[[Image:Su-25TM.jpg|thumb|right|Russian Su-25TM.]]

The basic version of the aircraft was produced at Factory 31, at Tbilisi, in the [[Georgian SSR|Soviet Republic of Georgia]]. Between 1978 and 1989, 582 single-seat Su-25s were produced in Georgia, not including aircraft produced under the Su-25K export program. This variant of the aircraft represents the backbone of the [[Russian Air Force]]'s Su-25 fleet, currently the largest in the world.<ref name="Variants">Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.42-46.</ref>

The aircraft experienced a number of accidents in operational service caused by system failures attributed to salvo firing of weapons. In the wake of these incidents, use of its main armament, the 240mm [[S-24]] missile, was prohibited. In its place, the [[FAB-500]] 500kg general-purpose high-explosive bomb became the primary armament.<ref name="Variants" />

====Su-25K==== 
The basic Su-25 model was used as the basis for a commercial export variant, known as the Su-25K ('''''K'''omercheskiy''). This model was also built at Factory 31 in Tbilisi. The aircraft differed from the Soviet Air Force version in certain minor details concerning internal equipment. A total of 180 Su-25K aircraft were built between 1984 and 1989.<ref name="Variants" />

===Su-25UB===
The Su-25UB [[trainer]] ('''''U'''chebno-'''B'''oyevoy'') was drawn up in 1977. The first prototype, called "T-8UB-1", was rolled out in July 1985 and its maiden flight was carried out at the [[Ulan-Ude]] factory airfield on August 12 of that year.<ref name="Variants"/> It was intended for training and evaluation flights of active-duty pilots, and for training pilot cadets at Soviet Air Force [[flying school]]s. 

The performance of the Su-25UB did not differ substantially from that of the single-seater. The navigation, attack, sighting devices and weapons-control systems of the two-seater enabled it to be used for both routine training and weapons-training missions.<ref>Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.50-51.</ref> By the end of 1986, a total of 25 Su-25UBs had been produced at Ulan-Ude, despite the fact that the twin-seater had not yet completed its State trials and therefore had not been officially cleared for service with the Soviet Air Force.<ref>Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.54.</ref>

====Su-25UBK====
From 1986 to 1989, in parallel with the construction of the main Su-25UB combat training variant, the Ulan-Ude plant produced the so-called "commercial" Su-25UBK, intended for export to countries that bought the Su-25K, and with similar modifications to that aircraft.<ref>Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.56.</ref>

====Su-25UTG====
The Su-25UTG ('''''U'''chebno-'''T'''renirovochnyy s '''G'''akom'') is a variant of the Su-25UB designed to train pilots in takeoff and landing on a land-based simulated carrier deck, with a sloping [[ski-jump]] section and arrester wires. The first one flew in September [[1988 in aviation|1988]], and approximately ten were produced.<ref>Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.59.</ref> About half remained in Russian service after 1991, used with Russia's sole [[aircraft carrier]], the [[Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov|''Admiral Kuznetsov'']]. Such a small number of aircraft were insufficient to serve the training needs of Russia's carrier air group, so a number of Su-25UBs were converted into Su-25UTGs, these aircraft being distinguished by the alternative designation Su-25UBP ('''''U'''chebno-'''B'''oyevoy '''P'''alubny'') —the adjective "''palubnyy''" meaning "deck", indicating that these aircraft have a naval function.<ref name="Variants4" /> About ten of these aircraft are currently operational in the [[Russian Navy]] as part of the 279th Naval Aviation Regiment.<ref>[http://www.warfare.ru/?linkid=1611&catid=256 Russian Military Analysis on Su-25], warfare.ru, accessed [[18 June]] [[200]].</ref>

===Su-25BM===
The Su-25BM ('''''B'''uksirovshchik '''M'''isheney'') is a [[target-towing]] variant of the Su-25 whose development began in [[1986 in aviation|1986]]. The prototype, designated "T-8BM1", successfully flew for the first time on [[22 March]] [[1990]], at Tbilisi, and the aircraft was put into production after completion of the test phase.<ref name="Variants4">Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, ''Variants'', p.60-71.</ref>

The Su-25BM target-tower was designed to provide towed target facilities for training ground forces and naval personnel in ground-to-air or naval surface-to-air missile systems. It is powered by an [[R-195]] engine and equipped with an RSDN-10 long-range [[navigation system]], an analogue of the Western [[LORAN]] system.<ref name="Variants4" />

===Su-25T===
[[Image:Su-25SM.jpg|thumb|right|Russian Su-25SM]]

The Su-25T ('''''T'''ankovy'') is a dedicated [[antitank]] version, which has been battle tested with notable success in combat missions over [[Chechnya]].<ref name="Variants7" /> It is a true all-weather attack aircraft capable of night operations. In addition to the full arsenal of weapons of the standard Su-25, the Su-25T can employ the KAB-500Kr [[Precision-guided munition|TV-guided]] bomb and the semi-active [[laser-guided]] Kh-25ML. <ref name="Variants7" />

A second-generation Su-25T, the Su-25TM (also designated '''Su-39'''), has been developed with improved navigation and attack systems, and better survivability. The Russian Air Force has received only a small number of each version so far. However, the improved avionics systems designed for these aircraft have been utilised in the '''Su-25SM''', an interim upgrade for the series-produced Russian Air Force Su-25, resulting in superior survivability and combat capability.<ref name="Variants7">Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.111-126.</ref>

===Su-25KM===
[[Image:Su-25KM.jpg|thumb|right|Georgian Su-25KM "Scorpion".]]
The SU-25KM ('''''K'''ommercheskiy '''M'''odernizirovannyy''), nicknamed "Scorpion", is an Su-25 upgrade programme announced in early 2001 by the original manufacturer, Tbilisi Aerospace Manufacturing in Georgia, in partnership with [[Elbit Systems]] of Israel. The prototype aircraft made its maiden flight on [[18 April]] [[2001]] at Tbilisi in full [[Georgian Air Force]] markings.<ref name="Variants0">Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, ''Latest variants'', p.103-132.</ref>

The aircraft uses a standard Su-25 airframe, enhanced with advanced avionics including a [[glass cockpit]], digital [[map]] generator, [[head-mounted display|helmet-mounted display]], computerised weapons system, complete mission pre-plan capability, and fully redundant backup modes. Performance enhancements include a highly accurate navigation system, pinpoint weapon delivery systems, all-weather and day/night performance, NATO compatibility,  state-of-the art safety and survivability features, and advanced onboard debriefing capabilities complying with international requirements (as described in this [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ1Rj-ytg6c video]).<ref name="Variants0" />

===Su-28===
[[Image:Su-25UT Frogfoot 01.JPEG|thumb|right|Sukhoi Su-28]]

The [[Sukhoi Su-28]] (also designated as '''Su-25UT''' - '''''U'''chebno-'''T'''renirovochnyy'') is an advanced basic jet trainer, built on the basis of the Su-25UB as a private initiative by the Sukhoi Design Bureau. The Su-28 is a light aircraft designed to replace the Czech [[Aero L-39 Albatros]]. Unlike the basic Su-25UB, it lacks a weapons-control system, built-in cannon, weapons hardpoints, and engine armour.<ref>Gordon & Dawes, p.56-57.</ref>

===Other===
* '''Su-25R''' ('''''R'''azvedchik'') – a tactical [[reconnaissance]] variant designed in 1978, but never built.<ref name="Variants6">Gordon and Dawes, p.70-72.</ref>
* '''Su-25U3''' ('''''U'''chebnyy '''3'''-myestny'') – also known as the "Russian [[Troika]]", was a three-seat basic trainer aircraft. The project was suspended in 1991 due to lack of funding.<ref name="Variants6" />
* '''Su-25U''' ('''''U'''chebnyy'') – a trainer variant of Su-25s produced in Georgia between 1996 and 1998. Three aircraft were built in total, all for the Georgian Air Force.<ref name="Variants6" />

==Combat service==
===Soviet war in Afghanistan===
On [[19 July]] [[1981]], the 200th Independent Shturmovaya Air Squadron was assigned to [[Shindand Airbase]] in western [[Afghanistan]], becoming the first Su-25 unit deployed to that country. Its main task was to conduct air strikes against mountain military positions and structures controlled by the Afghan rebels.<ref name="Combatservice">Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, ''Combat service'', p.133-149.</ref>

Over the course of the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]], Su-25s launched a total of 139 guided missiles of all types against [[Mujahideen#Mujahideen of Afghanistan|Mujahideen]] positions. On average, each aircraft performed 360 sorties per year, a total considerably higher than that of any other combat aircraft in Afghanistan. By the end of the war, nearly 50 Su-25s were deployed at Afghan airbases, carrying out a total of 60,000 sorties. Between the first deployment in 1981 and the end of the war in 1989, 21 aircraft were lost in combat operations.<ref name="Combatservice" />

===Iran-Iraq War===
[[Image:Su-25IRAQ.jpg|thumb|right|Iraqi Su-25, destroyed by Coalition forces]]

The Su-25 also saw combat during the [[Iran-Iraq War]] of 1980–89. The first Su-25s were commissioned by the [[Iraqi Air Force]] in 1987 and performed approximately 900 combat sorties throughout the course of the war, carrying out the bulk of Iraqi air attack missions. During the most intense combat of the war, Iraqi Su-25s were each performing up to fifteen sorties per day each. In one recorded incident, an Iraqi Su-25 was shot down by an Iranian [[MIM-23 Hawk|Hawk]] [[surface to air missile]], but the pilot managed to eject. This was the only confirmed successful Iranian attack against an Iraqi Su-25. After the war, [[Saddam Hussein]] decorated all of the Iraqi Air Force's Su-25 pilots with the country's highest [[military decoration]].<ref name="Combatservice" />

===Gulf War===
During the [[Gulf War]] (Operation Desert Storm), the air superiority of the coalition forces was so great that the majority of Iraqi Su-25s did not even manage to get airborne. On [[25 January]] [[1991]], seven Iraqi Air Force Su-25s fled from Iraq and landed on the territory of their former enemy, Iran.<ref>[http://www.janes.com/defence/air_forces/news/jdw/jdw060913_1_n.shtml Iran bolsters Su-25 fleet] Jane's Defence Weekly, 13 September 2006.</ref>

On the evening of [[6 February]] [[1991]], two [[US Air Force]] [[F-15|F-15C Eagle]] fighters of the 53rd Tactical Fighter Squadron, operating out of [[Al Kharj]] Air Base in [[Saudi Arabia]], intercepted a pair of Iraqi [[MiG-21]]s and a pair of Su-25s. All four Iraqi aircraft were shot down, with both Su-25s coming down in the desert not far from the Iraqi border with Iran. This was the Iraqi Su-25's only air combat of the war.<ref name="Combatservice" />

===2001 Macedonia conflict=== 
Su-25s were used by the [[Military of the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian Air Force]] during the [[2001 Macedonia conflict]] against Albanian separatists. Beginning on [[24 June]] [[2001]], the aircraft made multiple attack runs against separatist positions. The most successful operation took place on [[10 August]] [[2001]], in the village of [[Raduša]], when SU-25s attacked Albanian militants who had ambushed and killed sixteen Macedonian soldiers over the previous two days.<ref name="Operators4">Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.100-102.</ref>

===Ivorian-French War=== 
{{main|Ivorian-French War}}

On [[November 6]] [[2004]], At least one Ivorian Sukhoi Su-25 attacked a position of France's Unicorn peacekeeping force in the rebel stronghold of Bouake at 1300 local time, causing 9 deaths and 37 wounded among the French soldiers. Shortly after that the French military attacked the [[Yamoussoukro]] airport destroying the only two Sukhoi Su-25 planes the Ivorian air force had.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3989127.stm "Ivory Coast seethes after attack"], BBC News, [[7 November]] [[2004]].</ref>

;{{AFG}} : Between 1986 and 1990, a number of Su-25s were reportedly handed over by the [[Soviet Union]] to the Afghan government. Depending on the source consulted, the number of Afghan Su-25s varies between twelve and sixty aircraft. The actual number of Afghan Su-25s has never been established, nor has it been verified whether any remain in the [[Afghan Air Force]] service. Since no evidence of Afghan operation of the Su-25 has emerged during recent allied operations, it is likely the "''Frogfoot''" was never actually acquired by the country.<ref name="Operators3" />

;{{ANG}} : An agreement was reached at the beginning of 1988 between the Soviet Union and Angola that arranged for the delivery of a squadron of Su-25s. The Angolan export agreement comprised twelve single-seat Su-25Ks and two Su-25UBKs trainers. Later, these aircraft were augmented by further deliveries comprising at least three two-seater aircraft.<ref name="Operators3" />

;{{ARM}} : Following the break-up of the Soviet Union, Armenia had no Su-25s in its inventory, but following the start of the conflict in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] in 1991–2, the newly independent [[Republic of Armenia]] unofficially acquired a small number of aircraft (11 single-seaters and four Su-25UBs).<ref name="Operators3">Yafim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.89-92</ref><ref name="awst_20070115">"World Military Aircraft Inventory", Aerospace Source Book 2007, ''[[Aviation Week & Space Technology]]'', [[January 15]] [[2007]].</ref>

;{{AZE}} : Like Armenia, Azerbaijan did not inherit any Su-25s after the collapse of the USSR, but a single aircraft was obtained in April 1992 as a consequence of a pilot defecting from the [[Russian Air Force]] base at Sital-Chai. Following the incident, Azerbaijan acquired at least five Su-25s through unofficial channels, and one more aircraft has been obtained as the result of yet another defection, this time from the [[Georgian Air Force]]. Other aircraft are believed to have been acquired later, as a 2001 inventory of Azerbaijan aircraft revealed that the [[Azerbaijan Air Force]] still had three of the type in its inventory, despite the reported loss of four Su-25s in combat operations relating to Nagorno-Karabakh against Armenia.<ref name="Operators3" />

;{{BLR}} : After the break-up of the Soviet Union, Belarus was the second member state of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]], after [[Russia]], to posses a significant number of Su-25s. Currently, seventy Su-25s and six Su-25UBs are reported to be operational and are mostly concentrated at Lida air base.<ref name="Operators2" />

;{{BUL}} : Bulgaria was the second [[Warsaw Pact]] country to obtain the Su-25, acquiring its first examples of both Su-25K and the Su-25UBK in 1985. The aircraft were intended to replace the obsolete [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17F ''Fresco-C'']] which had been the backbone of the [[Bulgarian Air Force]] fighter-bomber fleet for many years. Twenty Su-25Ks and three Su-25UBKs were commissioned and are currently operational at [[Bezmer]] air base.<ref name="Operators2" />

;{{COD}} : In late 1999, the [[Tbilisi]] Aerospace Manufacturing plant signed a contract with the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] for the delivery of ten Su-25Ks to the [[Military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Force Aerienne Congolaise]]. The deal was reported to be valued at 6 million [[US Dollars]], and the first four aircraft were delivered on board an [[An-124]] in November 1999. The remaining six aircraft were delivered in January 2000.<ref name="Operators2" /> One aircraft crashed in December 2006 during a routine flight, while another one crashed on [[30 June]] [[2007]], during a Congolese independence day display.<ref>[http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL30209861.html ''Congolese fighter jet crashes during display''], [[Reuters]], [[30 June]] [[2007]].</ref>

;{{ETH}} : A pair of Su-25Ts and two Su-25UBK combat trainers were delivered to [[Ethiopia]] in the first quarter of 2000. The twin-seaters were withdrawn from [[Russian Air Force]] service and modified in accordance to a special request by the [[Ethiopian Air Force]]. Since acquiring the aircraft, the Ethiopians have used them in combat operations against [[Eritrean]] insurgent groups.<ref name="Operators2">Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, ''Operators'', p.93-96.</ref>

;{{GEO}} : Georgia, which  produced hundreds of [[MiG-21|MiG-21U/UM/US]] "Mongol" trainers and scores of single-seat Su-25s during the Soviet era, was left with virtually no aircraft following the break-up of the Soviet Union. Only a very small number of single-seat Su-25s were actually taken on to the inventory of the newly formed [[Georgian Air Force]], these aircraft having been left in the factory at the time of Georgian independence. Currently Georgia has up to nine Su-25s of various types and eight Su-25KM "''Scorpion''" (an upgraded version of the Su-25 in collaboration with [[Israel]]) at its disposal. <ref>Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.97.</ref>

;{{IRN}} : On [[21 January]] [[1991]], seven [[Iraqi Air Force]] Su-25s were flown to Iran in an effort to find a temporary safe haven from [[Operation Desert Storm]] attacks on major Iraqi airfields. These Iraqi aircraft were considered by the Iranians to be a gift from their former adversary, and were seized by the Iranian military. However, as a result of lack of spare parts, documentation, and pilot training, these aircraft were never flown by the [[Iranian Air Force]]. Iran's [[Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Air Force]] has added at least six new aircraft to its inventory and has since likely restored ex-Iraqi Su-25s to flight status as well.<ref>[http://www.janes.com/defence/air_forces/news/jdw/jdw060913_1_n.shtml Iran bolsters Su-25 fleet] Jane's Defence Weekly, [[13 September]] [[2006]].</ref> 

;{{KAZ}} : The [[Military of Kazakhstan|Kazakh Air Force]] received twelve single-seat Su-25s and two Su-25UB trainers in December 1995 as compensatory payment for the return of the [[Tu-95|Tu-95MS "''Bear-H''"]] strategic bombers which had been rapidly flown out of the republic at the time of the collapse of the USSR. The Kazakh Su-25s are located at [[Chimkent]] air base in the south of the country.<ref name="Operators2" />

;{{PRK}} : North Korea was the first [[Asia|Asian country]] to obtain the Su-25. In the 1950s, the [[North Korean Air Force]] had accumulated useful experience of operating the Su-25's piston-engined predecessor, the [[Ilyushin Il-10|Ilyushin Il-10 "''Beast''"]]. In the period from the end of 1987 until 1989, the DPRK acquired a total of thirty-two single-seat Su-25Ks and four Su-25UBKs. The aircraft are based at [[Sonchon]] air base (80 km from [[Pyongyang]]), which features heavily-fortified natural hangars equipped with blast-proof doors capable of protecting the aircraft from conventional and [[nuclear explosion]]s.<ref name="Operators4" />

[[Image:PeruSu-25.jpg|thumb|right|The Peruvian Su-25s in line]]

;{{PER}} : Peru received eighteen Su-25s in late 1998 from Belarus, which refurbished them prior to delivery. The shipment comprised ten single-seat and eight dual-seat Su-25UB trainers. The aircraft were all built just before the collapse of the Soviet Union and thus represented the final versions of the Soviet Su-25. It is believed that between 1998 and December 2005, at least twenty-five light aircraft transporting [[cocaine]] had been shot down by the Peruvian Su-25s.<ref name="Operators4" />

[[Image:Su-25Rus.jpg|thumb|right|Russian Air Force Su-25 in specific markings.]]

;{{RUS}} : Today, Russia possesses a reduced fleet of Su-25s, which are operated by "Shturmovoi" Assault Regiments. The major variants used are the single-seat Su-25, the twin-seat Su-25UB, and the Su-25BM target-towing version. In addition, the [[Russian Air Force]] received a small number of Su-25T anti-tank variants, which have been tested with notable success under combat conditions in [[Chechnya]]. The Su-25 is also operated by the [[Russian Navy]], both in standard land-based Su-25 and Su-25UB guise, as well as in the specialised Su-25UTG role as a carrier-operable trainer. Overall, 241 Su-25s are currently in service with the Russian Air Force, including 10 being operated by the navy.[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/av-main.htm] A modernisation program of single-seat Su-25s to the Su-25SM variant is underway.<ref name="Operators4" /> The first modernised Su-25SM was delivered in August 2001, while another six were delivered in late December 2006 at [[Lipetsk]] air base. <ref>[[Air Forces Monthly]], July 2007 edition.</ref>

;{{SVK}} : The [[Slovak Air Force]] received twelve Su-25Ks and one Su-25UBK following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. The aircraft are currently based at the Slovak 33rd Air Base in Malacky-Kuchyna. <ref name="Operators2" /> 

;{{TKM}} : Following the downfall of the Soviet Union, the newly independent Republic of Turkmenistan was given 46 Su-25s which had been disassembled for storage in Turkmenistan at that time. In accordance with an agreement between Georgia and Turkmenistan in 1999, the Tbilisi Aerospace Manufacturing corporation refurbished 45 of these aircraft for use by the [[Military of Turkmenistan|Turkmenistan Air Force]] as payment for the delivery of [[natural gas]]. The refurbished aircraft were relocated at Ak-Tepe air base, and currently a total of eighteen operational Su-25s are known to be based there.<ref name="Operators4" />

[[Image:Ukr af su25.jpg|thumb|right|Ukrainian [[Su-25]]]]

;{{UKR}} : Ukraine obtained 92 Su-25s of differing variants following the country's independence in the wake of the break-up of the USSR. Currently, the [[Ukrainian Air Force]] operates approximately 60 Su-25, Su25UBs, and Su-25UTGs, which are operated by the 299th Independent Assault Regiment (299 OShAP), based at [[Saki]] in the [[Crimea]], and the 456th Assault Regiment (456 ShAP) at [[Chortkiv]]. Up to 30 Su-25 are reportedly stored at the 4070th Reserve Base. Evidently, three Su-25s sold to Macedonia came from this reserve pool.<ref name="Operators4" />

;{{UZB}} : Until 1990, a [[Soviet Air Force]] pilot training centre equipped with around 20 Su-25, Su-25UB, and Su-25BM variants was located at [[Chirchik]] air base in Uzbekistan. In 1991, a small number of Su-25s were also located at [[Dzhizak]] air base, but after 1991, all Su-25s in Uzbekistan were concentrated at Chirchik, operated by the 59th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment (59 APIB) of the Soviet Air Force. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, all the Su-25s on the territory of the now independent republic became the property of the new government.<ref name="Operators4" />

;{{CZS}} : Passed aircraft onto successor states, in the ratio of 2:1 in favour of the [[Czech Republic]].<ref name="Operators2" />

;{{CZE}} : After the dissolution of [[Czechoslovakia]], the Czech Republic acquired twenty-four Su-25Ks and one Su-25UBK. In December 2000, the Czech Su-25s were retired from service and placed in storage at [[Přerov]] air base.<ref>[http://www.scramble.nl/cz.htm Info about Czech air force], Scramble.nl.</ref>

[[Image:MacSu-25.jpg|thumb|right|Rare image of a Macedonian Su-25K]]
;{{MKD}} : Republic of Macedonia purchased three single-seat Su-25s and one Su-25UB following [[2001 Macedonia conflict|incursions and attacks]] by [[Albanians|Albanian]] separatists. The aircraft were supplied by [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] authorities after having been withdrawn from [[Ukrainian Air Force]] service.<ref>Yafim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.99.</ref> The aircraft were retired in 2004 and later sold to Georgia in 2005.<ref>[http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/fyrm/su25.htm#su-25 Information on FYROM Su-25s.]</ref>

;{{IRQ}} : During the course of the early phase of the Iran-Iraq War, Iraq approached the Soviet Union with a request to purchase a wide variety of military equipment. As a result, Iraq become the first non-Warsaw Pact country to obtain the Su-25K and Su-25UBK combat trainer. It is believed that Iraq received a total of 73 Su-25s, of which four were the Su-25UBK trainer. In January 1998, the Iraqi Air Force still possessed twelve Su-25s, and at least three Su-25Ks were seen in a demonstration over [[Baghdad]] in December 2002. However, the remaining Su-25s were phased out immediately after the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]].<ref name="Operators2" />
