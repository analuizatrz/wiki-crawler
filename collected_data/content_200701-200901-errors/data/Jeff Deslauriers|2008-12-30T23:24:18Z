'''Jeff Drouin-Deslauriers''' (born May 15, 1984 in [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec|Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu]], [[Quebec]]) is a professional [[ice hockey]] [[goaltender]] who currently plays for the [[Springfield Falcons]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL). He is a prospect for the [[Edmonton Oilers]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). He was selected by the Oilers in the second round of the [[2002 NHL Entry Draft]] with the 31st overall pick.

Deslauriers was selected from Chicoutimi of the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League|QMJHL]], where he was the starting goaltender for three seasons.  He was twice the runner up for the backup job on [[Canada]]'s [[World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|World Junior Championship]] team.

The 2004-05 season was Deslauriers' first professional experience.  He split time between the [[Edmonton Road Runners]] of the [[American Hockey League|AHL]] and the [[Greenville Grrrowl]] of the [[East Coast Hockey League|ECHL]].  It was not a good season for Deslauriers, as he fought injury problems, and played for an AHL team that failed to make the playoffs.

In the 2005-06 season, due to the Oilers not having a farm team, Deslauriers only played 13 games and struggled, before being sent down once again to the Grrrowl.

The 2006-07 season was a turnaround, however. Deslauriers was back in the AHL with the [[Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins]], and eventually became the team's starting goaltender. He played well, and ranked among the top goaltenders in the league.

On October 17, 2008, Deslauriers earned his first NHL win in a 4-3 victory over the [[Calgary Flames]].
