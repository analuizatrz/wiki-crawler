'''''The Nightmare''''' is a [[1781 in art|1781]] painting by [[Henry Fuseli]] (1741–1825).  It is  Fuseli's best-known work and is among the most famous images of its age.  

== Description ==

The painting portrays a sleeping woman draped over the end of a bed, surmounted by an [[incubus]] that peers out at the viewer. A horse's head, with blind, undefined eyes, appears at left. The space's interior is contemporary, including a small table on the left, and a stool partially hidden by blankets. The scene's [[chiaroscuro]] lighting creates strong contrasts.  The sleeper seems lifeless, and her coloration sets her apart from the darker reds, yellows, and [[ochre]]s. Art critic Nicholas Powell finds that the woman's pose derives from the [[Vatican Museums|Vatican]] ''Ariadne''{{cref|a}} and the style of the incubus from [[commons:Selinunte figures|figures at Selinunte]], an archaeological site in [[Sicily]].<ref name="russo">Russo, Kathleen (1990).

== History == 

The painting was first shown at the [[Royal Academy of London]] in 1782; it became so popular that Fuseli painted other versions with the same theme. Fuseli sold the original for twenty [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]]s,and an [[engraving]]{{cref|b}} by [[Thomas Burke (artist)|Thomas Burke]] circulated widely, earning publisher [[John Raphael Smith]] more than 500 pounds.<ref name="knowles"/> Once the painting became popular, engraved versions were underscored by a portion of [[Erasmus Darwin]]'s ''[[The Loves of the Plants]]'':

<poem>
       So on his NIGHTMARE, through the evening fog,
     Flits the squab fiend o'er fen, and lake, and bog;
     Seeks some love-wilder'd maid with sleep oppress'd
     Alights, and grinning sits upon her breast —
       Such as of late, amid the murky sky,
     Was marked by FUSELI'S poetic eye;
     Whose daring tints, with Shakspeare's happiest grace,
     Gave to the airy phantom form and place —
     Back o'er her pillow sinks her blushing head,
     Her snow-white limbs hang helpless from the bed;
     While with quick sighs and suffocative breath,
     Her interrupted heart-pulse swims in death.<ref name="knowles">{{cite book|author=Knowles, John|title=The Life and Writings of Henry Fuseli, Vol. 1|year=1831|publisher=H. Colburn and R. Bentley|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Av41AAAAMAAJ|pages=64–65}}</ref>
</poem>

The painting and poem invoked, for contemporary viewers, the relationship of the horse to [[nightmare]]s  ("night [[mare (horse)|mare]]"). The etymology of the word "nightmare", however, is not related to horses. Rather, it is derived from ''[[mara (folklore)|mara]]'', a mythological term referring to a spirit sent to torment sleepers.

Contemporary critics often found the work scandalous, due to its sexual themes. A few years before he painted ''The Nightmare'', Fuseli had fallen passionately in love with one Anna Landholdt, the niece of Swiss physiognomist [[Johann Kaspar Lavater]], his friend. His love was unrequited; Landholdt married a family friend shortly after meeting him. H. W. Jansen suggests that the sleeping woman represents Landholdt and that the demon is Fuseli himself.  There is an unfinished portrait of a girl on the back of the painting's canvas, which may be the same woman. Marcia Allentuck, author of ''Women as Sex Objects'' (1972), argues that the painting's intent is to show female orgasm. This is supported by Fuseli's more private drawings that are sexually overt and even pornographic (e.g., ''Symplegma of Man with Two Women'', 1770–78). 

Four versions of Fuseli's ''Nightmare'' survive. The other important canvas was painted in 1802 and is held in Frankfurt. It is smaller than the original, and the woman's head lies to the left; a mirror opposes her on the right. The demon is looking at the woman rather than out of the picture, and has pointed, catlike ears.  The most significant difference in the remaining two versions is an erotic statuette of a couple on the table.<ref name="murray"/> 

== Analysis == 

Sleep and dreams were common subjects for Fuseli. His first known painting is ''Joseph Interpreting the Dreams of the Butler and Baker of Pharaoh'' (1768), and later he produced ''[[commons:Image:Johann Heinrich Füssli 017.jpg|The Shepherd's Dream]]'' (1798) inspired by [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', and ''Richard III Visited by Ghosts'' (1798) based on [[Richard III (play)|Shakespeare's play]]. 

''The Nightmare'' is unique, however, in its lack of reference to literary or religious themes (Fuseli was an ordained minister), being based instead on [[folklore]] and on the [[Frankenstein#Shelley's inspiration|waking dream]]s experienced by his contemporaries and himself. The work was likely inspired by tales about demons and witches posessing people who slept alone. In these stories, men were visited by horses or [[hag]]s, giving rise to the terms "hag-riding" and "mare-riding". Women were believed to engage in sex with the devil. The painting incorporates both of these ideas, depicting a horse's head and a demon crouched on top of the woman. The horse, though, may have been an afterthought, since an early sketch by Fuseli did not include it. 

== Legacy ==

''The Nightmare'' was widely plagiarized, and parodies of it were commonly used for political [[caricature]], by [[George Cruikshank]] and others. In these scenes, the incubus afflicts subjects such as [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], [[Louis XVIII]], British politician [[Charles James Fox]], and Prime Minister [[William Pitt]]. In another example, admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]] is the demon, and his mistress [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]], the sleeper.<ref name="murray">{{cite book|author=Murray, Christopher John|title=Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760-1850|year=2004|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=1579584233|pages=810–11}}</ref>

Max Eastman]] visited [[Sigmund Freud]]'s apartment in [[Vienna]], in 1926, and claimed to have seen displayed a print of [[Fuseli]]'s ''The Nightmare'', next to [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]]'s ''The Anatomy Lesson''. [[Ernest Jones]] chose another version of Fuseli's painting as the frontispiece of his book ''On the Nightmare'', however neither Freud nor Jones mentioned those paintings in their writings about dreams.
