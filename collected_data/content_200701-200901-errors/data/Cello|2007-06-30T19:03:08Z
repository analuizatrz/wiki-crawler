The '''violoncello,''' almost always abbreviated to '''cello''', or ''''cello''' (the ''c'' is pronounced {{IPA|[tʃ]}} as the ''ch'' in "cheese"), is a bowed [[stringed instrument]], the lowest-sounding member of the [[violin family]]. A person who plays a cello is called a  [[cellist]]. The cello is used as a solo instrument, in [[chamber music]], and as a member of the string section of an orchestra.

== Description ==
[[Image:Brikcius.jpg|thumb|Cellist]]
The name ''cello'' (plural: ''cellos'' or ''celli'') is an abbreviation of the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''violoncello'', which means "little violone". The ''[[violone]]'' is a large [[viol]], similar to a modern [[double bass]].

The cello is most closely associated with [[European classical music]]. It is part of the standard [[orchestra]] and is the bass voice of the [[string quartet]], as well as being part of many other [[chamber music|chamber]] groups. A large number of [[cello concerto|concertos]] and [[cello sonata|sonatas]] have been written for it. It is less common in [[popular music]], but is sometimes featured in [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music|rock]] recordings. The cello has also been modified for [[Indian classical music]] by [[Saskia Rao-de Haas]].

Among the most famous [[Baroque]] works for the cello are [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach's]] ''[[Cello Suites (Bach)|Unaccompanied Suites for Cello]],'' commonly known as the Bach Cello Suites. An example of a [[Classical music era|Classical era]] piece is [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn's]] ''[[Cello Concerto No. 1 in C (Haydn)|Cello Concerto #1 in C major]]''. Standard [[Romantic music era|Romantic era]] repertoire includes the ''[[Cello Concerto in B minor]]'' by [[Antonín Dvořák]], [[Sir Edward Elgar|Elgar's]] ''[[Cello Concerto (Elgar)|Cello Concerto in E minor]]'', and the two sonatas by [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]. Modern compositions from the early 20th century include unaccompanied cello sonatas by [[Paul Hindemith]] ([[opus number|opus]] 25) and [[Zoltán Kodály]] (opus 8). Recordings within the [[Avant Garde]] (cutting edge) genre have revitalized the instrument's perceived versatility. One example is ''Night of the Four Moons'' by [[George Crumb]].

==Sound==
The cello produces a deep and rich sound. The cello reaches the lowest pitch in the traditional [[string quartet]] and is capable of covering the entire range of pitches produced by the human voice. In the upper register, many celli may be said to have a "tenor-like" timbre.

The lowest possible pitch is C2, two octaves below middle C. The highest pitch (without considering harmonics) on the fingerboard is somewhere around F#6, played on the A string, but Zoltán Kodaly's solo sonata requires a spectacular B6 to be played in the concluding measures.

==Tuning and range==
[[Image:Cello_open_strings.png|left|thumb|250px|The pitch of the cello's open strings.]]
The cello has four [[Vibrating string|strings]] referred to by their standard tuning, which is in [[perfect fifth]] intervals: the A-string (highest sounding), D-string, G-string, and C-string (lowest sounding). The A-string is tuned to the pitch A3 (below [[middle C]]), the D-string a fifth lower at D3, the G-string a fifth below that at G2, and the C-string tuned to C2 (two [[octave]]s lower than [[middle C]]). Some pieces, notably the 5th of Bach's ''[[Cello Suites (Bach)|6 Suites for Unaccompanied Cello]]'', require an altered tuning of the strings (C-G-d-g), known as [[scordatura]]; another well-known example is [[Zoltán Kodály]]'s Solo Cello Sonata (B-F#-d-a). Many believe that the 6th of Bach's ''[[Cello Suites (Bach)|6 Suites for Unaccompanied Cello]]'' was actually written for a five string "[[violoncello piccolo]]", a smaller cello with a high E-string above the A-string, that is no longer commonly used. 

While the lower range of the cello is limited by the tuning of the lowest string (typically C2, two octaves below [[middle C]]), the upper range of the cello varies according to the skill of the player, and length of the fingerboard. A general guideline when writing for professional cellists sets the upper limit at C6 (two octaves above middle C), although even higher pitches are possible, up to one extra octave. Because of the extended range of the instrument, music for the cello frequently alternates between the bass [[clef]], tenor clef, and treble clef.

The strings are tuned one octave lower than the viola, and one octave plus one fifth lower than the violin

Composers up to [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]] followed the older convention of writing in [[treble clef]] with the note sounding an octave lower than written; if, however, the treble clef follows tenor clef instead of bass clef, it is played as written. A late example of this usage is the arrangement attributed to [[Hans Eisler]] of the Serenade from [[Schoenberg]]'s Septet op. 24.

==Construction==
[[Image:Violincello anotations.JPG|right|thumb|450px|The construction of a cello]]
The cello is larger than the [[violin]] or the [[viola]] but smaller than the [[double bass]]. Like the other members of the [[violin family]], the cello usually has four strings, although five and even six string cellos are occasionally seen. The cello is played in an upright position, held by the knees of a seated musician, resting on a spike called the [[endpin]]. The player draws the [[bow (music)|bow]] horizontally across the strings.

The cello is a complex instrument consisting of many different parts. Although the majority of it is composed of [[wood]], some parts can be made of [[steel]] or other metals or a [[composite material]].
===Body===
The main frame of the cello is typically made from wood, although some modern celli are constructed from [[carbon fiber]], given the strength of the material and its resistance to humidity and temperature fluctuations. Carbon fiber cellos are particularly suitable for outdoor playing.

A traditional cello normally has a [[spruce]] top, with [[maple]] for the back, sides, and neck. Other woods, such as [[poplar]] or [[willow]], are sometimes used for the back and sides. Less expensive celli frequently have a top and back made of a [[Plywood|laminate]]. 

The top and back are traditionally hand-carved, though less expensive celli are often machine-produced. The sides, or ribs, are made by heating the wood and bending it around forms. The cello body has a wide top bout, narrow middle formed by two C-bouts, and wide bottom bout, with the [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]] and [[sound hole]]s just below the middle.

The top and back of the cello has decorative border inlay known as [[purfling]].

===Neck, pegbox, and scroll===
Above the main body is the carved neck, which leads to a [[pegbox]] and the [[scroll (music)|scroll]]. The neck, pegbox, and scroll are normally carved out of a single piece of wood. Attached to the neck and extending over the body of the instrument is the fingerboard. The [[Nut (instrumental)|nut]] is a raised piece of wood, where the fingerboard meets the pegbox, which the strings rest on. The pegbox houses four [[tuning peg]]s, one for each string. The pegs are used to tune the cello by either tightening or loosening the string. The scroll is a traditional part of the cello and all other members of the [[violin family]]. [[Ebony]] is usually used for the tuning pegs, fingerboard, and nut, but other hard woods, such as [[boxwood]] or [[rosewood]], can be used.

===Tailpiece and endpin===
The [[tailpiece]] and endpin are found in the lower part of the cello. The tailpiece is traditionally made of [[ebony]] or another hard wood, but can also be made of [[plastic]] or [[steel]]. It attaches the strings to the lower end of the cello, and can have one or more [[fine tuner]]s. The endpin, made of metal or carbon fiber, supports the cello in playing position. Modern endpins are retractable and adjustable; older ones were made of wood and could be removed when not in use. The tip of the endpin is sometimes capped with a rubber tip that prevents the cello from slipping on the floor.

===Bridge and f-holes===

[[Image:Cello bridge.jpg|right|thumb|The bridge of a cello, with a mute]]

The [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]] elevates the strings above the cello and transfers their vibrations to the top of the instrument and the soundpost inside (see below). The bridge is not glued, but rather held in place by the tension of the strings. The [[sound-hole|f-hole]]s (named for their shape) are located on either side of the bridge, and allow air to move in and out of the instrument to produce sound. Additionally, the f-holes act as access points to the interior of the cello for repairs or maintenance. Sometimes a small hose called a [[Dampit]], containing a water-soaked sponge, is inserted through the f-holes, and serves as a humidifier.

===Internal features===
Internally, the cello has two important features: a [[bass bar]], which is glued to the underside of the top of the instrument, and a round wooden [[sound post]], which is wedged between the top and bottom plates. The bass bar, found under the bass foot of the bridge, serves to support the cello's top and distribute the vibrations. The sound post, found under the treble side of the bridge, connects the back and front of the cello. Like the bridge, the sound post is not glued, but is kept in place by the tensions of the bridge and strings. Together, the bass bar and sound post are responsible for transferring the strings' vibrations to the body of the instrument, which in turn transfers them to the air mass inside the instrument, thus producing sound.

===Glue===
Cellos are constructed and repaired using [[Animal glue|hide glue]], which is strong but reversible, allowing for disassembly when needed. Tops may be glued on with diluted glue, since some repairs call for the removal of the top. Theoretically, hide glue is weaker than the body's wood, so as the top or back shrinks side-to-side, the glue holding it will let go, avoiding a crack in the plate. However, in reality this does not always happen.

===Bow===
[[Image:Bow hand Violoncello.jpg|thumb|right|130px|A cello bow.]]
Traditionally, [[bow (music)|bow sticks]] are made from pernambuco (high quality) or [[brazilwood]] (lower quality). Both woods come from the same species of tree ([[Brazilwood|Caesalpina echinata]]), but pernambuco is the heartwood of the tree and is much darker (brazilwood is sometimes stained a dark color to compensate). Pernambuco is a heavy, resinous wood with great elasticity and high sound velocity which makes it an ideal wood for instrument bows. 

Bow sticks can also be made from carbon-fiber, which is stronger than wood. Inexpensive, low-quality student bows are often made from fiberglass.

The bow hair is [[horsehair]], though synthetic hair in different colors is also available. The hair is coated with [[rosin]] periodically to make it grip the strings and cause them to vibrate. Bows need to be re-haired periodically, especially if the hairs break frequently or lose their gripping quality. The hair is kept under tension while playing by a screw which pulls the frog (the part of the bow one holds) back. Leaving the bow tightened for long periods of time can damage it by warping the stick. The dimensions of the cello bow are 73 cm long, 3 cm high (from the frog to the stick) and 1.5 cm wide.

==Development==
The cello developed from the bass violin, first used by [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]], which was a three-string consort instrument. The invention of wire-wound [[strings (music)|strings]] (fine wire around a thin gut core), around 1660 in [[Bologna]], allowed for a finer bass sound than was possible with purely gut strings on such a short body. Bolognese makers exploited this new technology to create the cello, a somewhat smaller instrument suitable for solo repertoire due to both the timbre of the instrument and the fact that the smaller size made it easier to play [[virtuoso|virtuosic]] passages. This instrument had disadvantages as well, however. The cello's light sound was not as suitable for church and ensemble playing, so it had to be doubled by [[double bass|basses]] or [[violone]]s. 

Around 1700, Italian players popularized the cello in northern Europe, although the bass violin continued to be used for another two decades in France and England. The sizes, names, and tunings of the cello varied widely by geography and time. The size was not standardized until around 1750.

Despite superficial similarities, the cello is not in fact related to the [[viol|viola da gamba]]. The cello is actually part of the [[viola da braccio]] family, meaning viol of the arm, which includes, among others, the [[violin]] and [[viola]]. There are actually paintings of people playing the cello on the shoulder, like a giant violin. It was only somewhat later that the cello began to be played while being supported by the calves, and even later, by an endpin (spike). 

[[Baroque]] era cellos differed from the modern instrument in several ways. The neck has a different form and angle which matches the baroque bass-bar and stringing. Modern cellos have an endpin at the bottom to support the instrument (and transmit some of the sound through the floor), while Baroque cellos are held only by the calves of the player. Modern bows curve in and are held at the frog; Baroque bows curve out and are held closer to the bow's point of balance. Modern strings normally have a metal core, although some use a synthetic core; Baroque strings are made of [[Catgut|gut]], with the G and C strings wire-wound. Modern cellos often have fine-tuners connecting the strings to the tailpiece, which make it much easier to tune the instrument. Overall, the modern instrument has much higher string tension than the Baroque cello, resulting in a louder, more projecting tone, with fewer overtones.

No educational works specifically devoted to the cello existed before the 18th century, and those that do exist contain little value to the performer beyond simple accounts of instrumental technique. The earliest cello manual is [[Michel Corrette]]'s ''Méthode, thèorique et pratique pour apprendre en peu de temps le violoncelle dans sa perfection'' (Paris, 1741).

==Playing technique==
===Body position===
The cello is played sitting, held between the knees of the player, the upper bout resting against the upper chest. The neck of the cello is above the player's left shoulder. In early times, female cellists sometimes played side-saddle, since it was considered improper for a lady to part her knees in public.

In all cases, [[left-handed]] individuals play the cello in the same position as a [[right-handed]] individual.

===Left hand technique===
The position of the left hand fingers along the strings determine the pitch of the note. The thumb is positioned on the back of the neck (in "neck" positions), or on top of the string, alongside the fingers (in "thumb" position). The fingers are normally held curved with each knuckle bent, unless certain intervals require flat fingers (as in fifths). In fast playing, the fingers tips contact the strings, almost at the nail. In slower, or more expressive playing, the flat of the fingerpad is used, allowing a richer tone and fuller vibrato. If the string is depressed closer to the bridge, the resulting pitch will be higher sounding because the vibrating string length has been shortened. If it is depressed farther up the string, closer to the scroll of the instrument, the pitch will be lower.

=====Vibrato=====
[[Vibrato]] consists of oscillating the playing left hand finger around the center of the desired pitch. As a result, the pitch of the note will waver slightly, similar to a singer's voice on a sustained note sung with vibrato. Vibrato is a key expressive device, and a well-developed vibrato technique is an essential element of a cellist's skill. In some styles of music, such as that of the [[Romantic Music|Romantic]] period, vibrato may be used on almost every note. However, in other styles, such as [[Baroque]] repertoire, vibrato is used only rarely, as an ornament. In any case, the choice of whether to use vibrato, and how much, is a stylistic decision on the part of the player. Typically, the lower the pitch of the note played, the wider and slower the vibrato. Conversely, higher notes generally get less, and faster, vibrato.

=====Glissando=====
[[Glissando]] ("sliding", in Italian) is an effect played by sliding the finger up or down the fingerboard without releasing the string. This causes the pitch to rise and fall smoothly, without separate, discernible steps.

=====Harmonics=====
[[Harmonics]] are produced by lightly touching, but not fully depressing, the string with the finger at certain places, and then bowing (rarely even plucking) the string. For example, the halfway point of the string will produce a harmonic that is one octave above the unfingered (open) string (in effect doubling the frequency of the open string). There are also artificial harmonics, in which the player depresses the string with one finger while touching the same string lightly with another finger (at certain intervals, mostly of a perfect fourth higher). This technique produces a distinctive sound effect, resembling the flute. Artificial harmonics are performed routinely with the thumb (pressed fully) and the third finger (lightly touching the same string, a fourth higher).

=====Barring=====
Barring is where a player holds a finger down on two or more strings to sound the interval of a fifth, or to switch rapidly between two related "bare fifth" or "power" chords.

===Right hand technique===
In cello playing, the bow is much like the breath of a [[wind instrument]] player. Arguably, it is the major determinant in the expressiveness of the playing. The right hand holds the bow and controls the duration and character of the notes. The bow is drawn across the strings roughly halfway between the end of the [[fingerboard]] and the bridge, in a direction perpendicular to the strings. The bow is held with all five fingers of the right hand, the thumb opposite the fingers and closer to the cellist's body. The shape of the hand should resemble that of its relaxed state, with all fingers curved, including the thumb. The transmission of weight from the arm to the bow happens through the [[pronation]] (inward rotation) of the underarm, thus pushing the index finger and to a lesser degree the middle finger onto the bow. The necessary counterforce is provided by the thumb. The little finger controls  the angle to the string and the balance of the bow when it is lifted off the string (''see'' [[spiccato]]). The shoulder remains relaxed, as well as the arm. 
On a "down-bow", the bow is drawn to the right of the player, moving the hand by first using the upper arm, then the forearm, then the wrist (turning slightly inward) in order to maintain a straight stroke. On an "up-bow", the bow is drawn to the left, moving first the forearm, then the upper arm, then the wrist (pushing slightly upward). The bow is mostly used perpendicular to the string being played. In order to perform string changes the whole arm is either lowered or lifted, with as little wrist movement as possible in order to maintain the angle to the string. However, a certain flexibility of the wrist is necessary when changing the bow direction from up-bow to down-bow and vice versa. For very fast bow movements, the wrist is used to accomplish the horizontal movement of bow. For longer strokes, the arm is used as well as the wrist. 

Tone production and volume of sound depend on a combination of several factors. The three most important ones are: bow speed, weight applied to the string, and point of contact of the bow hair with the string. A good player will be capable of a very even tone, and will counter the natural tendency to play with the most force with the part of the bow nearest to the frog or heel, and the least force near the tip. The closer to the bridge the string is bowed, the more projecting and brighter the tone, with the extreme (''sul ponticello'') producing a metallic, shimmery sound. If bowing closer to the fingerboard (''sul tasto''), the sound produced will be softer, more mellow, and less defined.

====Additional right hand techniques====
=====Double stops=====
[[Double stop]]s involve the playing of two notes at the same time. Two strings are fingered simultaneously, and the bow is drawn so as to sound them both at once. Triple and quadruple stops may also be played (in a "broken" fashion), but are difficult to sustain because of the change in slope of the bridge. One contemporary cellist, [[Frances-Marie Uitti]], has come up with a two-bow system with one bow above the strings and one under, allowing for sustained triple and quadruple stops.
=====Pizzicato=====
In [[pizzicato]] playing, the string is plucked with the right hand fingers,and the bow is simply held away from the strings by the rest of the hand or even set down. A single string can be played ''pizzicato,'' or double, triple, or quadruple stops can be played. Occasionally, a player must bow one string with the right hand and simultaneously pluck another with the left. This is marked by a "+" above the note. Strumming of chords is also possible, in guitar fashion.

=====Col legno=====
[[Col legno]] is the technique in which the player taps the wooden stick of the bow on the strings, which gives a percussive sound that is quite often used in contemporary music. A famous example is the opening of 'Mars' from Gustav Holst's 'Planets' suite, where the entire string section of the orchestra plays ''Col legno''.

=====Spiccato=====
In [[spiccato]], or "bouncy bow" playing, the strings are not "drawn" by the bow but struck by it, while still retaining some horizontal motion, to generate a more percussive, crisp sound. It may be performed by using the wrist to "dip" the bow into the strings. Spiccato is usually associated with lively playing. On a violin, ''spiccato'' bowing comes off the string, but on a cello, the wood of the bow may rise briskly up without the hair actually leaving the string.
=====Staccato=====
In [[staccato]], the player moves the bow a very short distance, and applies greater pressure to create a forced sound.
=====Legato=====
[[Legato]] is a technique where the notes are drawn out and connected for a smooth sounding piece.
The most important thing is to use your wrist more, not your arm.

==Sizes==
Standard-sized cellos are referred to as "full-size". However, celli come in smaller (fractional) sizes, from "seven-eighths" and "three-quarter" down to "one-sixteenth" sized cellos (e.g. 7/8, 3/4, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/10, 1/16). The smaller-sized celli are identical to standard cellos in construction, range, and usage, but are simply 'scaled-down' for the benefit of children and shorter adults. A "half-size" cello is not actually half the size of a "full-size", but only slightly smaller. Many smaller cellists prefer to play a "seven-eighths" cello as the hand stretches in the lower positions are less demanding. Although rare, cellos in sizes larger than four-fourths do exist. Cellists with unusually large hands may play a slightly larger than full-sized cello. Cellos made before approximately 1700 tended to be considerably larger than those made after that date, and than those made and commonly played today. Around 1680, string-making technology made lower pitches on shorter strings possible. The cellos of Stradivari, for example, can be clearly divided into two models, with the style made before 1702 characterized by larger instruments (of which only three examples are extant in their original size and configuration), and the style made during and after 1702, when Stradivari, presumably in response to the "new" type of strings, began making cellos of a smaller size. This later model is the one most commonly used by modern luthiers. 

==Accessories==
There are many accessories to the cello, (some more essential than others).
*[[Case]]s are used to protect the cello and bow when traveling, and for safe storage.
*[[Rosin]], made from [[Pinophyta|conifer]] [[resin]], is applied to the bow hairs to increase the effectiveness of the friction and allow proper sound production.
*[[Endpin]] stops or straps (tradenames including Rockstop and Black Hole) keep the cello from sliding if the endpin does not have a rubber piece on the end (used on wood floors).
*[[Wolf tone eliminator]]s are sometimes placed on cello strings between the tailpiece and the bridge in order to eliminate acoustic anomalies known as [[wolf tone]]s or "wolfs".
*[[Mute (music)|Mutes]] are used to change the sound of the cello by reducing [[overtones]]. Practice mutes (made of metal) significantly reduce the instrument's volume (they are also referred to as "hotel mutes").
*[[Metronome]]s provide a steady [[tempo]] by sounding out a certain number of beats per minute. Many models can also produce a [[tuning]] pitch of A4 (440 Hz), among others.
*[[Humidifier]]s are used to control and stabilize the humidity around and inside the cello.
*[[Frequency counter|Tuners]] are used to [[tuning|tune]] the instrument.

==Current use==
===Orchestral===
Cellos are part of the standard [[symphony orchestra]]. Usually, the orchestra includes eight to twelve cellists. The cello section, in standard orchestral seating, is located on stage left (the audience's right) in the front, opposite the first violin section. However, some orchestras and conductors prefer switching the positioning of the viola and cello sections. The ''principal'', or "first chair" cellist is the section leader, determining bowings for the section in conjunction with other string principals, and playing solos. Principal players always sit closest to the audience.

The cellos are a critical part of orchestral music; all symphonic works involve the cello section, and many pieces require cello soli or solos. Much of the time, celli provide part of the harmony for the orchestra. On many occasions, the cello section will play the melody for a brief period of time, before returning to the harmony. There are also cello [[concerto]]s, which are orchestral pieces in which a featured, solo cellist is accompanied by an entire orchestra.

===Solo===
There are numerous [[cello concerto]]s, where the cello is accompanied by an [[orchestra]]. [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto]] for Cello, Violin and Piano and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]' [[Double Concerto (Brahms)|Double Concerto]] for Cello and Violin are also part of the concertante repertoire although in both cases the cello shares solo duties with at least one other instrument. Moreover, several composers wrote large-scale pieces for cello and orchestra, which are concertos in all but name. The most important are [[Richard Strauss]]' [[tone poem]] ''Don Quixote'', [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''Variations on a Rococo Theme'', [[Ernest Bloch]]'s ''Schelomo'' and [[Max Bruch]]'s ''Kol Nidrei''. 

In the 20th century, the cello repertoire experienced an unprecedented growth. This was largely due to the influence of virtuoso cellist [[Mstislav Rostropovich]] who inspired, commissioned and/or premiered dozens of new works. 
[[Image:Rostro pic.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Cellists [[Julian Lloyd Webber]] (left) and [[Mstislav Rostropovich]]]]
Among these, [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s Symphonia Concertante, [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]]'s Cello Symphony and the concertos of [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[Witold Lutosławski|Lutosławski]] and [[Henri Dutilleux|Dutilleux]] have already become part of the standard repertoire. In addition, [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]], [[Samuel Barber|Barber]], [[William Walton|Walton]] and [[György Ligeti|Ligeti]] also wrote major concertos for other cellists (notably [[Gregor Piatigorsky]] and [[Siegfried Palm]]). 

There are also many [[cello sonata|sonatas]] for cello and [[piano]]. Those written by [[Beethoven]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Brahms]], [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Shostakovich]], [[Prokofiev]] and [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]] are the most famous.

Finally, there are also several [[accompaniment|unaccompanied]] pieces for cello, most notably [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s  six ''[[Cello Suites (Bach)|Unaccompanied Suites for Cello]]'' (arguably the most important cello pieces), [[Zoltán Kodály]]'s ''Sonata for Solo Cello'' and Britten's three ''Unaccompanied Suites for Cello.''

===Quartet/Ensembles===
The cello is a member of the traditional [[string quartet]]. In addition, cellos are also usually part of string [[string quintets|quintets]], [[string sextet|sextet]] or [[string trio|trios]]. There have been several pieces written for a cello ensemble of up to twenty or more cellists. This type of ensemble is often called a 'cello choir'. The [[The 12 cellists of the Berlin Philharmonic|Twelve Cellists]] of the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]] (or "the Twelve" as they are commonly referred to) are a prime example of a cello choir. They play and record pieces written especially for twelve celli including adaptations of well-known popular songs.

===Popular music and jazz===
{{Prose|date=June 2007}}
Though the cello is less common in [[popular music]] than in [[European classical music|"classical" music]], it is sometimes featured in [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Rock music|rock]] recordings. The cello is rarely part of a group's standard lineup (though like its cousin the [[violin]] it is becoming more common in mainstream pop).

[[The Beatles]] pioneered the use of a cello in popular music, in songs such as "[[Eleanor Rigby]]" and "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]". In the 1970s, the [[Electric Light Orchestra]] enjoyed great commercial success taking inspiration from so-called "Beatlesque" arrangements, adding the cello (and violin) to the standard rock combo line-up. 

In 1978 the UK based rock band, Colloseum II, collaborated with cellist [[Julian Lloyd Webber]] on the recording [[Variations (album)|Variations]].

Established non-traditional cello groups include [[Apocalyptica]], a group of Finnish cellists best known for their versions of [[Metallica]] songs, [[Rasputina]], a group of two female cellists committed to an intricate cello style intermingled with Gothic music, [[Von Cello]], a cello fronted rock power trio, [[Break of Reality]], and Primitivity.  These groups are examples of a style that has become known as [[cello rock]]. The crossover string quartet [[Bond (band)|bond]] also includes a cellist. Silenzium and Vivacello are Russian (Novosibirsk) groups playing rock and metal and having more and more popularity in Siberia.

More recent bands using the cello are [[Aerosmith]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Murder by Death (band)]], and [[Cursive (band)|Cursive]]. So-called "chamber pop" artists like [[Kronos Quartet]] and [[Margot and the Nuclear So and So's]] have also recently made cello common in modern alternative rock. Heavy metal band [[System of a Down]] has also made use of the cello's rich sound. The indie rock band [[The Stiletto Formal]] are known for using a cello as a major staple of their sound. 

The cello can also used in fiddling, bluegrass, and folk music.

The cello and the double bass are now also used in some of the modern [[Chinese orchestras]].

In jazz, the bassists [[Oscar Pettiford]] and [[Harry Babasin]] were among the first to use the cello as a solo instrument; Pettiford tuned his instrument in fourths, an octave above the double bass. Contemporary jazz cellists include [[Abdul Wadud]], [[Diedre Murray]], [[Ron Carter]], [[Dave Holland]], [[David Darling]], [[Akua Dixon]], [[Ernst Reijseger]], [[Fred Lonberg-Holm]], [[Erik Friedlander]], and [[Lucio Amanti]].

==Instrument makers==
{{main|Luthier}}

A violin maker or [[luthier]] is someone who builds or repairs stringed instruments, ranging from guitars to violins. Some well known cello luthiers include:

*[[Nicolò Gagliano]]
*[[Gofriller|Matteo Gofriller]]
*[[Giovanni Battista Guadagnini]]
*[[Giuseppe Guarneri]]
*[[Domenico Montagnana]]
