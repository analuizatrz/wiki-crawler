'''''StarCraft: Insurrection''''' (formally known as '''''Insurrection: Campaigns for StarCraft''''') is an add-on pack for ''[[StarCraft]]'' developed and published by [[Aztech New Media]]<ref name="battlenet"/> and released on [[July 31]], [[1998]]. Whilst not developed by [[Blizzard Entertainment]], it does carry the official endorsement of original developers.<ref name="battlenet">{{cite web| url=http://www.battle.net/scc/faq/general.shtml| title=Official ''StarCraft'' FAQ at Battle.net| accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref>

==Overview==

Insurrection includes three new campaigns, comprising around 30 missions and over 100 new multiplayer maps. It was made using the standard [[StarEdit|Campaign Editor]] included with ''StarCraft'' and as such is unable to add new music, tilesets, cinematics or units like the complete expansion pack ''[[StarCraft: Brood War]]''.<ref name="gamespot">{{cite web| url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/insurrectioncampaignsfs/review.html| title=''Insurrection: Campaigns for StarCraft'' for PC Review at GameSpot.| accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref> However, it does include new heroes, factions and trigger sounds for briefings and key events within the campaigns.

The plot is set during the events of ''Rebel Yell'', Episode I of the original ''StarCraft'' and revolves around the [[Terran Confederacy|Confederate]] core colony called [[List of locations in the StarCraft series#Brontes|Brontes IV]] where a routine patrol fails to check in. The add-on pack does not require ''Brood War'' and due to limitations in using the Campaign Editor the missions are accessed in the same manner as any fan missions via the Custom Game screen.

The first campaign focuses on the [[Terran (StarCraft)|Terran]] inhabitants of the Brontes system and the issues rising from the imminent [[Zerg]] invasion of the system. The second campaign revolves around the [[Protoss]] Seventh Fleet, a detachment of [[Tassadar]]'s expeditionary fleet sent to neutralize the Zerg presence within the Brontes system. The final campaign, the Zerg missions, is about the Swarm's final attempts to complete the invasion and eradicate all enemies on Brontes IV. All of the missions take place within the Brontes system. 

Unlike both ''StarCraft'' and ''Brood War'', the player does not assume any specific role in either the Terran or Protoss campaigns, but simply directs the faction they are in control of. However the player assumes the character of a new sub-[[Zerg Cerebrate|Cerebrate]] in the Zerg campaign.

==Storyline==

===Terran campaign===

The Terran campaign begins with a rebel group known as the Fist of Redemption causing trouble on Brontes IV. In response to the rebels, led by the renegade Ghost Atticus Carpenter, the Marshal Bill Constantine calls in retired officer [[List of minor characters in the StarCraft universe#Frost.2C Jack|Jack Frost]] to eliminate the threat. Whilst Frost, accompanied by fellow militia officers Tsuname and Charlie Vane, is successful in his missions the situation rapidly deteriorates as both the militia and the rebels attack and counter-attack. As the Zerg begin their invasion of the world,  Marshall Constantine is relieved by the Council of Inquiry, a body formed to facilitate the defence of the Brontes system. The Council places Frost in command of the Hammer Strike Force, a large Marine division of the Confederate [[Terran Confederacy#Delta Squadron|Delta Squadron]] brought in to combat both the Fist of Redemption and the Zerg. However, when the Council orders the Hammer to kill innocents who disagree with the Council's actions, Frost deserts and control of the Hammer is given to Tsuname. Vane, with little taste for killing those whom he is supposed to protect, also deserts after the first mission against the "treasonous" communities. Frost flees to the city of New Dresdin, another community accused of treason by the Council, and with the help of his old companion Black Morgan successfully defends the city from the Hammer assault.

Frost then goes on the offensive, infiltrating the Council's headquarters with Morgan to sabotage their nuclear missile silos. The Council is destroyed as a result, but Frost's hopes for the Hammer then returning to protecting the civilians are also destroyed when Tsuname appoints himself as governor of the Brontes system, declares martial law and brands Frost and Morgan as outlaws. The fugitives, now reunited with Vane, turn their attention to the Fist of Redemption again and attack Carpenter's primary base of operations with a small force of colonial militia. During the massive battle with both the Fist of Redemption and the Zerg, it becomes clear that the Hammer are in league with the rebels when they attack the militia forces. Despite the numbers of the three enemy forces, the militia are victorious and Tsuname is killed in battle. The surviving militia return to New Dresdin to recover from the conflict.

===Protoss campaign===

The Protoss campaign begins with [[Tassadar]] briefing the Executor of the Seventh Fleet, Andraxxus, on his mission to the Brontes system. The Fleet initially engages in two space battles in orbit of Brontes IV, one to destroy the colony's communications array (held by the Zerg) and sever them from neighbouring systems and the other to secure the main orbital platform (defended by the colonial militia) as a staging area. The Fleet's Judicator advisor, Syndrea then dispatches the three ground commanders of the Seventh Fleet, Edullon, Demioch and the archon Aedus/Xerxes on missions to the surface. Edullon's forces engage the Zerg outside the city of New Dresdin where they mutually ally with Frost, Vane and Morgan. Edullon then departs in search of Demioch, who Syndrea claimed was killed on his mission. It turns out that Demioch was captured by the Fist of Redemption, but Edullon was able to free him with the assistance of Charlie Vane.

The focus then shifts to Aedus/Xerxes, whose forces attack both Terran and Zerg without discrimination under the orders of Syndrea. Aedus/Xerxes operations hurt do significant damage to the [[Zerg Brood#Incubus Brood|Incubus Brood]] by depriving them of resources and driving them into a desperate frenzy. Edullon objects to these heavy-handed tactics as they are causing the Zerg to slaughter the innocent Terrans, but Syndrea brands her a traitor. Edullon herself takes Demioch and her forces, along with Frost and the remaining Terran militia, to attack the forces of Carpenter - now in control of Incubus Brood due to a miscalculation in his assimilation by the Cerebrate [[List of minor characters in the StarCraft universe#Auza|Auza]]. As the allied Protoss and militia forces rest after this battle, they are hit by a surprise attack from Aedus/Xerxes and Syndrea's vanguard. Despite heavy losses the combined forces of the Terrans and Protoss defeat the vanguard's assault and Edullon kills Aedus/Xerxes in a hand-to-hand duel.

===Zerg campaign===

In response to the loss of Auza and the Incubus Brood, the Overmind creates a new Cerebrate (the player's character) to take control of a portion of [[Zerg Brood#Garm Brood|Garm Brood]] to complete the invasion. Under the direction of Nargil, the Cerebrate of [[Zerg Brood#Fenris Brood|Fenris Brood]], the new Cerebrate attacks the site of the last battle in the Protoss campaign, destroying both the allied Terrans and Protoss as well as the renemants of Syndrea's army, successfully capturing Syndrea. Syndrea is somehow interrogated and then killed. The Cerebrate is then tasked with destroying the last of the vanguard of the Seventh Fleet before turning the Swarm's attention to the surviving Terrans. During an infestation operation, the now renegade Incubus Brood attacks the Garm Brood, causing the Overmind to task the Cerebrate with Carpenter's destruction and giving the mission of destroying the Terrans and Protoss to Nargil. However, Fenris Brood's main hive cluster on Brontes IV is ambushed as the remaining Terrans and Protoss formally ally, forcing the Cerebrate to rescue Nargil's Brood and rediverting its attention away from Carpenter.

The Overmind decides on a more covert method of eliminating the Terrans and Protoss by infesting Black Morgan with a parasite. Using Morgan to track the Terrans, the Zerg plague Frost, Vane and Morgan until they are forced to seek Andraxxus for help. Once the remaining militia meet with Andraxxus at the Protoss primary base, the full force of the Cerebrate's Brood attacks them, slaughtering the defenders and killing Andraxxus, Demioch, Edullon, Vane, Frost and Morgan. With the Protoss and Terrans all but eradicated, the Cerebrate's forces launch one last attack on Brontes, destroying the entirety of Incubus Brood and killing the Carpenter-occupied body of the Cerebrate Auza, thereby completely completing the invasion and securing the planet.

==Reception==
''Insurrection'''s release went largely unnoticed; established reviewers such as [[IGN]]<ref name="ign">{{cite web| url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/objects/607/607866.html| title=''Insurrection: Campaigns for StarCraft'' at IGN.| accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref> and [[PC Gamer]]<ref name="pcg">{{cite web| url=http://pcgamer.pricegrabber.com/search_noresults.php?form_keyword=Insurrection%3A+Campaigns+for+StarCraft| title=''Insurrection: Campaigns for StarCraft'' at PCGamer.| accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref> do not appear to have reviewed it at all. What reception there has been, mainly from [[Gamespot]], has been negative.<ref name="gamespot"/> Gamespot itself described the add-on as "poor" and "unprofessional", although it also criticized Aztech New Media for faults that were due to the limitations of the Campaign Editor, such as the need to select the campaigns from the Custom Game screen. Fan opinion remains divided, although according to Gamespot's figures, around half of players thought the add-on was "average" or "worse".<ref name="gamespot2">{{cite web| url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/insurrectioncampaignsfs/players.html| title=User review figures for ''Insurrection: Campaigns for StarCraft'' at Gamespot.| accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref>

The extent of the availability of ''Insurrection'' is unclear; it appears that not many copies of the add-on were made. Whilst [[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard]] endorses the product, they offer no technical support or comment on its availability.<ref name="battlenet"/> Aztech itself no longer exists.

==Difficulty==

''Insurrection'' makes no effort to introduce the game to new players by having a slowly progressing level of difficulty like the original ''StarCraft''. Instead, it assumes that players already have a strong grip on the mechanics of the game, quickly scaling to the hardest AI levels.<ref name="gamespot"/> Within five missions the Terrans get full access to their entire tech tree, whilst the Zerg and Protoss have full access from the beginning. In addition to using the hardest levels of AI scripts, the add-on commonly makes use of [[suicide attack|suicidal]] AI scripting, combined with scripted and timed unit creation, to create a constant stream of enemy attacks to keep the player on edge.<ref name="gamespot"/> ''Insurrection'' also makes use of multiple enemies of all species on the battlefield,<ref name="gamespot"/> in contrast to ''StarCraft'' normally only having one species under enemy AI control.
