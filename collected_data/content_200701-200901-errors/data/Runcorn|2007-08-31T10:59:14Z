'''Runcorn''' is an industrial town and cargo port within the [[Halton (borough)|borough of Halton]] in the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of [[Cheshire]], [[England]].   In mid-2004 its population was estimated to be 61,252.<ref name="pop2004">[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/yourcouncil/population?a=5441 Halton Borough Council:Halton Population.] Accessed [[3 April]] [[2007]]</ref>  The town is on the southern bank of the [[River Mersey]] where the estuary narrows to form [[River Mersey#Runcorn Gap|Runcorn Gap]]. Directly to the north across the Mersey is the town of [[Widnes]]. Upstream and {{mi to km|8}} to the northeast is the town of [[Warrington]], and downstream {{mi to km|16}} to the west is the city of [[Liverpool]]. 

[[Runcorn railway station]] is on the [[West Coast Main Line]]. It provides frequent services to [[Euston railway station|London (Euston)]], [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Liverpool]], and [[Birmingham New Street station|Birmingham]]. The [[A533 road]] passes through the town from the south, crossing the Runcorn Gap over the [[Silver Jubilee Bridge]], the lowest bridge crossing of the [[River Mersey]]. The [[Manchester Ship Canal]] runs between the town and the River Mersey, and the [[Bridgewater Canal]] passes through and ends in the town at its junction with the Manchester Ship Canal. 

Runcorn was a small, isolated village until the coming of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries it was a [[spa town|health resort]].<ref name="S133">Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', pp133&ndash;137</ref>  Towards the end of the 18th century, a port began to develop on the south bank of the River Mersey.<ref>Starkey, ''Schooner Port'', p13</ref>  During the 19th century industries developed, in particular the manufacture of [[soap]] and [[alkali]], quarrying, shipbuilding, engineering, and tanning. In the early 20th century, the prime industries were [[chemical industry|chemicals]] and tanning.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', pp215&ndash;216</ref> The original village has grown to include what were outlying villages.  Except for chemicals, all the old industries have disappeared, and there has been diversification, in particular because of the close links to the [[motorway]] system, and the development of [[warehouse|warehousing]] and distribution centres.<ref name="ep">[http://www.englishpartnerships.co.uk/runcorn.htm English Partnerships], accessed [[28 June]] [[2007]]</ref>  A [[New town#United Kingdom|new town]] was built to the east of the existing town in the 1960s and 1970s, and farther to the east, areas of private housing have been established;<ref name="ep"/> this has resulted in a doubling of the population from around 30,000 to its present level.  

==History==
The earliest written reference to the town is in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', where it is spelled Rumcofan, literally “a wide cove or bay”. This word is derived from the [[Old English language|Old English]] words ''rúm'' (“wide” or “broad”) and ''cofa'' (“cave” or “cove”). Other historical spellings of Runcorn include Rumcoven, Ronchestorn, Runckhorne, and Runcorne.<ref>Nickson, p5, Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', p4</ref>

Little is known about the early history of the settlement but isolated findings of objects from the [[Stone Age|Stone]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s have been made and there is evidence of a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] presence in the area.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', pp. 1-4.</ref>  The earliest recorded event in its history is the building by [[Ethelfleda]] of a fortification at Runcorn to protect the northern frontier of her kingdom of [[Mercia]] against the [[Viking]]s in 915. The fort was built on Castle Rock overlooking the River Mersey at Runcorn Gap.<ref>Nickson, pp. 6-13. The foundations of the fort were discovered during the building of the railway bridge but were covered by an abutment of the bridge.</ref>

[[Image:Halton Castle engraving.jpg|thumb|left|270 px|Halton Castle in the 18th century]]
Following the [[Norman conquest]], Runcorn was not mentioned in the 1086 [[Domesday Book|Domesday]] survey, although surrounding settlements were. [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] granted the [[Earl of Chester|earldom of Chester]] to [[Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester|Hugh d'Avranches]] who granted the [[Barons of Halton|barony of Halton]] to Nigel.  It is likely that Nigel erected a [[motte and bailey]] [[castle]] on Halton Hill in the 1070s.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', pp. 7-8.</ref>  In 1115, Nigel's son, William Fitznigel, founded an [[Augustinian]] [[Priory]] at Runcorn. In 1134 the priory was moved to Norton, about 3.5&nbsp;miles (5.5&nbsp;km) away. In 1391 the priory was raised to the higher status of [[abbey]].<ref>Greene, pp. 1-9.</ref> In 1536 the monastery was dissolved, and around nine years later the buildings and some of the monastic lands were sold to Sir [[Richard Brooke]] who converted the habitable part of the abbey into a house.<ref>Greene, p. 151, Nickson, p. 39.</ref>

During the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] Halton Castle was held for the [[Cavaliers|Royalists]] by John Savage, 2nd [[Earl Rivers]], the Steward of Halton. It fell twice to Parliamentarian [[Roundheads]]. The first siege was led by [[Sir William Brereton]] in 1643; the second was during the following year. Following this, a "Council of War" was held in Warrington in 1646 at which it was decided that the castle should be [[Slighting|slighted]].<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', pp. 57-58</ref>  In 1656, Runcorn was described as being "nothing but a fair parish church, a parsonage and a few scattered tenements".<ref>King, Daniel, ''The Vale Royal of England'', 1656.</ref>  And so it remained for over a century, an isolated and poor hamlet.  The only through traffic used the [[ferry]] which crossed from Runcorn to the north bank of the River Mersey.  Towards the end of the 18th century and in the early years of the 19th century the town was a health resort.<ref name="S133"/>

During the 18th century water transport had been improved in the area by the Mersey and [[Irwell]] Navigation, the [[Bridgewater Canal]] and the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]].  This gave Runcorn waterway connections with most of the interior of England through the [[canal]] system and with the sea along the River Mersey, thus forming the basis for the development of the [[Port of Runcorn]].<ref>Starkey, ''Schooner Port'', pp. 19-24, ''Old Runcorn'', pp.125-130.</ref>  Later came the Runcorn to [[Latchford]] canal, and the Weston canal which gave better access to the Weaver Navigation system.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', p. 173.</ref>  Industries began to develop within and around the town, in particular [[quarrying]] for Runcorn [[sandstone]], [[shipbuilding]], [[engineering]], the manufacture of [[soap]] and [[chemicals]] and [[tanning]].  Runcorn was becoming an industrialised and highly [[polluted]] town.  During the later 19th century the town became increasingly dominated by the chemical and tanning industries.  

In 1868 the [[Runcorn Railway Bridge]] was opened across the Mersey, giving Runcorn direct rail links with [[Liverpool]] and the rest of the country.<ref>Nickson, p. 206.</ref>  In the 1880s a pipeline was opened between Northwich and Weston Point, supplying [[brine]] to the salt and chemical works.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', pp. 160-162.</ref>  In 1894 the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] was opened throughout its length.<ref>Starkey, ''Schooner Port'', p. 184.</ref>  This allowed ocean-going ships to travel inland as far as [[Salford]], some of them calling at the port of Runcorn.  The rise in population between 1881 and 1891 and the drop by 1901 is explained by the number of people involved in constructing the ship canal.  In 1905 the [[Widnes-Runcorn Transporter Bridge]] opened, giving a direct link for vehicular traffic for the first time between the two towns.<ref>Thompson, ''Bridging the Years'', p.17.</ref>

During the first half of the 20th century the industry of the town continued to be dominated by chemicals and tanning.  In 1926 four chemical companies merged to form [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI).  As the century progressed there was diversification of industry. In 1961 the Transporter Bridge was replaced by Runcorn Road Bridge (since named the Silver Jubilee Bridge) which allowed a more efficient means of road traffic across Runcorn Gap.  The designation of Runcorn as a new town in 1964 brought major changes and more than doubled the population. Much of the architecture of the new town was innovative, especially the Southgate development designed by [[James Stirling (architect)|Sir James Stirling]] and built between 1970 and 1977.  Stirling's housing development was beset with problems and it was demolished in the early 1990s.<ref>[http://www.bdonline.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=430&storycode=3084063&c=2&encCode=00000000012cb5c6 Building Design], accessed [[27 July]] [[2007]]</ref>  During the second half of the 20th century the tanneries closed and the chemical industry declined. At the same time, light industry developed together with [[warehouse]]s and distribution centres.<ref name="ep"/>

==Governance==
===Civic history===
[[Image:Halton Grange, Runcorn.jpg|thumb|left|Runcorn Town Hall, formerly Halton Grange]]
At the time of the [[Domesday Book|Domesday]] survey, Runcorn was in the [[Hundred (country subdivision)|hundred]] of Tunendune,<ref>Phillips, p27</ref> but later, and until the early 19th century, Runcorn was part of the Bucklow hundred.<ref>Phillips, p9</ref>  Under the Runcorn Improvement Act 1852, a board of [[Improvement commissioners|Improvement Commissioners]] was established to administer the civil government of the town.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', p193</ref>  By the [[Local Government Act 1894]], the administration of the town and the surrounding areas was divided into Runcorn [[Urban District]] and Runcorn [[Rural District]].  Initially the urban district consisted of only the built-up area of Runcorn itself.  By 1937, this area had been extended to include the communities of Weston and Weston Point to the south. By 1971 it had been further extended to the east to incorporate the village of Halton.<ref>Phillips, p11</ref>

In 1964, Runcorn was designated as a new town. In 1974, as part of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], Runcorn Urban District was abolished and its territory amalgamated with [[Widnes]] to form the borough of Halton.  In 1998, this borough became a [[unitary authority]] within the ceremonial county of Cheshire.<ref>[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/yourcouncil/theboroughofhalton?a=5441 Halton Borough Council: The Borough of Halton], accessed [[23 April]] [[2007]]</ref>

===Political representation===
Before the [[Reform Act 1832]], Runcorn was in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary]] [[constituency]] of Cheshire whch was represented by two [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]].<ref>Phillips, p100</ref> Following the Reform Act, the town was placed in the [[North Cheshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Cheshire]] constituency and from 1868 in the [[Mid Cheshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Cheshire]] constituency.  From 1885 to 1950 the town was in the constituency of [[Northwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Northwich]].<ref>Phillips, pp102&ndash;103</ref>  By an [[act of Parliament]] in 1948, the constituency of [[Runcorn (UK Parliament constituency)|Runcorn]] was created, and in 1950 Runcorn's first Member of Parliament, [[Dennis Vosper, Baron Runcorn|Dennis Vosper]], was elected.<ref>Starkey, ''Old Runcorn'', p221</ref> He continued to represent the constituency until 1964, when he was succeeded by [[Mark Carlisle]].<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/07/19/db1901.xml Obituary], accessed [[28 June]] [[2007]]</ref>  
Since 1983 Runcorn has been part of the constituency of [[Halton (UK Parliament constituency)|Halton]].  From that time the Member of Parliament has always been a member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]]. The first MP was [[Gordon Oakes]], and since the general election of 1997 the MP has been [[Derek Twigg]].<ref>[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/content/councilanddemocracy/mps?a=5441 Halton Borough Council: MPs], accessed [[26 March]] [[2007]]</ref>  

The local authority is the borough of Halton. The town is divided into ten [[Ward (politics)|electoral wards]].<ref>[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/yourcouncil/localdemocracy/?a=5441 Halton Borough Council: Local Democracy], accessed [[26 March]] [[2007]]</ref>  There are 56 local councillors: 33 represent the Labour party, 15 the [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat party]], and 8 the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]].<ref>[http://councillors.halton.gov.uk/mgMemberIndex.asp?FN=PARTY&VW=LIST&PIC=0 Halton Borough Council:Your Councillors], accessed [[4 July]] [[2004]]</ref>

==Geography==
[[Image:Runcorn Cheshire map (railways).png|thumb|280px|Sketch map of Runcorn and surrounding area]]
Runcorn is situated on a spur projecting into the River Mersey, which flows to the north and then to the west of the town. On the north bank of the river is another spur forming the West Bank area of Widnes; together these form Runcorn Gap, a narrowing of the River Mersey. Runcorn Gap is crossed by the [[Runcorn Railway Bridge]], which carries the Liverpool branch of the West Coast Main Line, and the [[Silver Jubilee Bridge]], which carries the A533 road. To the south of the town is the [[River Weaver]] and the Weston Canal. Both open into the ship canal. To the southeast of the town run the [[M56 motorway]], the [[Chester to Manchester Line|Chester–Manchester railway line]], and the main branch of the West Coast Main Line.  The town has a system of [[expressway]]s, roads designed to divert traffic away from the residential areas.<ref name="nt">[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/yourcouncil/townsandvillages/runcornnewtown?a=5441 Halton Borough Council:Runcorn New Town], accessed [[28 June]] [[2007]]</ref> The Central Expressway runs through the centre of the town in a north-south direction.  To the west of it lie most of the former settlements which formed the older part of the town, namely Runcorn, Higher Runcorn, Weston, Weston Point and Clifton (formerly Rocksavage), and the new town areas of Halton Brook and Halton Lodge.  To the east are the village of Halton, the old settlements of Norton and Stockham, and the new town areas of Castlefields, Palacefields, Windmill Hill, Murdishaw, Brookvale, and Hallwood Park.<ref>[[Ordnance Survey]], ''Explorer'' 275 map</ref>

The density of housing is generally high, but there are open green areas, in particular [[Heath (habitat)|heathland]] on Runcorn Hill and the extensive Town Park created as part of the new town.  The older industries, particularly the remaining chemical factories, are concentrated mainly to the southwest of the town bordering the Mersey, while newer industries, including [[warehouse|warehousing]], are to the northeast and southeast.<ref name="ep"/>
[[Image:Runcorn Hill 3.jpg|thumb|left|Runcorn Hill, showing cutting through sandstone]]
===Geology===

The Runcorn area drains into the River Mersey to the north and the River Weaver to the south.  The [[bedrock]] of the western and northeastern parts of the town is made up of rock from the Sherwood [[sandstone]] group; in the other areas the bedrock is from the Mercia [[mudstone]] group. In places there are prominent [[outcrop]]s of sandstone, particularly at Runcorn Hill and Halton Hill. Elsewhere the bedrock is covered by [[drift (geology)|drift]]. At the northwestern periphery of the town the drift consists of recently blown [[sand]]. Farther to the east and bordering the River Mersey is recent [[alluvium]]. Elsewhere the drift consists of [[till]].<ref>Phillips, pp4&ndash;5</ref>

===Climate===
Being close to the west coast and the [[Irish Sea]], the climate is generally [[temperate]] with few extremes of temperature or weather.  The mean average temperature in the years 1971 to 2000 was 9.4 to 9.7[[Celsius|°C]], which was slightly above the average for the United Kingdom<ref>[http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/17.gif Met Office: Average annual mean temperature], accessed [[22 May]] [[2007]]</ref> as was the average amount of annual sunshine at 1391 to 1470 hours.<ref>[http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/ss/17.gif Met. Office:Average annual sunshine], accessed [[22 May]] [[2007]]</ref> The average annual rainfall was 741 to 870 mm, which was slightly below the average for the UK.<ref>[http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/rr/17.gif Met Office: Average annual rainfall], accessed [[22 May]] [[2007]]</ref>  The average number of days in the year when snow is on the ground is 0 to 6, which is low for the United Kingdom.<ref>[http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/dl/17.gif Met Office: Days of snow lying], accessed [[22 May]] [[2007]]</ref> The average number of days of air frost is 2 to 39, which is also low.<ref>[http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/daf/17.gif Met Office: Days of air frost], accessed [[22 May]] [[2007]]</ref>

==Demography==
[[Image:Castlefields Runcorn New Town.jpg|thumb|Housing in Castlefields, Runcorn New Town]]
Since the borough of Halton became a unitary authority in 1998, demographic statistics have been collated for the authority as a whole, rather than separately for the towns of Runcorn and Widnes.  While the two towns have different histories and come from different historic counties, their demographic features are similar. 

The population of Halton in 2004 was 118,915. It is the most densely populated district in Cheshire at 14.9 persons per hectare.<ref>[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/yourcouncil/population?a=5441 Halton Borough Council:Halton Population], accessed [[4 April]] [[2007]]</ref> The change in population during the 20th century is shown in the following table.

In 2003 Halton had the largest proportion of the population in Cheshire in the age groups under 5, 5 to 15, and 16 to pension age and, at 16.1% the lowest proportion of people at pension age or older.  At 1.2% the proportion of non-white ethnic groups in 2001 equalled the lowest in all local authorities in Cheshire.  At 11.5 per 1,000 population, the live birth rate in Halton and Warrington is the highest in the county.  At 121 the standardised mortality ratio is the highest in Cheshire, as is the percentage of persons with limiting long-term illness (21.5%).<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_compendia/region_in_figures_winter04/North_West.pdf National Statistics:Region in Figures, North West Winter 2004/05], pp24, 26, accessed [[4 April]] [[2007]]</ref>

There has been an increase in the number of households from 47,214 in 1991 to 52,501 in 2006. The average household size has fallen from 2.70 in 1991 to 2.44 in 2001. In 1991, 75.8% of houses were centrally heated, compared with 89.8% in 2001. The type of housing has also changed, with an increase from 15.5% to 19.2% in detached houses from 1991 to 2001, an increase over the same years in semi-detached houses from 30.0% to 33.0%, and a corresponding decrease in terraced houses from 44.0% to 37.5%.<ref name="hstats">[http://www2.halton.gov.uk/content/councilanddemocracy/council/research/factbook?a=5441 Halton Borough Council: Halton Unitary in Figures], accessed [[4 April]] [[2007]]</ref>  The percentage of dwellings in council tax bands A-B is, at 69%, the highest in any Cheshire local authority.

==Economy==
[[Image:Chemical Works Weston Point.jpg|thumb|left|Chemical works at Weston Point, Runcorn]]
Of Runcorn's former industries, all but the chemical industry have disappeared.  The industry was dominated for many years by ICI; it has since been taken over by [[Ineos]].  In Runcorn, Ineos manufactures chemicals including [[chlorine]], chlorine-containing compounds including [[vinyl chloride]], heavy chemicals including [[alkali]]s, and [[fluorine]]-containing compounds.  A separate business within the same company manufactures salt from [[brine]] transported by [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] from the saltfields of central Cheshire.<ref>[http://www.ineos.com/index.php Ineos], accessed [[29 March]] [[2007]]</ref>  The former ICI offices and laboratories now comprise the Heath Business and Technical Park, which provides office, laboratory, conference, and leisure facilities.<ref>[http://www.theheath.com/ The Heath Business and Technical Park], accessed [[29 March]] [[2007]]</ref>  To the east of the town, diverse industries have been developed including, because of the proximity to the motorway system, warehouses and distribution centres.<ref name="ep"/>  The town continues to act as a port on the Manchester Ship Canal.  There are two adjacent ports, Runcorn Port, which is owned by the Manchester Ship Canal,<ref>[http://www.clydeport.co.uk/index.php?site_id=6&page_id=417 Port of Runcorn], accessed [[14 May]] [[2007]]</ref> and the Port of Weston.<ref>[http://www.portweston.co.uk The Port of Weston], accessed [[14 May]] [[2007]]</ref>

There has been a shift in employment from manufacturing to service industries.  In  1991 34% worked in the manufacturing sector and 61% were in the service sector.  By 2004 17% were in manufacturing jobs and 78% were in service jobs.<ref name="hstats"/>  This trend in the local region is demonstrated in this chart which shows the regional "gross value added" of Halton and Warrington at current basic prices, with figures in millions of British [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]].<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_economy/RegionalGVA.pdf National statistics:Regional Gross Value Added] p242, accessed [[4 April]] [[2007]]</ref>
