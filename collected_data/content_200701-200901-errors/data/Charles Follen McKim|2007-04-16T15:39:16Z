'''Charles Follen McKim''' ([[August 24]], [[1847]]–[[September 14]], [[1909]]) was one of the most prominent American [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] [[architect]]s of the late nineteenth century, as a member of the partnership [[McKim, Mead, and White]] (''q.v.'' for list of works).  He was named after [[Charles Follen]], noted [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] and [[Unitarian]] minister.

McKim studied architecture at the [[Ecole des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]] before joining the office of [[Henry Hobson Richardson]] in [[1870]].  McKim formed his own firm in partnership with [[William Rutherford Mead]], joined in [[1877]] by fellow Richardson protegé [[Stanford White]].  For ten years, the firm was primarily known for their open-plan informal summer houses.  McKim became best known, however, as an exponent of Beaux-Arts architecture in styles that exemplified the [[American Renaissance]], exemplified by the [[Boston Public Library]] (1887), and several works in [[New York City]]: the Morningside Heights campus of [[Columbia University]] (1893), the [[University Club]] (1899), the [[Pierpont Morgan Library]] (1903), [[New York Penn Station]] (1904–10), and The [[Butler Institute of American Art]] in [[Youngstown, Ohio]] (1919).

McKim received numerous awards during his lifetime, including the Medaille d'Or at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 Paris Exposition]], a gold medal from [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom]], and honorary doctorates from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[Columbia University|Columbia]].  He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Institute of Architects]] in 1877, and received the AIA's gold medal, posthumously, in 1909.
