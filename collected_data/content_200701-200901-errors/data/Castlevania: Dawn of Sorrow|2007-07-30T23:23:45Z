{{nihongo|'''''Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow'''''|悪魔城ドラキュラ 蒼月の十字架|Akumajō Dorakyura: Sogetsu no Jujika|lit. "Demon Castle Dracula: Cross of the Blue Moon"}}, is the first ''[[Castlevania]]'' [[video game]] to appear on the [[Nintendo DS]], and is a sequel to ''[[Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow]]''. The game was developed by [[Konami]] and was first released on [[August 25]], [[2005]], in Japan, followed a release in September in Europe and an October release in the United States. The game was re-released in Japan on [[June 29]], [[2006]], in the "[[Konami the Best]]" line.<ref name="gamefaq-release">{{cite web | title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow Info | url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/ds/data/922145.html | publisher=[[GameFAQs]] | accessdate=2007-04-05}}</ref>



==Gameplay==
''Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow'' is a platform game with RPG stat-building elements.<ref name="gamespyrev">{{cite web|url=http://ds.gamespy.com/nintendo-ds/castlevania/655359p1.html|title=GameSpy: Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow Review|author=Leeper, Justin|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=[[2005-10-04]]|accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref> The player guides Soma Cruz through a large sprawling castle, where he or she has almost free reign to go wherever he or she wishes.  However, similar to the ''[[Metroid (series)|Metroid]]'' series, certain areas are inaccessible until the player defeats key enemies and obtains critical items.  Along the way, the player must defeat a horde of monsters that roam the various rooms of the castle with the weapons he or she finds along the way. The more enemies the player defeats, and the stronger the enemy, the more experience points they get, which enables them to [[Experience point|level up]] and improve their abilities.<ref name="gamespotreview">{{cite web|url=http://gamespot.com/ds/action/castlevania/review.html|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow for DS review|author=Mueller, Greg|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=[[2005-10-06]]|accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref> Several items, including weapons, armor, and accessories, can be found around the castle, dropped by defeated foes, or purchased at Hammer's shop, and can be used to increase the player's statistics.
[[Image:Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow 01.jpg|thumb|Screenshot of gameplay showing both DS screens]]
The game features the "Tactical Soul" system from ''Aria of Sorrow'', where Soma can absorb the soul of an enemy he defeats and can use their power. ''Dawn of Sorrow'' improves on the previous system by allowing the player to upgrade most soul abilities by acquiring multiple copies of the same soul.<ref name="1upreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3144293|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow DS Review|author=Parish, Jeremy|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|date=[[2005-10-03]]|accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref> Souls can also be used in weapon synthesis to create rare and powerful weapons.

A new feature, the "Magic Seal" system, makes use of the system's touch screen. Using the DS stylus, the player must draw an intricate pattern known as a magic seal on the touch screen in order to trap defeated boss enemies. If the seal is not drawn correctly, the boss will regenerate some energy and continue to fight. The touch screen can also be used to break certain blocks, navigate menus, select a warp point, and control certain [[familiar]]s.<ref name="ignreview">{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/655/655830p1.html|title=IGN: Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow Review|author=Harris, Craig|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=[[2005-10-04]]|accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref>

The game also has a multiplayer vs. mode, where one player creates a section of the castle, complete with enemies, and both players race to defeat the enemies and reach the end of the level; players are also able to trade souls they've found in the game.

===Julius Mode===
By finishing the game once with either the true ending or the bad ending (in which Soma awakens as the Dark Lord), the player unlocks Julius Mode,<ref name="gamefaqcheat">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/ds/code/922145.html|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow Cheats|publisher=[[GameFAQs]]|accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref> where one can play as [[Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Julius Belmont|Julius Belmont]], [[Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Yoko Belnades|Yoko Belnades]], and [[Alucard (Castlevania)|Alucard]]. Julius is armed with the traditional Vampire Killer whip, as well as the Axe, Holy Water, Cross Boomerang, and Cross Crash special attacks. Yoko is a witch who fights like her ancestor Sypha Belnades with a staff and fire, ice, and lightning spells. Alucard attacks with the Alucard Sword, Hellfire spell, and has the ability to turn into a bat. The gameplay is the same as the main game, except that the bosses do not require a Magic Seal and Soma is the final boss of the game. Soma will utilize several of the souls in the game for attacks, and transforms into a giant demonic creature after taking enough damage, in homage to the form Dracula assumed in ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood]]''. This strongly coincides with the events of ''[[Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse]]''.

The announcement of a new Castlevania game for the [[Nintendo DS]] first appeared on [[IGN]] on [[August 1]], [[2004]],<ref name="ign-newds">{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/535/535076p1.html|title=IGN: New DS Titles!|author=Gantayat, Anoop|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=[[2004-08-01]]|accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref> with the publishing of the game being accredited to Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo. Hard details about the game did not appear until [[January 5]], [[2005]], when Konami announced that the game would be a sequel to ''[[Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow]]''.<ref name="gamespot-20050106">{{cite web|url=http://gamespot.com/ds/action/castlevania/news.html?sid=6115834|title=Castlevania coming to DS - DS News at GameSpot|author=Surette, Tim|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=[[2005-01-06]]|accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref><ref name="ign-20050106">

==Presentation==

Several enemies in ''Dawn of Sorrow'' were sprites also used in ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'', including bosses Slogra and Gaibon as standard enemies and the boss Karasuman (renamed Malphas). Subsequently, many enemies and their sprites (among them several bosses) were reused in ''[[Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin]]''.

The game's artwork, including the box cover, the movie that plays if the game is left at the title screen, and the character portraits, are drawn in a distinct [[anime]] style. This is because the game's producer Koji Igarashi also wanted to market the game to younger audiences who watched cartoons.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

==Awards and reception==
{{Expand|date=January 2007}}
Generally, ''Dawn of Sorrow'' received high praise from reviewers, with a 89/100 average rating of 52 published reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ds/castlevaniads|title=Metacritic: Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref> Though there was not a huge leap in graphics between ''Dawn of Sorrow'' and its predecessor, ''Aria of Sorrow'', critics did not seem to mind.<ref name="ignreview"/><ref name="gamespyrev"/> In fact, it gained praise for following the "tried-and-true Castlevania formula".<ref name="gamespotreview"/> However, critics were unimpressed by the game's use of the touchscreen features, with it being described as "ancillary in practice".<ref name="gamespotreview"/> The "seal drawing" aspect of the game was lambasted as being unnecessary,<ref name="ignreview"/> awkward,<ref name="gamespotreview"/> and a gimmick.<ref name="gamespyrev"/>
