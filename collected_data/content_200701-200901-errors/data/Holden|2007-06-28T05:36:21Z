'''GM Holden Ltd''' or '''Holden''' is an [[Australia]]n [[automaker]] based in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], originally independent but now a subsidiary of [[General Motors]] (GM).<ref name = "profile">{{cite web | url = http://www.holden.com.au/www-holden/jsp/corporateinfo/companyprofile/companyprofile.jsp | title = Holden: Company Profile | publisher = GM Holden Ltd | accessdate = 2007-05-27}}</ref> Holden is one of GM's "alpha" brands, taking charge of vehicles and operations for General Motors in Australasia, and have responsibility for [[GM Daewoo]] in [[South Korea]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Reid | first = Damien | url = http://www.customfleet.com.au/downloads/ArticlesOfInterest/interest+apr+2004_3852.pdf | title = US considers Asian region for large car future | publisher = Custom Fleet | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref>

Over the years, Holden has offered a broad range of vehicles, the vast majority being the locally produced Holden range, with supplementary models sourced from various other parts of the General Motors empire, including [[Chevrolet]], [[Pontiac]], [[Opel]], GM Daewoo, [[Isuzu]], [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] and [[Suzuki]]. Some of these cars have been assembled locally; others have been fully imported. In addition, Holden has in the past offered rebadged [[Nissan]] and [[Toyota]] models in sharing arrangements.<ref name = "milestones">{{cite web | url = http://media.gm.com/aus/holden/en/company/history/history_milestones.html | title = Holden Company Milestones | publisher = [[General Motors]] | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref> [[Holden New Zealand]], is GM's subsidiary in New Zealand, and an assembly plant based in [[Petone]] opened in 1926.

==History of the marque==
===Early history===
In 1852 James Alexander Holden immigrated to [[South Australia]] from [[England]], and established J.A Holden & Co, a saddlery business in [[Adelaide]] in 1856.<ref name = "heritage1">{{cite web | last = Kennedy | first = Alistair | coauthors = Kennedy, Ewan; Davis, Tony | url = http://media.gmcanada.com:8221/aus/holden/en/company/history/HH13Part1.pdf | title = The Holden Heritage - 13th Edition, part one | publisher = GM Holden Ltd | accessdate = 2007-05-09}}</ref> In 1905, [[Edward Holden (Australian car manufacturer)|Edward Wheewall Holden]], James' son, entered the firm and was interested in automobiles.<ref>{{cite web | last = Hancock | first = Joan | coauthors = Richards, Eric | url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090705b.htm | title = Holden, Sir Edward Wheewall (1885 - 1947) | publisher = Australian Dictionary of Biography | accessdate = 2007-05-18}}</ref> The firm evolved through various partnerships and in 1908, as Holden and Frost, moved into the business of minor repairs to car upholstery and manufacturing hoods and side curtains.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/history_holden.htm | title = Holden History | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref> In 1913 the firm began to produce complete motorcycle sidecar bodies, and Edward Holden experimented with fitting bodies on different types of carriages.<ref name = "milestones"/> From 1917, wartime trade restrictions led to Holden and Frost commencing large scale production of car bodies.

H.J Holden incorporated a new company in 1919, ''Holden's Motor Body Builders Ltd'' (HMBB).<ref name = "heritage1"/> Holden's Motor Body Builders Ltd made bodies to suit a number of [[chassis]] imported from different manufacturers, such as [[Buick]], and [[Dodge]].<ref name = "milestones"/> Then in 1931 General Motors purchased the business and formed ''General Motors–Holden's Ltd''.<ref name = "heritage1"/> Since then two name changes have occurred, the first being in 1998, when it was renamed ''Holden Ltd'' and in May 2005 there was yet another name change, becoming known as ''GM Holden Ltd''.<ref name = "heritage1"/>

===Australia's own car===
[[Image:48-215 launch.jpg|thumb|Launch of the first Holden in November 1948 by Prime Minister [[Ben Chifley]].]]
After the end of [[World War II]], the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] took steps to encourage an Australian automotive industry.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.holden.com.au/www-holden/jsp/corporateinfo/history/chifley.jsp | title = The Birth of 'Australia's Own Car' | publisher = GM Holden Ltd | accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref> While it is widely accepted that General Motors was the only automobile manufacturer to accept the challenge to build "Australia's Own Car", both [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and General Motors provided studies to the Australian Government of the day. Ford's long and complex document listed the impact and employment effects of a Ford based vehicle and associated infrastructure, whereas GM's was a simple three page list, showing each member of parliament and what each member would receive in 'financial aid'.<ref name = "NAA">{{cite web | url = http://www.naa.gov.au/The_Collection/transport/road.html | title = Road transport | publisher = [[National Archives of Australia]] | accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref>

Holden's managing director [[Laurence Hartnett]] was particularly enthusiastic about developing and building an Australian car, and the Holden [[Holden 48-215|48-215]] (also unofficially called the FX) was introduced in 1948. The [[Mid-size car|mid-size]] 48-215 was fitted with a 132.5&nbsp;[[cubic inch]] (2171&nbsp;cc) engine,<ref name = "heritage1"/> and spawned off a design proposed for a more compact post World War II [[Chevrolet]].<ref name = "drive">{{Cite web | last = Morley | first = David | date = [[2004-10-14]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/buy/TopTen/ChangedTheWorld.aspx | title = 10 cars that changed the world | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref> The proposal had been rejected because it was deemed being too small for the [[United States]] market. Although not particularly mechanically or stylistically sophisticated, it was simple, rugged, more powerful than most competitors, and offered exceptional performance and [[fuel economy]] in an affordable package.<ref name = "heritage1"/> 

===1950s: domination of the Australian market===
During the 1950s, Holden dominated the Australian marketplace, offering buyers a unique combination of style, comfort, performance, economy and value for money that no competitor could match.<ref name = "NAA"/><ref name = "heritage1"/> Less expensive four-cylinder cars did not offer Holden's rugged ability in country areas.<ref name = "NAA"/> Another factor in Holden's success was the large investment in production capacity, which allowed Holden to take advantage of post-war demand for motor cars.<ref name = "milestones"/> The [[Holden 48-215]] was produced in parallel with the [[Holden 50-2106|50-2106]] [[coupe utility]] body style from 1951, which became known [[Colloquialism|colloquially]] as the "[[Holden Ute]]". The "Ute" became a ubiquitous sight in Australian [[rural]] areas, as the workhorse of choice for a generation of primary producers. The 48-215 was produced with minor running changes until 1953, when it was replaced by the facelifted [[Holden FJ|FJ]] model.<ref name = "ute">{{cite web | date = [[2001-04-24]] | url = http://www.autoweb.com.au/cms/newsarticle.html?&start=70&showall=&id=HOL&doc=gmh0104242 | title = An Aussie Icon Turns 50 - The Holden Ute: 1951 - 2001 | publisher = Web Publications Pty Limited | accessdate = 2007-05-30}}</ref>

The FJ was the first major change to the Holden since its 1948 introduction. Over time it gained iconic status, and remains one of Australia's most recognisable automotive symbols.<ref name = "heritage1"/> The FJ featured a new horizontally slated radiator grille and changes to other trim features. No changes were made to the car's body panels.<ref name = "heritage1"/> The most significant mechanical change was the introduction of [[Telescoping (mechanics)|telescopic]] [[shock absorber]]s in early 1953, prior to the FJ's introduction. In 2005, Holden paid homage to the FJ, by unveling the [[Holden Efijy]] concept car at the Sydney Motor Show.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rsportscars.com/eng/cars/holden_efijy.asp | title = 2005 Holden Efijy Concept | publisher = RSportsCars.com | accessdate = 2007-05-30}}</ref>

[[Image:Millionth Holden.JPG|thumb|left|The millionth Holden (an EJ) comes off the line at [[Dandenong, Victoria]] on [[October 25]] [[1962]].]]

While the FJ was little changed from the 48-215, shrewd marketing, including strategic price cuts kept vehicle sales steady, until a completely redesigned new model — the FE was launched in 1956. The FE continued to use the same mechanical components as the FJ, but featured a new contemporary appearance, and was accompanied by the addition of a [[station wagon]] body style, called the "Station Sedan". The strong sales trend continued for the FE, and Holden achieved the remarkable feat of over 50% market share.<ref name = "ute"/> The FE lifespan lasted two years, when a lightly facelifted FC model was introduced.<ref name = "heritage1"/> As well as manufacturing their own vehicles, Holden assembled the British [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhalls]] and [[North America]]n [[Chevrolet]]s and [[Pontiac]]s well throughout the 1950s.<ref name = "NZheritage"/>

===1960s: response to the challenge of competition===
The 1960s marked a time of change for Holden. For the first time, they faced serious competition, as their major competitors finally sourced cars and built production capacity which allowed them to make a serious challenge to Holden's dominance. The decade opened with Holden offering their third major new model: the FB. Styling was inspired by 1957 Chevrolets, with [[tailfin]]s and a wrap around [[windshield]] with "dog leg" [[Pillar (car)|A-pillars]]. By the time Holden introduced the FB in 1960, many considered the appearance to be dated, as it was based on a three year old Chevrolet design. Much of the motoring industry at the time noted that the adopted styling did not translate well to the more compact Holden. The FB became the first Holden adapted for [[Driving on the left or right|left-hand drive]] markets, enhancing its export potential.<ref name = "heritage1"/>

In 1960, [[Ford]] unveiled the new [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]] to the Australian market. This came only months after its introduction in the [[United States]], and only months after Holden introduced the FB. In terms of styling, the Falcon's headlights were incorporated into the radiator grille, and the availability of [[automatic transmission]] was made. To Holden's advantage however, the Falcon suffered from serious durability weaknesses, particularly in the front suspension, which Holden soon exploited. Early tests reinforced that the car was not well suited for [[Environment of Australia|Australian conditions]], and Falcon customers discovered the same problems.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Mercer | first = Sandy | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_ford_falcon_xk.htm | title = Ford Falcon XK | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref>

In response to Ford's new Falcon, Holden in 1961 introduced the EK, a facelifted of the FB featuring two-tone paintwork and chrome trim.<ref name = "heritage1"/> The availability of automatic transmission was welcomed by the motoring press and consumers. After the advent of the EK, yet another update was made to the Holden lineup in 1962: the EJ.<ref name = "heritage1"/> This was followed by the EH in 1963, which featured the new "[[Holden Red motor|Red motor]]". The update improved vehicle performance substantially, when compared to the previous "[[Holden Grey motor|Grey motor]]" and continued to power Holden vehicles all through to the 1978 [[Holden VB Commodore|VB Commodore]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/holden_red_motor.htm | title = Holden 6 Cylinder RED Motor | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-09}}</ref>

[[Image:1968-1971 Holden Brougham 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Holden Brougham]] (1968–1971) was Holden's first [[Full-size car|full-size]] [[Luxury vehicle|luxury car]]. Broughhams were based on the mainstream [[Holden Kingswood|Kingswoods]] of the same years, but featured a greatly lengthened rear body.]]

In February 1965 Holden introduced the HD,<ref name = "heritage1"/> which was quickly updated by the facelifted HR in April 1966 because the car's styling did not resonate favourably with the market. The HR had new front and rear styling, higher capacity engines and Holden sold in excess of 250,000 units over the two year production run. In 1968, Holden introduced its next major new model, the HK.<ref name = "HK">{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_hk.htm | title = Holden HK | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref> Certain specification levels of the new model included Holden's first [[V8 engine]], an imported [[Chevrolet]] engine.<ref name = "heritage2">{{cite web | last = Kennedy | first = Alistair | coauthors = Kennedy, Ewan; Davis, Tony | url = http://media.gmcanada.com:8221/aus/holden/en/company/history/HH13Part2.pdf | title = The Holden Heritage - 13th Edition, part two | publisher = GM Holden Ltd | accessdate = 2007-05-09}}</ref> A long-wheelbase "prestige" model – the [[Holden Brougham|Brougham]] was born off the HK, and the first full-size two-door Holden, the [[Holden Monaro|Monaro]] was based off the HK sedan.<ref name = "heritage2"/> The name 'Monaro' is an [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] word meaning "higher ground" or "higher plain".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.webwombat.com.au/motoring/news_reports/4_05_hold.htm | title = Monaro arriving this year | publisher = WebWombat Pty Ltd | accessdate = 2007-06-14}}</ref> Holden's main-stream model, the [[Holden Special]], was rebranded the: [[Holden Kingswood|Kingswood]], and a basic [[Fleet vehicle|fleet model]] was introduced, known as the [[Holden Belmont|Belmont]].<ref name = "HK"/>

1969 saw the introduction of the HT: a facelift of the HK. The exterior changes included a new radiator grille,<ref name = "HT">{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_ht.htm | title = Holden HT | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref> the first Holden grille to be manufactured from plastic, new rear doors on [[sedan]]s (with larger windows) and new rear styling, with a larger rear window, boot lid and tail lights. A major engineering feat for Holden was the introduction of the first Australian designed and mass produced V8 engine, available in two Capacities: 253&nbsp;cubic inch (4.2&nbsp;L) and 308&nbsp;cubic inch (5.0&nbsp;L).<ref name = "HT"/> The 253&nbsp;cubic inch engine was marketed as Australia's first "small V8", and Holden predicted that the V8 would become as popular in the Australian market as in the United States.

The following year, Holden offered the HG: a lightly facelifted car, with revised radiator grille, tail lights, interior trim and colours.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_hg.htm | title = Holden HG | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref> The HG's major selling point was the introduction of the new Tri-Matic three-speed automatic transmission, which Holden commenced manufacturing at their [[Woodville, South Australia]] factory in 1969.

Despite the arrival of serious competitors in the 1960s, namely the [[Ford Falcon]], [[Chrysler Valiant]] and the introduction of [[Japan]]ese cars, Holden's locally-produced large six- and eight-cylinder cars remained Australia's top-selling vehicles throughout the 1960s. Sales were boosted in exports, with the [[Holden Kingswood|Kingswood]] [[sedan]], [[station wagon]] and utility body styles ([[coupe utility]] and [[pickup truck]]) were exported and assembled abroad to places such as [[New Zealand]], [[Indonesia]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] along with [[South Africa]] where the vehicles were badged as the [[Chevrolet Kommando]].<ref name = "heritage1"/>

[[Image:Holdentorana1971.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Holden Torana|Torana]] was Holden's first [[compact car]], and had its origins in the British [[Vauxhall Viva]]s of the mid-1960s.]]

====Torana: the compact car====
{{main|Holden Torana}}
The [[Holden Torana]] was Holden's first offering of the [[compact car]] — a market that was dominated by Japanese models from various marques. Introduced in 1967, the Torana was initially based on the British HB series [[Vauxhall Viva]]. The name 'Torana' is an [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] word meaning 'to fly'.<ref name = "Torana">{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_torana.htm | title = Holden Torana | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref>

From 1964, Holden had assembled the HA series [[Vauxhall Viva]], marketing the car as "Viva - the GMH small car" (de-emphasising the [[Vauxhall]] brand). The first Torana, the HB, replaced the [[Vauxhall Viva]] in 1967, and Holden offered a new Torana: the LC in 1969, with distinctive new styling. This was the first compact six-cylinder car in the Australian marketplace, and it inspired a new category of cars on Australian roads.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_torana_lc.htm | title = Holden Torana LC | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref> LC Torana won the 1969 ''[[Wheels Car of the Year]]'' award, and won numerous awards on the racetrack and in rallies around Australia. The face-lifted LJ series followed the LC, in early 1972.<ref name = "Torana"/>

The next development of the Torana was the LH series, which was introduced in 1974.<ref name = "LH">{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_torana_lh.htm | title = Holden Torana LH | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref> The LH was offered as a four-door sedan only, with a three-door hatchback variant added in the superseding LX series (manufactured between 1976 and 1978). The LH and LX series were offered with a wide range of engine choices, ranging from a 1.9&nbsp;litre four-cylinder, a 2.8&nbsp;litre and 3.3&nbsp;litre six-cylinder or 4.2&nbsp;litre and 5.0&nbsp;litre eight-cylinder engines.<ref name = "LH"/> At the time, Torana was the only car in the world to be offered with such a differing choice of engines (although the [[Chevrolet Nova]] offered this choice in the 1960s). The four-cylinder Torana, later became the [[Holden Sunbird]], which lived a six year lifespan from 1974–1980,<ref name = "LH"/> and the UC series, which followed the LX in 1978, saw the demise of the V8 engine range.

The Torana departed from Holden's line-up in 1979, followed soon by the Sunbird in 1980. After the 1978 introduction of the [[Holden Commodore]], the Torana became the "in between" car, squeezed out by the smaller and more economical Gemini and the larger, more sophisticated Commodore. The closest successor to the Torana was the [[Holden Camira]], released in 1982. This was Australia's version of GM's medium-sized international "[[GM J platform|J-Car]]".<ref name = "AutoBiography">{{cite book | last = Robinson | first = Peter L. | title = AutoBiography | url = http://www.focus.com.au/ProductDetails.asp?ProdID=64 | publisher = Focus Publishing | year = 2006 | pages = 18–29 | isbn = 1921156104}}</ref> Bodywork for the Camira station wagon was engineered in Australia, and the wagon pressings were exported to the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Vauxhall Cavalier]] estate car.<ref name = "heritage1"/>

===1970s: from "Australia's Own" to the "World Car"===
The 1970s opened with the launch of the new HQ series, often considered the most important new model since the original [[Holden 48-215]].<ref name = "heritage2"/> When HQ was introduced, Holden produced all of its range of passenger cars in Australia, and every model in the range was a unique Australian design. However, by the end of the decade, Holden was in transition, producing cars based on overseas designs.

[[Image:Holden VB commodore 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]] quickly followed the success of the [[Holden Kingswood|Kingswood]], and is Holden's bestselling vehicle to date.]]

HQ was thoroughly re-engineered, featuring a perimeter frame and semi-monocoque construction. This provided a level of refinement not seen in this class of vehicle before. Other firsts included wide 60&nbsp;[[inch]] (1500&nbsp;mm) track, all coil suspension, an extended wheelbase for station wagons, utilities and [[panel van]]s, and a new prestige marque: [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman]], which like the station wagons and utilities, had the benefit of the longer wheelbase.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/holden_HQ_technical_specifications.htm | title = Holden HQ Technical Specifications | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref> The HQ framework spawned a new generation of two-door [[Holden Monaro|Monaros]].<ref name = "heritage2"/> Despite the introduction of the [[Ford Falcon]] and [[Chrysler Valiant]], the HQ remained at the top of the sales charts.

In 1975, Holden introduced the [[Holden Gemini|Gemini]], the Australian version of the "[[GM T platform|T-Car]]",<ref name = "heritage2"/> based on the [[Opel Kadett]] C.<ref name = "TX">{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_gemini_tx.htm | title = Holden Gemini TX | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-11}}</ref> Not only was Gemini an overseas design, but it was developed jointly with [[Isuzu]], GM's Japanese affiliate.<ref name = "TX"/> This was recognised with a badge on the rear of the car stating it was a "Holden-Isuzu". The new car was powered by the Isuzu 1.6&nbsp;litre four-cylinder engine,<ref name = "TX"/> and styling was based on the that of the Kadett, with several changes, including a new radiator grille, more substantial bumpers, different tail lights and a different dashboard. The Gemini fast became a popular car, and rapidly attained sales leadership in its class. The Gemini was awarded the ''[[Wheels Car of the Year]]'' award in 1975,<ref name = "TX"/> and the nameplate continued production until 1987.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_gemini_rb.htm | title = Holden Gemini RB | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-11}}</ref>

Holden's most popular car to date the [[Holden Commodore]], was first seen in 1978 with the introduction of the [[Holden VB Commodore|VB Commodore]].<ref name = "AutoBiography"/> Holden's new family car was loosely based on the [[Opel Rekord]] E bodyshell, but with the front grafted on from the [[Opel Senator]] to accommodate the larger Holden six-cylinder and [[V8 engine]]s. Initially, Commodore maintained Holden's sales leadership in Australia.<ref name = "AutoBiography"/> However, some of the compromises resulting from the adoption of a design intended for another market hampered Commodore's acceptance. In particular, Commodore was narrower than its predecessor and the Falcon rival, which meant that it was less accommodating for three rear seat passengers. The Commodore was perceived as being smaller than Falcon, which costed Holden sales. The width problem was not resolved until the introduction of the wider [[Holden VN Commodore|VN Commodore]] in 1988, which became the first [[Full-size car|full-size]] Commodore.<ref name = "AutoBiography"/>

[[Image:Holden LG Nova 01.jpg|thumb|left|The Holden-[[Toyota]] alliance, saw Holden adopt badge engineered Toyotas and vice versa. The [[Toyota Corolla]] and [[Toyota Camry|Camry]] models were sold as the [[Holden Nova]] ''(pictured)'', and [[Holden Apollo|Apollo]] respectively.]]

===1980s: toughest decade===
The 1980s were a challenging time for Holden, with the Australian car industry experiencing difficulties. The [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] intervened to endeavour to revive the industry, with the establishment of the [[Button car plan]], named after [[John Button]] the Federal Industry Minister. The Button car plan aimed to improve viability by encouraging the industry to focus on producing larger (and more economic) volumes of fewer models, as well as providing incentives for exports.<ref>{{cite web | last = Christie | first = Don | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3165/is_n9_v26/ai_8945968 | title = Automakers want to unbutton Australia - Sen.

Holden experienced financial challenges as profitability fell in the face of declining sales of the [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]] and [[Holden Gemini|Gemini]] models. The competition from [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] intensified, with the popular new [[Ford Laser|Laser]], a compact car based on the [[Mazda 323]], and their updated [[Ford Falcon|Falcon]]. Also, other Australian manufacturers; [[Toyota]], [[Nissan]] and [[Mitsubishi Motors]] were gaining market share.<ref>{{cite web | last = Kenwright | first = Joe | url = http://editorial.carsales.com.au/car-review/1916079.aspx | title = Crossing the Lion (July 2006) | publisher = carsales.com.au Limited | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref>

Holden released the [[Holden Camira|Camira]] in 1982, which was Holden's version of the "[[GM J platform|J-Car]]". After a good sales start, Camira sales faltered, as buyers considered the 1.6&nbsp;litre engine to have inadequate power, and the car's reputation was tarnished by below average build and ride quality problems.<ref name = "AutoBiography"/>

In 1985, Holden's parent, General Motors reorganised and recapitalised the business. At this time, the engine manufacturing and car manufacturing divisions were separated. The engine manufacturing business was successful, building four-cylinder [[GM Family II engine]]s for use in cars built overseas.<ref name = "AutoBiography"/> Holden became the source of engines for the [[Vauxhall Cavalier]] and the [[Opel Ascona]] built in Europe. The [[Holden Barina|Barina]] [[Supermini car|supermini]] was launched in 1985, becoming Holden's first truly small car.<ref name = "heritage2"/> This was a rebadged [[Suzuki Swift]], which allowed Holden to broadening their market appeal.<ref>{{cite web | last = Kennedy | first = Ewan | url = http://www.marque.com.au/usedcars/060306_Suzuki_Swift.htm | title = Suzuki Swift 1985-1999 | publisher = Marque Publishing Company | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref>

An alliance was made with [[Nissan]], which saw Holden offer a rebadged [[Nissan Pulsar|Pulsar]] hatchback in 1985 as the [[Holden Astra]].<ref name = "heritage2"><ref>{{cite web | last = Kennedy | first = Ewan | date = [[2006-09-18]] | url = http://www.marque.com.au/usedcars/060918_Holden_Astra.htm | title = Nissan Pulsar 1996-2006 | publisher = Marque Publishing Company | accessdate = 2007-05-11}}</ref> When Nissan released a new model Pulsar (with an Astra clone) in 1987,<ref name = "heritage2"/> it was powered by the GM Family II engine which powered the Camira.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_camira_jb.htm | title = Holden Camira JB | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-11}}</ref> This arrangement ceased in 1988,<ref name = "IOSC">{{cite book | last = Earl | first = Peter E. | title = Information, Opportunism and Economic Coordination | publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing | year = 2002 | pages = 24–28 | isbn = 1840647388}}</ref> when Holden entered a new alliance with [[Toyota]].

The 1984 [[Holden VK Commodore|VK series Commodore]], featured new models within the range: the Executive, Berlina and Calais.<ref name = "heritage2"/> The styling was significantly changed from the previous [[Holden VH Commodore|VH]] with the adoption of the [[Opel Senator]] roofline with an additional side window. The next update for the Commodore appeared in 1986 with the [[Holden VL Commodore|VL series]], which had new front and rear styling.<ref name = "heritage2"/> Controversially, the VL was powered by the [[Nissan RB engine|Nissan RB30]] 3.0&nbsp;litre six-cylinder engine, and electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. The change to the Nissan engine was necessitated by the legal requirement that all new cars sold in Australia from 1986 had to run on unleaded petrol. It was not feasible to convert Holden's six-cylinder engine to run on unleaded fuel, and the Nissan engine was chosen as representing the best engine available. However, due to the changing exchange rates over the life of the VL, the cost of the Nissan engines doubled.<ref name = "AutoBiography"/>

The final phase in the Commodore recovery strategy was the 1988 introduction of the [[Holden VN Commodore|VN Commodore]], which was significantly wider and significantly redesigned. The VN was powered by the American built 3.8&nbsp;litre [[Buick V6 engine]]. The second generation Commodore continued with success well throughout the 1990s.<ref name = "heritage2"/>

===1990s: comeback years===
This decade saw Holden's transformation continue. By the end of the decade, Holden was a confident and successful participant in the Australian car industry, as well as having a place on the world automotive stage. Besides manufacturing Australia's bestselling car- still the [[Holden Commodore]], which was exported in significant numbers. Many of the Holden's locally produced engines, continued to be were sent abroad to power cars made outside of Australia. In this decade, Holden adopted a new trend, where they imported a range of cars to allowing them to offer a full range of competitive vehicles.<ref>{{cite web | url =

In 1990 Holden revitalised wide-body Commodore, which was significantly more successful than its predecessor. The defunct [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman]] brand was reintroduced, however the modles were sold as the [[Holden Statesman]] and [[Holden Caprice|Caprice]] respectively. As well as the prestige long-wheelbase models, the Ute made a welcome return.<ref name = "AutoBiography"/> Local production of the [[Buick]] sourced [[Buick V6 engine|3.8&nbsp;litre V6 engine]] commenced to provide power for the Commodore range. The 5.0&nbsp;litre V8 engine continued to be available until it was replaced in 1999.<ref name = "heritage3">{{cite web | url = http://media.gmcanada.com:8221/aus/holden/en/company/history/HH13Part3.pdf | title = The Holden Heritage - 13th Edition, part three | publisher = GM Holden Ltd | accessdate = 2007-05-09}}</ref> Strong Commodore sales were contributed by the fact that [[Ford]] had numerous problems with their new [[Ford EA Falcon|EA Falcon]] which they introduced in 1988.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[1999-02-26]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=8330&vf=24 | title = Used car test - Ford Fairlane | publisher = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | accessdate = 2007-05-14}}</ref>

The UAAI "badge engineered" cars offered by each of Holden and Toyota fared poorly (although the Holden Commodore, [[Toyota Camry]] and [[Toyota Corolla|Corolla]] were all successful when sold under their original nameplates). Potential customers could see the "copies" were thinly disguised versions of popular cars, and instead purchased the vehicles from the original manufacturer.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/60DB5F93CC0B207FCA256D21001310D6 | title = Car review - Holden Nova 5-dr hatch | publisher = GoAuto | accessdate = 2007-05-13}}</ref> In 1996, UAAI was dissolved,<ref name = "AutoBiography"/> and Holden recommenced sourcing product offerings from within GM rather than from competitors. The Toyota sourced [[Holden Nova|Nova]] and [[Holden Apollo|Apollo]] were replaced with the [[Holden Astra]] and [[Holden Vectra|Vectra]], which imported from [[Opel]] in [[Europe]]. Assembly of Vectra commenced at [[Elizabeth, South Australia]] and these cars were exported to [[Japan]] and [[South America]]. However, Vectra did not achieve sufficient sales in Australia to justify local assembly, and it reverted to being fully imported in 1999.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/8FECAC2A36315B23CA256D65001A367C | title = Car review - Holden Vectra CDXi 5-dr hatch | publisher = GoAuto | accessdate = 2007-05-13}}</ref> The [[Holden Barina]], which was sourced from [[Suzuki]] in Japan was updated and replaced by the Holden-badged [[Opel Corsa]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/D928D7E37EE64519CA256D210003F9D7 | title = Car review - Holden Barina Swing 5-dr hatch | publisher = GoAuto | accessdate = 2007-05-13}}</ref>

In August 1997 the all-new [[Holden VT Commodore|VT Commodore]] was introduced. The VT was the outcome of an [[Australian dollar|AU$]]600 million development programme which spanned over half a decade. The new model sported a rounded exterior bodyshell, improved dynamics and many 'firsts' for an Australian-built car. A stronger body structure contributed to gains in crash safety, and in late 1997, just months after its introduction was crowned ''[[Wheels Car of the Year]]''.<ref name = "WheelsVEMag">{{Citation | last = Newton | first = Bruce | last2 = Robinson | first2 = Peter | last3 = McCarthy | first3 = Mike | last4 = McKay | first4 = Peter | title = 2006 Collector's Edition VE Commodore: The Full Story | publisher = [[Australian Consolidated Press]] | journal = [[Wheels magazine]] | pages = 158 | date = October 2006}}</ref>

===2000s: Daewoo and the all-new Commodore===
Holden's trend of importing many of their models from [[Opel]] in [[Germany]] continued throughout the first half of the 2000s. But to increase profitability, Holden has now looked to the GM owned [[GM Daewoo|Daewoo]] in [[South Korea]] for replacements.<ref>{{cite web | last = McKinnon | first = Bill | date = [[2005-11-25]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=10699 | title = Holden Barina | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-05-14}}</ref> Holden had already established close research and design links with Daewoo, with which it provides the large [[Holden Statesman|Statesman]] model. The [[Opel]]-sourced [[Holden Barina]] was replaced by the [[Daewoo Kalos]], which continued to be marketed under the Barina nameplate.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2006-01-14]] | url = http://carsguide.news.com.au/story/0,20384,17835536-27286,00.html | title = New Barina's price calms sentiment | publisher = [[The Courier-Mail]] | accessdate = 2007-03-05}}</ref> The entry-level [[Holden Astra]] Classic was replaced by the Holden Viva, which in turn is based on the [[Daewoo Lacetti]].<ref name = "JF">{{cite web | date = [[2006-10-26]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=10699 | title = Holden Viva Hatch | publisher = [[The Australian]] | accessdate = 2007-05-14}}</ref> However the European-sourced Astra nameplate continued, but was marketed as a more upmarket model, than the Viva.<ref name = "JF"/> In 2006 Holden begun selling the [[Holden Captiva]], a [[Crossover SUV]] which is manufactured by Daewoo with Australian-built versions of the [[Alloytec#Holden 3.2|Alloytec V6 engine]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Stevens | first = Samantha | date = [[2006-10-10]] | url = http://carsguide.news.com.au/story/0,20384,20562133-5003140,00.html | title = Holden Captiva: imported SUV | publisher = [[The Sunday Telegraph]] | accessdate = 2007-05-14}}</ref>

The 1997 [[Holden VT Commodore|VT Commodore]] received it's first major update in 2002 with the [[Holden VY Commodore|VY]],<ref name = "heritage3"/> and in 2006, Holden launched the all-new [[Holden VE Commodore|VE]].<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2006-07-15]] | url = http://www.caradvice.com.au/528/holden-ve-commodore-launch/ | title = Holden VE Commodore Launch | publisher = CarAdvice.com.au Pty Ltd | accessdate = 2007-05-06}}</ref> In the seven years of development, the car came to be Holden's largest and most costly project representing an expenditure exceeding [[Australian dollar|AU$]]1&nbsp;billion,<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2006-07-16]] | url = http://www.caradvice.com.au/529/holden-ve-commodore-launched/ | title = Holden VE Commodore Launched | publisher = CarAdvice.com.au Pty Ltd | accessdate = 2007-05-14}}</ref> and is the first Commodore to be entirely designed and engineered in Australia, as all previous generations had been based on European sourced [[automobile platform|platforms]] from Opel that had been adapted both mechanically and in size for the local market.<ref>{{cite web | last = Butler | first = Glenn | date = [[2006-08-14]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=19276 | title = Holden VE Commodore release | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-05-06}}</ref>

Due to tariffs and exchange rates, various [[Holden Vectra|Vectra]] models were more expensive than the larger [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]] in Australia and New Zealand. This led Holden to replace the European model with [[Holden Epica]] in April 2007. The Epica a [[Mid-size car|mid-size sedan]] imported from South Korea, where it is sold as the [[Daewoo Tosca]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Porter | first = Ian | date = [[2007-01-31]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=23056&vf=1 | title = Tosca sweetens Holden range | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-05-14}}</ref>

==Export markets==
[[Image:2008 Pontiac G8 GT Chicago ShowCar.JPG|thumb|left|The VE Commodore will be sold in the United States as the [[Pontiac G8|G8]] under the [[Pontiac]] nameplate.]]

The Holden Commodore is as popular in [[New Zealand]] (where it has hit the number-one slot in the sales' charts from time to time) as it is in Australia, often being used as police cars. Commodores have also been sold in [[South Africa]], [[Thailand]], and are currently marketed in parts of the [[Middle East]] badged as [[Chevrolet Lumina (Australia)|Chevrolet Luminas]]. In [[Brazil]] badge engineered Commodores are sold as the [[Chevrolet Omega]]. Holden's exports to the Middle East and Brazil were the first [[Driving on the left or right|left-hand drive]] cars built since the 1960s, when Holden sold cars in [[Hawaii]].<ref name = "heritage1"/>

A modified version of the [[Holden Monaro]] (in turn a modified Commodore) has been sold in the [[United States]] as the [[Pontiac GTO]] and its model name through [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] dealerships in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name = "heritage1"/> Vauxhall have announced their plans to sell the HSV Clubsport R8 as the 2007 [[Vauxhall VXR8]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Lumsdon | first = Rory | date = [[2007-05-06]] | url = http://www.autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle/Vauxhall-Concepts/224242/ | title = Vauxhall to import HSV Clubsport R8 | publisher = Haymarket Motoring | accessdate = 2007-05-06}}</ref> Since the late 1990s Holden has exported their luxury [[Holden Statesman|Statesman]] sedan to the Middle East as the [[Chevrolet Caprice (Australia)|Chevrolet Caprice]], and to South Korea as the [[Daewoo Statesman]]. The Statesman is also marketed in [[People's Republic of China|China]], as the [[Buick Royaum]], which will be later replaced by the [[Buick Park Avenue (China)|Buick Park Avenue]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Dornin | first = Tim | date = [[2007-04-11]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleId=37768 | title = WM Statesman derived Buick to be manufactured and sold in China | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-05-13}}</ref> Previous Holden export markets include: [[Brunei]], [[Fiji]], [[Indonesia]], [[Hawaii]] and [[Singapore]].<ref name = "heritage1"/>

GM and Holden confirmed V6 and V8 versions of the Commodore will be exported to the [[United States]] as the 2008 [[Pontiac G8]] to replace the ageing [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], in a deal to last the life cycle of the car.<ref>{{cite web | last = Butler | first = Glenn | date = [[2007-05-06]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=29015 | title = Holden confirms export deal to US | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-05-06}}</ref> 

==Sports vehicles==
Between 1968 and 1976, Holden manufactured, and sold a two-door variant of their [[Full-size car|full-size]] Holden sedan as the [[Holden Monaro|Monaro]], a car popular with the general public and in the hearts of many, even though it did not quite set the sales charts alight. A revived Monaro, based on the [[Holden VT Commodore]], had attracted wide attention since being shown as a [[concept car]] at Australian [[motor show]]s, and drew a large waiting list after it was put into production. The revived Monaro was released in the Australian market in October 2001 and starting with the 2004 model year, the Monaro has been exported to the United States, rebadged as the [[Pontiac GTO]], and the Middle East as the [[Chevrolet Lumina (Australia)|Chevrolet Lumina Coupe]]. It is sold in limited numbers in the United Kingdom as the Vauxhall Monaro.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_monaro.htm | title = Holden Monaro | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | date = [[2005-07-21]] | url = http://www.webwombat.com.au/motoring/news_reports/holden-monaro-cv8-z.htm | title =  Holden Waves Goodbye to Monaro | publisher = WebWombat Pty Ltd | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref>
