The '''Thunder Bay Twins''' were a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Senior hockey|Amateur Senior]] and Professional [[ice hockey]] team from [[Thunder Bay, Ontario|Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. The Twins won five [[Allan Cup]]s as National Senior Champions from 1970 until 1991.

==History==
===Merger===
The Port Arthur Bearcats and the Fort William Beavers were a pair of Senior "A" teams in [[Northwestern Ontario]]'s Thunder Bay Senior A Hockey League.  Very often, these two teams were the only actual teams in the league.

The Beavers dated back to at least the 1950's.  In 1955, the Beavers travelled to [[Kitchener, Ontario]] to challenge the [[Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen Sr. A|Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen]] for the [[Allan Cup]].  The Dutchmen won game one 3-2 and the Beavers evened the series in game two with a 6-4 win.  From that point on the series was controlled by the Dutchmen as they took the next three straight with 6-2, 7-6, and 5-3 victories.

The Bearcats were the namesake of a team that once challenged for the [[Stanley Cup]] and were founded in 1946.  Prior to this, the Port Arthur Shipbuilders challenged for the 1944 Allan Cup.  In [[Quebec City, Quebec]], the Shipbuilders challenged the [[Quebec City Aces]] but were defeated three-games-straight by scores of 6-1, 15-4, and 9-6.

In 1970, the towns of [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]] and [[Port Arthur, Ontario|Port Arthur]] merged and became [[Thunder Bay, Ontario]].  The decision was made to merge the two senior teams as well, resulting in the folding of the Thunder Bay Senior A Hockey League and the creation of the Thunder Bay Twins.

===USHL and the OHA===
The newly created Thunder Bay Twins started in the [[United States|American]] [[United States Hockey League]] in 1970.  Now a Tier I Junior "A" league, the USHL was a Semi-Professional league in the 1970s.

After their final season with the USHL in 1975, the Twins challenged and won the Western Canadian Senior "A" Championship and earned a chance to play for the [[Allan Cup]].  The Allan Cup is awarded to the National Senior Championship.  The Eastern champion and their opponent was the [[Barrie Flyers (1966-1979)|Barrie Flyers]] of the [[OHA Senior A Hockey League (1929-1979)|OHA Senior A Hockey League]].  The Flyers got a foot up on the Twins in game one in Barrie, winning 8-5.  In game two, the Twins evened the series 7-2, just to fall back a game in game three with a 7-4 loss -- both in Barrie.  The series then moved up to Thunder Bay and the Twins caught fire, winning the next three games at home 8-2, 5-2, and 8-4 respectively to win their first national championship.

In 1975, the Thunder Bay Twins decided to join the [[OHA Senior A Hockey League (1929-1979)|OHA Senior A Hockey League]].  The played in the OSAHL until 1979.  In that time, the Twins won two regular season championships and one league playoff title.

===Manitoba Sr. A===
From 1979 until 1986, the Twins played in the Manitoba Senior A Hockey League.  In 1981, the Twins hosted a round robin tournament to determine an Allan Cup champion.  The Twins started off the tournament against the [[Petrolia Squires]], defeating them 8-3.  In game two, they faced the [[Grand Falls Cataracts]] and defeated them 9-4.  In the third and final game of the round robin, the Twins met the [[St. Boniface Mohawks]] and beat them 5-4 in overtime to clinch first place in the round robin.  In the tournament semi-final, something went wrong for the twins.  In their second straight game against the Mohawks, the Twins were shocked 4-3 and eliminated from the tournament despite a 3-1 record.  The Petrolia Squires won the 1981 Allan Cup.

In 1984, the Twins were again Manitoba and Western Canadian champions.  They played host to the [[Cambridge Hornets]] at the [[Fort Williams Gardens]] in a best-of-seven series.  The Twins opened the series squeezing out a 3-2 victory over the Hornets.  Cambridge came back in game two and rocked the Twins 7-3.  After this, the Twins battened down the hatches and fought through a pair of tight wins (5-3, 6-5) to clinch the series in game five with a convincing 6-1 win to clinch the team's second Allan Cup.

In 1985, the Twins repeated as Manitoba and Western champions and found themselves in a best-of-seven marathon with the [[Corner Brook Royals]] in [[Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador|Corner Brook, Newfoundland]].  So far from home, the Twins may have accomplished one of the greatest feats in amateur hockey history.  The Corner Brook Royals crushed the jet lagged Twins 9-5 in game one.  Game two went a little better for the Twins, as they forced overtime but were overpowered by the Royals 3-2.  Game three needed to be won by the Twins, but again they were embarrassed by the Eastern champions 9-5.  With their back against the wall down 3-games-to-none, the Twins began their trek back.  Game four ended with a 4-2 nail biter of a win for the Twins.  Game five saw the Twins embarrass a seemingly deflated Royals squad 8-3.  The twin took game six 2-0 and then finished the comeback with an unbearably close 5-4 victory.  With their third Allan Cup victory, the Twins became the only team in Allan Cup history to comeback from a 3-0 deficit to win the Allan Cup.  As the tournament is now in a round robin format and a revert to best-of-sevens are very unlikely, the feat may never be repeated.

===OHA and back to Manitoba===
In 1986, the Twins moved to the four-team [[OHA Senior A Hockey League]].  After one lackluster season for the Twins, the league folded and the Twins returned to the Manitoba Senior A Hockey League.

The 1987-88 season had the Twins win the Manitoba and Western titles and find themselves in the Allan Cup final again.  Playing at home in the Gardens, the Twins found themselves against a starkly lesser opponent.  The Eastern champions in 1988 were the [[Charlottetown Islanders Sr. A|Charlottetown Islanders]].  The Twins easily swept the Islanders by scores of 7-4, 10-2, 9-3, and 7-1 respectively to win their fourth ever Allan Cup.

The 1989 Allan Cup brought a significant challenge to the Twins.  League champions again, the Twins found themselves in a Allan Cup round robin with three other teams.  In game one of the round robin, the Twins met an old rival in the St. Boniface Mohawks and lost 5-3.  In game two, the Twins met the [[Montreal Team Chomedey]] and defeated them 6-3.  In the final game of the round robin, the Twins met the [[Bassano Hawks]] and defeated soundly 7-1 to clinch second place.  Thunder Bay found themselves in a sudden death semi-final against Montreal for the right to play in the final.  The Twins beat Chomedey 6-3.  The final was set up as a best-of-three games set and was against St. Boniface.  The Twins avenged the 1981 Allan Cup semi-final loss to the Mohawks by defeating them 2-0 and then 4-2 to win their fifth Allan Cup championship.

After winning the 1990-91 Manitoba title and the Western Canadian championship, the Twins found themselves yet again in the Allan Cup final.  The Eastern champion was the Charlottetown Islanders, a team that the Twins had embarrassed in 1988 in a lopsided four-game-sweep.  This time the Islanders came out to return the favour in their own home rink in [[Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island]].  The Islanders won four straight games (5-3, 5-2, 5-4, and 5-4 in overtime) to kill the Twins dream of a sixth Allan Cup.

===The end===
That summer, the [[Colonial Hockey League]] announced plans to expand to the city of [[Thunder Bay, Ontario]].  The Twins made way for the Semi-Professional [[Thunder Bay Thunder Hawks]] who began play in the 1991-92 season.  Senior glory would not return to the city of Thunder Bay until the creation of the [[Thunder Bay Bombers]] many years later.

The 1974-75 Thunder Bay Twins were inducted into the Northwestern Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1987.
