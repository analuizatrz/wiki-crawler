Córdoba participated as a [[mediator]] in the [[Humanitarian exchange]] discussions between the Government of Colombia and the [[FARC]] guerrilla group, along with Venezuelan president [[Hugo Chávez]], but their attempts failed. 

Córdoba is currently under investigations by the [[Supreme Court of Colombia|Supreme Court]] for [[treason]], under Colombian law, after making controversial declarations in Mexico City and with her clear ties with the infamous terrorist group "Farc". 

==Early years==

Córdoba was born in [[Medellín]], [[Antioquia]] to Zabulón Córdoba (brother of political leader of the [[Choco Department|Department of Chocó]]  [[Diego Luis Córdoba]]) and Lía Ruiz. She studied at the [[Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana]] in Medellín, graduating as a lawyer. Later she specialized in Marketing at the [[Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana]]. 

==Political Career==

Córdoba started her political carrier in Medellin working as a community leader in many neighborhoods  along political leader [[William Jaramillo]]. Between 1984 and 1986 Córdoba was appointed to her first public office job, working as a municipal sub-controller. In 1986, Jaramillo, her mentor is elected [[mayor of Medellín]] and later appointed her as Private Secretary. 

===Councilwoman of Medellín===

In 1988 Córdoba was democratically elected as [[Council of Medellin|Councilwoman of Medellín]] for a period of two years. 

===Department Assembly of Antioquia===

In 1990 Cordoba postulated her name as candidate for the [[Chamber of Representatives of Colombia]] but did not get enough votes to become elected. A few months later after the congressional elections Cordoba ran for deputy of the Antioquia Department Assembly, this time getting elected.

===Chamber of Representatives 1992===

After the [[Constituent Assembly of Colombia]] adopted the new [[Colombian Constitution of 1991|Constitution of 1991]], Córdoba ran for congress once again for the Chamber of Representatives for the period 1992-1994. In 1994 her political mentor William Jaramillo announced that he was not going to seek a reelection and Córdoba assumed his role. She was elected to the Senate for the 1994-1998 period receiving most of her votes from the [[Departments of Colombia|Departments]] of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] and [[Choco Department|Choco]].  

Córdoba became one of the most notorious figures of the Latin American feminist movement in Colombia. She made part of the popular inter-parliamentary group that promotes government policies on [[sexuality]]. In 1995, Córdoba participated in the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in [[Beijing]], [[PRC|China]].

===Senator of Colombia 1998===

Through congress Córdoba became nationally known  due to her common controversial and radical belligerent positions. In 1998 Córdoba was reelected as senator. She promoted debates focused on minorities and communitarian mothers groups, the resolution of the [[Colombian armed conflict]] through talk negotiations. 

;Kidnapping

In 1999 [[Carlos Castano]] leader of the paramilitary group [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia]] (AUC) kidnapped Senator Córdoba. After numerous weeks she was freed and exiled with her family in [[Canada]]. After a few months in exile and reports by Colombian authorities that security had improved, Cordoba returned to Colombia, leaving her family back and continue her political duties. She was victim of two assassination attempts.

===Senator of Colombia 2002===

;Death threats and political ban through coercion

In the elections of 2002, the regions where Córdoba had traditionally received strong voting results like Medellín, Choco and [[Cauca Department|Cauca]] were being coerced by the AUC paramilitary group. Despite this Cordoba was elected once again for congress this time also obtaining strong voting results in the capital, [[Bogotá]]. She almost didn't make the cut to be a congresswoman again.

;Corruption debates and lost of seat in Congress

In 2003, once again in congress Córdoba was involved in debates on corruption promoted by the [[Ministry of the Interior and Justice|minister of the Interior and Justice]], [[Fernando Londoño Hoyos]]. After this debate in May, her positive image increased and was elected with the highest turnout ever in that party as [[President of the Liberal National Directorate]] (head of the Colombia liberal party). 

In 2005, the Council of State of Colombia modified the electoral results of 2002 after proving there had been an electoral fraud in [[Valle del Cauca Department|Valle del Cauca]] and [[Atlantico Department|Atlántico]]. The new results left Córdoba out of congress. She then promoted the leftist radical wing of the Colombian Liberal party to prevent the party from moving towards the political current of conservatism and officialism led by President [[Álvaro Uribe]]. 

;Citizens power 21st century political movement

For this reason she founded the ''[[Poder Ciudadano Siglo XXI]]'' political movement as an internal dissidence of the Liberal party. In the [[Colombian legislative election, 2006|legislative elections of 2006]] Córdoba's political movement did not get a high voting turnout; however, she was elected once again to the senate.

She had previously worked on the Third Commission which deals with Financial affairs, the Fifth Commission which deals with Mining and Energy and the Second Commission which debated topics related to Foreign Affairs. Córdoba was also president of the Senate's Human Rights Commission and the Peace Commission. As congresswoman she has supported projects that focused mainly on "communitary mothers", women head of households, Afro-Colombian communities, [[LGBT in Colombia|LGBT groups]], groups against family violence and corruption.

====Controversy in Mexico====

On [[March 11]], [[2007]], Córdoba assisted a symposium in [[Mexico City]] called ''Los Partidos Políticos y una Nueva Ciudad'' (Political parties and a new city) which was supported by guerrilla groups from Colombia, the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC) and the [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|National Liberation Army]] (ELN), both considered terrorist organizations by the US government and the European Union. Córdoba generated controversy after saying "the progressive governments of Latin America should interrupt diplomatic relations with Colombia" and also mentioned that the "government of [President] [[Álvaro Uribe]] lacked legitimacy".<ref>Élber Gutiérrez Roa, [http://www.semana.com/wf_InfoArticulo.aspx?idArt=101537  Declaraciones de Piedad Córdoba en México profundizan diferencias con el Partido Liberal], ''[[Revista Semana]]'', March 13, 2007</ref>

The [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) deployed electoral observers. In a statement of [[May 28]], the OAS said that the elections "have taken place in an atmosphere of freedom, transparency and normalcy", despite incidents "related to the use of indelible ink, voter substitution and the accreditation of electoral witnesses, though these have no effect on the electoral process as a whole" and "developments in northern Santander province that took the lives of army personnel and left others injured in an ambush carried out by subversive groups."<ref>[http://www.oas.org/OASpage/press_releases/press_release.asp?sCodigo=EOM-CO-03 OAS Observation Mission: Colombian Elections Transparent, Normal], [[Organization of American States]], [[28 May]] [[2006]]. Accessed 4 April 2007.</ref>

==== Humanitarian exchange negotiator ====

{{main|Humanitarian exchange}}

On [[August 16]], [[2007]], President Uribe in a surprising move appointed Córdoba as negotiator in the [[humanitarian exchange]] in an effort negotiate the freedom of some 50 hostages held by FARC and the possible release of some 500 guerrillas imprisoned by the government.<ref>[http://www.analitica.com/mujeranalitica/noticias/3497120.asp {{es icon}} Analitica: Colombia: Uribe nombra senadora cercana a Chávez como facilitadora ante FARC]</ref> Córdoba then asked the [[President of Venezuela]] [[Hugo Chávez]] to mediate also, with the support of President Uribe. 

Córdoba then interned in the jungles of Colombia and met with alias [[Raul Reyes]], spokesman and leader of the FARC, to coordinate a meeting with president Chávez in Venezuela.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2007/09/17/elmundo/i-02501.htm {{es icon}} Clarín: Las FARC se reúnen en la selva con la mediadora]</ref> In Venezuela, Chávez and Córdoba met with [[Rodrigo Granda]] and [[Ivan Marquez]] among other members of the guerrilla as part of the negotiations. Photos of Cordoba and the guerrillas surfaced in an online website called ''Agencia Bolivariana de Prensa'' (ABP) which showed Córdoba in an amicable and cordial relationship with the FARC, receveing flowers, kisses and hugs. This generated controversy among the government and its supporters.<ref>[http://www.europapress.es/00407/20071112211642/colombia-revelan-imagenes-encuentro-senadora-colombiana-piedad-cordoba-delegados-farc.html {{es icon}} europress.es: senadora colombiana Piedad Córdoba y delegados de las FARC]</ref>, to which she responded that the photos "were taken out of context".

Córdoba has repeatedly accused President [[Álvaro Uribe]], Minister of Defense [[Juan Manuel Santos]], the [[Colombian Armed Forces]] and the [[US government]] of undermining the humanitarian exchange process by enforcing military and police action over the territory presumably used for the transportation and release of the hostages, this accusation has been denied by the government and no factual prove or testimony has surfaced so far confirming this serious accusation.

On [[December 20]], [[2007]], Córdoba accused a "Top Colombian government official", of orchestrating an assassination attempt towards her on Venezuelan soil; this accusation sparked a confrontation with the ministry of defense who has been accused by Córdoba of similar allegations before. So far no proof or testimony about the alleged conspiracy is known. <ref> Santos dice que Piedad lo acusa en voz baja, ella se declara sorprendida, http://www.eltiempo.com/tiempoimpreso/edicionimpresa/politica/2007-12-21/ARTICULO-WEB-NOTA_INTERIOR-3868897.html</ref>
