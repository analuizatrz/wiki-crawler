[[Image:Waterhouse_a_mermaid.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''A Mermaid'' by [[John William Waterhouse]].]]
A '''mermaid''' (from the [[Middle English]] ''mere'' in the obsolete sense 'sea' + ''maid(en)'') is a [[legendary creature|legendary]] aquatic creature with the head and torso of human female and the tail of a fish. The male version of a mermaid is called a [[merman]]; the gender-neutral plural is ''merfolk''. Various cultures throughout the world have similar figures.  They were known to sing sailors to their deaths, like the [[Siren]], or squeeze the life out of drowning men, while trying to rescue them. 

The [[Siren]]s of [[Greek mythology]] are sometimes portrayed in later [[folklore]] as mermaids; in fact in some languages the name ''sirena'' is used interchangeably for both creatures. Other related types of [[mythology|mythical]] or [[legend]]ary creature are [[water fairies]] (e.g. various [[Nymph|water nymphs]]) and [[selkie]]s.
==Legend and myth==
[[Image:1921MermaidLegs.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A mermaid looks up at the legs of a swimmer; 1921 cartoon]]It has been widely suggested or implied that [[manatee]]s or [[dugong]]s could be behind the myth of the mermaid. These large aquatic [[mammal]]s are notable for the way in which they carry their young, cradled in their arms much as a human would carry a baby. It is possible that sailors seeing these unfamiliar beasts for the first time, would assume that they had in fact stumbled across some sort of [[humanoid]] species, and consequently spread their accounts of the sightings through their homelands on their return from voyages. It has even been posited that the traditional image of a mermaid with long flowing hair could be attributed to manatees breaking the ocean surface underneath patches of [[seaweed]], and giving the unfamiliar observer the impression of having long hair.

=== Ancient Near East ===

Tales of mermaids are nearly universal. The first known mermaid [[folklore|stories]] appeared in [[Assyria]], ca. [[1000s BCE|1000 BCE]]. [[Atargatis]], the mother of Assyrian queen [[Semiramis]], was a goddess who loved a mortal shepherd and in the process killed him. Ashamed, she jumped into a lake to take the form of a fish, but the waters would not conceal her divine nature. Thereafter, she took the form of a mermaid &mdash; human above the waist, fish below &mdash; though the earliest representations of Atargatis showed her as being a fish with a human head and legs, similar to the [[Babylonia|Babylonian]] [[Enki|Ea]]. The Greeks recognized Atargatis under the name Derketo, where she was often [[wiktionary:conflate|conflated]] with [[Aphrodite]].

Prior to 546 B.C., the Milesian philosopher [[Anaximander]] proposed that mankind had sprung from an aquatic species of animal. He thought that man with his extended [[infancy]] could not have survived, originally, in the manner he does presently. This idea does not appear to have survived Anaximander's death.

A popular Greek legend has [[Alexander the Great]]'s sister, [[Thessalonice of Macedon|Thessalonike]], turn into a mermaid after her death.<ref> [http://www.mpt.org/programsinterests/mpt/alexander/guide/teachers_guide.pdf Teacher's Guide]</ref> She lived, it was said, in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and when sailors would encounter her, she would ask them only one question: ''"Is Alexander the king alive?"'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''Ζει ο βασιλιάς Αλέξανδρος''), to which the correct answer would be ''"He lives and still rules"'' (Greek: ''Ζει και βασιλεύει''). Any other answer would spur her into a rage, where she transformed into a [[Gorgon]] and meant doom for the ship and every sailor onboard.

[[Lucian|Lucian of Samosata]] in [[Syria]] (2nd century CE) in ''De Dea Syria'' ("Concerning the Syrian Goddess") wrote of the Syrian temples he had visited:
:"Among them - Now that is the traditional story among them concerning the temple. But other men swear that Semiramis of [[Babylonia]], whose deeds are many in Asia, also founded this site, and not for Hera [[Atargatis]] but for her own Mother, whose name was [[Atargatis|Derketo]]"
:"I saw the likeness of Derketo in [[Phoenicia]], a strange marvel. It is woman for half its length, but the other half, from thighs to feet, stretched out in a fish's tail. But the image in [[Jerusalem|the Holy City]] is entirely a woman, and the grounds for their account are not very clear. They consider fishes to be sacred, and they never eat them; and though they eat all other fowls, they do not eat the dove, for she is holy so they believe. And these things are done, they believe, because of Derketo and [[Semiramis]], the first because Derketo has the shape of a fish, and the other because ultimately Semiramis turned into a [[dove]]. Well, I may grant that the temple was a work of Semiramis perhaps; but that it belongs to Derketo I do not believe in any way. For among the [[Egyptians]], some people do not eat fish, and that is not done to honor Derketo." <ref>Lucian of Samosata, ''De Dea Syria'' Part 2, Chapter 14</ref>

===British===
Mermaids were noted in British folklore as both omnious, foretelling disaster, and provoking it.  Some were described as monstrous in size, up to 160 feet.<ref>Katharine Briggs, ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures'', "Mermaids", p 287. ISBN 0-394-73467-X</ref>

Mermaids could also swim up rivers to freshwater lakes.  One day, in a lake near his house, the Laird of Lorntie saw, as he thought, a woman drowning, and went to aid her; a servant of his pulled him back, warning that it was a mermaid, and the mermaid screamed after that she would have killed him if it were not for his servant.<ref>K. M. Briggs, ''The Fairies in English Tradition and Literature'', p 57 University of Chicago Press, London, 1967</ref>

On occasion, mermaids could be more beneficient, giving humans means of cure.<ref>Katharine Briggs, ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures'', "Mermaids", p 288. ISBN 0-394-73467-X</ref>

Some tales raised the question of whether mermaids had immortal souls to answer it in the negative.<ref>Katharine Briggs, ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures'', "Mermaids", p 289.

ISBN 0-394-73467-X</ref>

Mermen were also noted, as wilder and uglier than mermaids, but they were described as having little interest in humans.<ref>Katharine Briggs,

Also, some people claim they have seen dead or living mermaids in places like [[Scotland]], [[Malaysia]] and [[British Columbia]]. Two most recent Canadian sightings took place in the [[Straight of Georgia]]. [http://www.tourismvictoria.com/Content/EN/747.asp],

===Literature===
[[Image:The_Little_Mermaid_4.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The statue of [[The Little Mermaid]], a monument to [[Hans Christian Andersen]], in [[Copenhagen]] harbour.]]

Mermaids are one of the most famous creatures of [[popular culture]], and are depicted regularly in literature and film. This is likely due to the influence of [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s [[fairytale]] ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' ([[1836]]), which has been translated into many languages.  Andersen's portrayal, immortalized with a famous bronze sculpture in [[Copenhagen]] harbour, has arguably become the standard and has influenced most modern Western depictions of mermaids since it was published.  The story has been retold in other films and television programs, and regularly features in collections of fairytales.  It has been adapted into various media, the most famous of which is the [[1989]] [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|movie of the same name]].

[[L. Frank Baum]] (creator of [[Land of Oz|Oz]]) wrote a novel about merfolk, ''[[The Sea Fairies]]''.

Mermaids appear in the [[Peter Pan]] novel and in adaptations of it (such as the film ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'') and the [[Harry Potter]] series, specifically in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''.

Many mermaids appear in works of fantasy fiction, including [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''The Merman's Children''.<ref>John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Mermaids" p 639 ISBN 0-312-19869-8</ref>

The [[comic book]] [[superhero]] ''[[Superman]]'' had a romantic love interest with a mermaid named [[Lori Lemaris]]. The name Lori Lemaris was probably drawn from [[Lorelei]] rock in the [[Rhine]] added to ''maris'', from the [[Latin]] ''mare'', meaning ocean.

''[[Aquamarine (film)|Aquamarine]]'', a novel by [[Alice Hoffman]], is about two 13 year old girls who discover a sassy teenage mermaid.  The novel was popular among teen and preteen girls.  The novel was made in to a film released in [[2006]] by Twentieth Century Fox and starred [[Sara Paxton]], [[Emma Roberts]] and [[JoJo]].

Mermaids are also fictional creatures in ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' games. They are the females of the [[Merfolk (Dungeons & Dragons)|merfolk]] race. The males are known as [[Merman|mermen]].

===Film===
''[[Miranda (1948 film)|Miranda]]'' ([[1948 in film|1948]]), starring [[Glynis Johns]], is another popular film to feature a mermaid. This film was followed by a sequel, ''Mad About Men'' (1954). 

''[[Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid]]'' (1948) starring [[Ann Blyth]], was another variation on the theme.

[[Image:Mermaidtwo.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Madison, the mermaid from the movie ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]''.]]
In ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]'' ([[1984]]), starring [[Daryl Hannah]] and [[Tom Hanks]], Hannah played a mermaid who fell in love with a man. She could walk dry land as a human female, but whenever water touched her legs they changed into a fish-tail. Much of the movie revolves around her humorous attempts to conceal her true identity from her lover. A made-for-television sequel, ''[[Splash, Too]]''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096159/</ref> followed in [[1988]]. It starred [[Amy Yasbeck]] and [[Todd Waring]].  

In ''[[Local Hero]]'' (1984), Marina ([[Jenny Seagrove]]) is suspected by her love interest of being a mermaid. 

[[Image:Ar-iel.JPG|200px|right]]
[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)]] is a movie produced by [[Walt Disney Studios]] which portrays a variant of the story by [[Hans Christian Anderson]] about the mermaid that wished for legs.

''[[She Creature]]'' (2001) featured a villainous mermaid who seemed to have a taste for human flesh and [[lesbian]] tendencies.

[http://www.maddogz.com.au Maddogz Productions] produced the 2006 short film [http://heartsatlantis.maddogz.com.au/ "Heart's Atlantis"] which features a beautiful mermaid. It tells the story of a grieving young boy who finds solitude in a mermaid in his backyard pool. Hannahh Fraser plays the mermaid, with Sam Wallis and Ty Hungerford also starring in the film. The tail in the film was created by ''H2O Just Add Water'' and ''Aquamarine'' prosthetic designer Jason Baird of [http://www.jmbfxstudio.com.au JMB FX Studio].

In "[[Aquamarine]]" (2006), two young girls (13), Claire and Hailey, befriend a mermaid by the name of Aquamarine. They soon begin a quest to help her win a boy working at Claire's Grandparents' beach club, Raymond.

== Music ==
'''Mermaid Music'''
Mermaids have long been associated with [[music]], and much like that of [[Orpheus]], the power of their singing voices had the ability to enthrall.
Along with their legendary vanity, the hair-combing and mirrors, the association of mermaids with music is coupled with another association of a vocal nature: they are said to be able to confer verbal eloquence, much like the Muses of the ancient [[Greek myths]].
Mermaids and other mers are associated with many attributes and assigned different themes around the world, of course, but of the half-human, half-other type of animal creations of lore, the mermaid seems to have survived at least in the West, more ably than other chimerical mythic beings.
The fact that the mers have fish tails is significant, and points to our ancient origins as denizens of the deep, and the nature of the mystical and mysterious fathoms have given rise to symbolism of these sea people in our concept of the subconscious realms.
Standing in usually for the mysteries of female sexuality and for the libertine behavior most myths ascribed to the wild women of the seas, so, too, was the music made by mermaids seen as somewhat depraved as well as dangerous.
Forever our imaginations will be stirred by the love and death themes implied by the music of the mers in all their pitiless, heart-breaking vanity.

===Television===
In the fifth season of [[Charmed]], there is a two-parter concerning mermaids; [[A Witch's Tail (Part 1)]] and [[A Witch's Tail (Part 2)]]. The Charmed Ones are drawn to an innocent mermaid who must elicit a proclamation of love from her mortal boyfriend or lose her immortality to a water demon known as the Sea Hag. Determined to save the mermaid, the Charmed Ones cast a spell, unfortunately turning [[Phoebe Halliwell|Pheobe]] into a mermaid. Confused and surprised by [[Cole Turner|Cole's]] unexpected return from the Underworld, Phoebe finds a new sense of independence in the sea and refuses to return to land. Fearing for the life of their sister, [[Paige Matthews|Paige]] seeks out Cole to aid her in returning to normal while [[Piper Halliwell|Piper]] and [[Leo Wyatt|Leo]] try to vanquish both the Sea Hag and the Skeleton Demon.

The television show [[Fantasy Island]] had a mermaid character named Naia, played by [[Michelle Phillips]] of [[the Mamas & the Papas]] in three episodes. 

In the [[Futurama]] episode [[The Deep South (Futurama)|The Deep South]], the crew encounters Mermaids (which evolved from humans) who inhabit the fabled lost city of Atlanta in the year 3000.  The concept of mermaids not having the same reproductive functions as humans in the show is a reference to the [[mermaid problem]]. 

In 1991, manga artist [[Rumiko Takahashi]], creator of ''[[Ranma 1/2]]'', created a three-volume horror manga series called ''[[Mermaid Saga]]'', which was based on the Japanese myth that eating mermaid's flesh can grant immortality.

Animé [[Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch]] and its sequel, [[Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch Pure]] focuses on mermaid princess and their adventures in the human world trying to protect both land and sea creatures.

In [[2003]] the television movie [[Mermaids (2003 film)|Mermaids]] was released. This TV movie starred Sarah Laine, Nikita Ager, and Australian model Erika Heynatz as a trio of mermaid sisters who band together to avenge their father's death.

[[Marina (TV series)|Marina]] was a 2004 TV show from the [[Philippines]] which starred Teleserye Queen (as the mermaid Marina) and Filipino superstar [[Claudine Barretto]].  It was the first fantasy teleserye on [[ABS-CBN]] and became very popular. It first aired in February and ended in November. 

In 2004, [[The Backyardigans]] was a chapter (''Viking Voyage'') where Tasha was a mermaid, and she sings "The Mermaid Song", inspired in the song "The Yellow Rose Of Texas".

[[Image:5e2c.jpg|right|320px|thumb|Claire Holt, Phoebe Tonkin and Cariba Heine as the mermaids from ''H2O: Just Add Water'']]Australian television series, ''[[H2O: Just Add Water]]'' (2006), involves 3 teenage girls who, after encountering a mysterious island grotto, transform into mermaids whenever water touches any part of their bodies.

In [[Power Rangers Mystic Force]], the Blue Ranger turns into the Mermaid Titan.  This is based upon MagiMermaid, the Majin form of MagiBlue in [[Mahō Sentai Magiranger]]

In 2006, NBC's [[soap opera]] ''[[Passions]]'' added a mermaid character named Siren, brought to life by the toddler witch Endora to keep her half-brother's fiance from leaving him.

===Hoaxes===
In the [[19th century]], [[P. T. Barnum]] displayed in his museum a [[taxidermy|taxidermal]] hoax called the ''[[Fiji mermaid|Feejee [''sic''] Mermaid]].'' Others have perpetrated similar hoaxes, which are usually [[papier-mâché]] fabrications or parts of deceased creatures, usually monkeys and fish, stitched together for the appearance of a grotesque mermaid. In the wake of the [[2004 tsunami]], pictures of Fiji "mermaids" were passed around on the internet as something that had washed up amid the devastation, though they were no more real than Barnum's exhibit.<ref>http://www.snopes.com/photos/tsunami/mermaid.asp</ref>

==Artwork==
Perhaps one of the most famous mermaid paintings in the world was created by [[John William Waterhouse]], painted from 1895 to 1905, entitled ''A Mermaid'', (see the top of this article). An example of late British Academy style artwork, the piece debuted to considerable acclaim (and secured Waterhouse's place as a member of the [[Royal Academy]]), but disappeared into a private collection and didn't resurface until the 1970s. It is currently in the collection of [[Lord Lloyd-Webber|Andrew Lloyd Weber]].

===Heraldry===
[[Image:POL Warszawa COA 1.svg|thumb|right|100px|Coat of arms of Warsaw]]
In [[heraldry]], the charge of a mermaid is commonly represented with a comb and a mirror, and blazoned as a 'mermaid in her vanity.' Merfolk were used to symbolize eloquence in speech.

A shield and sword-wielding mermaid (''Syrenka'') is on the official [[Coat of arms of Warsaw]], the capital of [[Poland]].

The personal coat of arms of [[Michaëlle Jean]], Canada's [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], features two [[Simbi]], mermaid-like spirits from [[Haiti]]an [[vodun]], as [[supporters]].

===Advertising===
[[Image:Mermaid-ChickenOfTheSea-sm.png|70px|left]]
A [[cartoon]] mermaid (seen at left) is the [[mascot]] for the [[Chicken of the Sea]] brand of [[tuna]].

The [[Starbucks|Starbucks Coffee]] [[logo]] is a illustrated picture of a siren.

==Sirenomelia==
[[Sirenomelia]], also called "mermaid syndrome", is a rare [[congenital]] [[disease|disorder]] in which a child is born with his or her legs fused together and the [[Sex organ|genitalia]] reduced. This condition is about as rare as [[conjoined twins]] and is usually fatal within a day or two of birth because of [[kidney]] and [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] complications, though there are three known survivors of this disorder alive today.

==Symbolism==
According to [[Dorothy Dinnerstein]]’s book, ''The Mermaid and the Minotaur'', human-animal hybrids such as the minotaur and the mermaid convey the emergent understanding of the ancients that human beings were both one with and different from animals and that, as such, humans' "nature is internally inconsistent, that our continuities with, and our differences from, the earth's other animals are mysterious and profound; and in these continuities, and these differences, lie both a sense of strangeness on earth and the possible key to a way of feeling at home here".<ref name=Dinnerstein>
