The '''American middle class''' is a term whose definition is especially vague.<ref name="Middle class according to The Drum Major Institute for public policy">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/now/politics/middleclassoverview.html|title=Middle class according to The Drum Major Institute for public policy|accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref><ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = | coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, MA| id = 0-205-41365-X}}</ref> There are several ideological and economic theories attempting to define the concept that is the middle class. One may define the middle class as consisting of all those who are neither "[[Poverty in the United States|poor]]" nor "[[Household income in the United States|rich]]" or one may define the middle class as being a relative elite of professionals and managers. These theories vary in exactly how many individuals and households they identify as middle class.<ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class">{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class
 | publisher = Harper Collins | location = New York, NY | id = 0-06-0973331}}</ref> With differing definitions of the middle class, comes a considerable amount of diversity among the defining features of middle class. Typical occupations, influence as well as income and wealth of middle class households vary with the chosen ideology, thus further complicating any attempts at defining the middle class. Sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert, James Henslin, William Thompson and Joseph Hickey have brought forth class models in which the middle class is divided into two section who combined constitute 44% to 49% of the population.<ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = | coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, MA| id = 0-205-41365-X}}</ref><ref name="American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality">{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Dennis | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1997 | title = American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality | publisher = Wadsworth | location = | id = 978-0534505202}}</ref><ref name="Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships">{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Brian | authorlink = | coauthors = Stacey C.

Current surveys results indicate that the vast majority of Americans consider themselves to be members of the middle class;<ref name="Class, A Guide through the American status system">{{cite book | last = Fussel | first = Paul | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 1983 | title = Class, A Guide through the American status system | publisher = Touchstone | location = New York, NY | id = 0-671-79225-3}}</ref> thus indicating that the term middle class is often used to describe those at neither end of the socio-economic strata.<ref name="The Drum Major Institute with one perspective on the middle class">{{cite web|url=http://www.themiddleclass.org/main.cfm?actionId=globalShowStaticContent&screenKey=talking|title=The Drum Major Institute with one perspective on the middle class|accessdate=2006-09-11}}</ref> The problem that arises from the three class system in which the middle class constitutes the majority of the population is that the vast economic and cultural fragmentation among those in the extended middle of the social strata is ignored. The idea of a middle class majority also contradicts leading sociological class models which indicate the exsistence of a non-middle class majority. The term middle class may thus be applied to a professional in the [[Income quintiles|top quintile]] of society as well as a worker in the [[income quintiles|mid quintile]], rendering the term uselessly vague.<ref name="Christian Science Monitor on What is Middle Class">{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0510/p09s01-codc.html|title=Christian Science Monitor on What is Middle Class|accessdate=2006-09-11}}</ref> In response to rising awareness of the inequities among middle class individuals, the American middle class is often divided into three or two sub-sets. In the class models by sociologists Dennis Gilbert, James Henslin, William Thompson and Joseph Hickey the upper middle class consists of highly educated white collar professionals with great job autonomy. The lower middle class consists of so-called "Semi-professionals," who commonly act as the supporting staff of white collar professionals and hold positions in the professional and managerial fields that feature less work autonomy.<ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = | coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, MA| id = 0-205-41365-X}}</ref><ref name="American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality">{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Dennis | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1997 | title = American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality | publisher = Wadsworth | location = | id = 978-0534505202}}</ref><ref name="Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships">{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Brian | authorlink = | coauthors = Stacey C.

As mentioned above another theory attempting to define the vague intellectual concept that is the middle class, states that only professionals and those who would otherwise be considered upper middle class are actually middle class. According to this theory the vast majority of Americans are identified as being working class while the middle class is seen as a modern [[petite bourgeoisie]].<ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class">{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class

==Definitions==
[[Image:Class distribution US.png|thumb|right|300px|America's middle class according to sociologists Dennis Gilbert, James Henslin as well as William Thompson and Joseph Hickey. In all three class system is the middle class divided into two parts, together constituting 47% to 49% of the total population.]]
The two most common definitions of the middle class are either an economically and culturally highly fragmented group including all those who are neither rich nor [[Poverty in the United States|poor]] or that of those individuals with the lifestyle associated with the term middle class.<ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class">{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class

Thus the group containing professionals and management, which author and social critic [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] dubbed the "Professional middle class," is the definition most commonly used by sociologist and political analysts when using lifestyle to define the term middle class.

===The Professional/Managerial Middle Class===
The professional middle class, also called the '''upper middle class''' consists mostly of white collar professionals most of whom are [[Household income in the United States|well-paid salaried employees]], highly educated salaried professionals whose work is largely self-directed. Many have graduate degrees with educational attainment serving as the main distinguishing feature of this class. Household incomes commonly may exceed $100,000, with some smaller one-income earners household having incomes in the high 5-figure range.<ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = | coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus

As a result upper middle class employees enjoy great autonomy in the work place and are more satisfied with their careers than non-professional middle class individuals. The [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]] among the members of this class lends the professional middle class its immunity against economic downturns, above-average lifestyle and also serves as the main entrance barrier into this class.<ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class">{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class

Values and mannerisms are difficult to pint-point for an intellectual concept encompassing millions of persons. Naturally any large group of people will feature social diversity to some extent or another. Some generalizations, however, can be made using education and income as class defining criteria. William Thompson and Joseph Hickey noted that upper middle class individual possess a more direct and confident manner of speech.<ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = | coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, MA| id = 0-205-41365-X}}</ref> In her 1989 publication ''Effects of Social Class and Interactive Setting on Maternal Speech'', Erica Hoff-Ginsberg found that among her surveyed subjects, "Upper-middle class mothers talked more per unit of time and sustained longer interactions with children." She also found that the speech of upper middle class mothers differ "in its functional, discourse, and lexico-syntactic properties," from those in the working class.<ref name="Education resource information center, Effects of Social Class and Interactive Setting on Maternal Speech">{{cite web|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/Home.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=RecordDetails&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED309843&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&objectId=0900000b800472a5|title=Education resource information center, Effects of Social Class and Interactive Setting on Maternal Speech|accessdate=2007-01-27}}</ref> Upper middle class manners tend to require individuals engaging in conversational discourse with rather distant associates to abstain from sharing excessive personal information.

(Gilbert, 1998) This contrast to professional class households were gender roles were more equalitarian and losely defined. Upper middle class children were largely thought to adhere to internal, rather standards with cusrosity, individuality, self-direction and openess of new idea being emphasized.<ref name="American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality">{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Dennis | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1997 | title = American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality | publisher = Wadsworth | location = | id = 978-0534505202}}</ref>

Sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert, William Thompson and Joseph Hickey estimate the upper middle class to constitute roughly 15% of the population. Using the 15% figure one may conclude that the American upper middle class consist of professionals making more than $62,500 who commonly reside in households with [[six figure income]]s.<ref name="US Census Bureau, income quintile and top 5% household income distribution and demographic characteristics, 2006">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/hhinc/new05_000.htm|title=US Census Bureau, income quintile and top 5% [[Household income in the United States|household income distribution]] and demographic characteristics, 2006|acessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref><ref name="US Census Bureau, distribution of personal income, 2006">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new01_001.htm|title=US Census Bureau, distribution of personal income, 2006|accessdate=2006-12-09}}</ref>

Many upper middle class professions feature salaries above $67,348, which was the [[Household income in the United States|median household income]] for a household with two income earners in 2003.<ref name="List of Professions and their attributes, US Department of Labor">{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/oco1002.htm|title=List of Professions and their attributes, US Department of Labor|accessdate=2006-09-16}}</ref><ref name="Median household income by size of household, US Census Bureau">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/hhes/income/histinc/h12ar.html|title=Median household income by size of household, US Census Bureau|accessdate=2006-09-16}}</ref> For example, the median salary for economists was $72,780, meaning that the majority of economists out earn the majority of two-income households with their single salary alone.<ref name="Income of economists, US Department of Labor">{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos055.htm#earnings|title=Income of economists, US Department of Labor|accessdate=2006-09-16}}</ref> Overall the median household income of a household whose householder had a Bachelor's degree or higher was $77,179.

===Lower middle class===
According to sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert of Cornell University the middle class is divided into only two groups: the upper middle and lower middle class.<ref name="Class, A Guide through the American status system">{{cite book | last = Fussel | first = Paul | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 1983 | title = Class, A Guide through the American status system | publisher = Touchstone | location = New York, NY | id = 0-671-79225-3}}</ref> As mentioned above the upper middle class, according to Gilbert as well as Thompson & Hickey constitutes roughly 15% of the population. The lower middle class is the second most populous according to both models the most populous class constituting roughly one third of the population, the same percentage as the working class. According to James M. Henslin who also divides the middle class into two sub-groups, however, the lower middle class is the most populous constituting 34% of the population.<ref name="Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships">{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Brian | authorlink = | coauthors = Stacey C. Sawyer, Carl M. Wahlstrom | year = 2005 | title = Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, MA | id = 0-205-36674-0}}</ref> In all three class models the lower middle class is said to consist of "semi-professionals" and lower level white collar employees. An adaptation by sociologists Brian K. William, Stacy C. Sawyer and Carl M. Wahlstrom of Dennis Gilbert's class model gave the following description of the lower middle class:<ref name="Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships">{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Brian | authorlink = | coauthors = Stacey C.

{{cquote|
The lower middle class... these are people in technical and lower-level management positions who work for those in the upper middle class as lower managers, craftspeople, and the like. They enjoy a reasonably comfortable standard of living, although it is constantly threatened by taxes and inflation. Generally, they have a high school educational and perhaps some college or apprenticeship education." - Brian K. William, Stacy C. Sawyer and Carl M.

}}

Taking into account the percentages provided in the six class model by Gilbert as well as Thompson and Hickey one can apply US Census Bureau statistics regarding [[Income in the United States|income]]. According to these class models the lower middle class is located roughly between the 52<sup>nd</sup> and 84<sup>th</sup> percentile of society. In terms of personal income distribution in 2005 that would meant [[Personal income in the United States|gross annual personal incomes]] from about $32,500 to $60,000.<ref name="US Census Bureau, distribution of personal income, 2006">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new01_001.htm|title=US Census Bureau, distribution of personal income, 2006|accessdate=2006-12-09}}</ref> As 42% of all households, and majority of those in the top 40%, had two [[income earner]]s [[Household income in the United States|household income figures]] would be significantly higher ranging from roughly $50,000 to $100,000 annually.<ref name="US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new06_000.htm|title=US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref> In terms of [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]], 27% of persons had a [[Bachelor's degree or higher]]. If the upper middle and upper class combined are to constitute 16% of the population it becomes clear that some of those in the lower middle class boast college degrees and some college education.<ref name="US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2003">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/p20-550.pdf|title=US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2003|accessdate=2006-07-31}}</ref>

===Working class majority===
According to some, the majority of Americans may also be correctly be referred to as being members of the working class.<ref name="The American Perception of Class">{{cite book | last = Vanneman | first = Reeve | authorlink =  | coauthors = Lynn Weber Cannon | year = 1988 | title = The American Perception of Class

This use of term "Working class" is largely applicable if the nature of work becomes the main determinant of social class. After all, social class is the distribution of individuals among positions within society whose influence and importance differs. Thus the nature of a person's work and the associated degrees of influence, responsibility, and complexity determine, to a large degree, a person's social class. The more influence and responsibility a person has and the more complex his or her work, the higher his or her status in society.<ref name="Social Class and Stratification">{{cite book | last = Levine | first = Rhonda | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1998 | title = Social Class and Stratification

Many of these working class workers are most commonly, due to their income, called middle-middle or statistical middle class. Class models such as the ones brought forth by Dennis Gilbert or Thompson and Hickey estimate that roughly 53% of Americans are members of the working or lower classes.<ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = | coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, MA| id = 0-205-41365-X}}</ref><ref name="American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality">{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Dennis | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1997 | title = American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality | publisher = Wadsworth | location = | id = 978-0534505202}}</ref>

It is the nature of their work and lack of influence that leads some to come to the conclusion that most Americans are working class. The majority of workers are not paid to share their thoughts and ideas as much as professionals. They are commonly closely supervised and do not enjoy a great deal of independence in their jobs. They are also not commonly paid to think and their thoughts are not often sought by their employer organizations or clients, which leads to a lack of influence. A dentist's office offers itself as an example.<ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class">{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class
 | publisher = Harper Collins | location = New York, NY | id = 0-06-0973331}}</ref> In May 2004, dentists had a median income of $129,920, indicating a high degree of scarcity for qualified personnel. The opinion and thoughts of dentists, much like those of other professionals, are sought after by their organization and clients. The [[dentist]] creates a diagnosis, consults the patient, and conceptualizes a treatment.<ref name="Income and nature of work of dentists">{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos097.htm#earnings|title=Income and nature of work of dentists|accessdate=2006-09-13}}</ref> [[Dental hygienist]]s made roughly $28 an hour, about $56,000 annually or $36,000 as many do not work forty hours a week.

As a result [[dental hygienist]]s may be referred to as being working class, even though two successful dental hygienists could out earn one dentist. Similar relationships can be observed in other occupations, such as between [[professor]]s, [[journalist]]s, and [[economist]]s on the one hand, and their researchers on the other.

===Vernacular middle class===
The term middle class in more colloquial language use may refer all those individuals who might at one point or another be identified as middle class, as they are neither extreme of the socio-economic strata. The term can also be used to describe those at the actual center of the income strata, who may also be referred to as the middle-middle class. There many different theories on the middle-middle class. The middle-middle class may be composed of those households with an annual income of 80% to 120% of the national median household income. Persons in this income range could be, in accordance to solely economic reasoning be referred to as the American average. Such households would boast annual incomes ranging from $35,200 to $52,800, and thus be located in the middle of the income range.<ref name="US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new06_000.htm|title=US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref> Such households, while actually being in the middle and thus sometimes referred to as being middle class, cannot, however, afford the middle class lifestyle.<ref name="Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/10.30/19-bankruptcy.html|title=Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle|accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref> Yet another definition states that the statistical middle class includes all those households with income ranging from $25,000 to $100,000.<ref name="Middle class according to The Drum Major Institute for public policy">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/now/politics/middleclassoverview.html|title=Middle class according to The Drum Major Institute for public policy|accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref> This is however a very vague definition as it includes persons from all but the lowest quintile. Using this definition creates a class so economically fragmented that it would lump together those who are struggling to make ends meet with two incomes and those who are able to live the iconic middle class lifestyle with just one income and are [[Educational attainment in the United States|highly educated]].

===Weberian definition===
Some modern theories of [[political economy]] consider a large middle class to be a beneficial, stabilizing influence on [[society]], because it has neither the possibly explosive [[revolution]]ary tendencies of the [[lower class]], nor the [[Political absolutism|absolutist]] tendencies of an entrenched [[upper class]].  Most [[Sociology|sociological]] definitions of middle class follow [[Max Weber]].  Here the middle class is defined by a constituting of [[professional]]s or [[business]] owners; by a shared [[culture]] of domesticity and sub-urbanity; and by a level of relative security against social crisis in the form of socially desired skill or wealth. Thus the theory on the middle class by Max Weber can be cited as one that supports the notion of the middle class being composed of a quasi-elite of professionals and managers, who are largely immune to economic down turns and trends such as out-sourcing which affect the statistical middle class.<ref name="Washington Post on the Middle class squeeze">{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A34235-2004Sep19?language=printer|title=Washington Post on the Middle class squeeze|accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref>

While there is no one coherent definition of middle class and the incomes of those to whom the term is applied will likely vary depending on how one defines middle class, certain income trends may be helpful. Depending on whether the middle class is defined as consisting of professionals or of those in the middle of the income strata the following income trend may or may not be helpful in determining what middle class is. In 2004, the middle fifty percent of households had [[Household income in the United States|annual gross incomes]] between $22,500 and $75,000. [[Household income in the United States#Income distribution|The top quarter]] (26.8%) of households earned more than $75,000 while the [[Household income in the United States#Income distribution|bottom quarter]] earned (25.24%) earned less than $22,500 annually.<ref name="US Census Bureau, overall income distribution among households">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new06_000.htm|title=US Census Bureau, overall income distribution among households|accessdate=2006-10-03}}</ref> Overall the median personal income of a male, age 25 or older was $33,517, while that for a female was $19,679.

===Education and income===
[[Educational attainment in the United States|Educational attainment]] is one of the most prominent determinants of class status. As [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]] represents expertise, which is a necessary component of the capitalistic market system, its ownership may be seen as the ownership of one of the factors of production.<ref name="Occupation and Class Consciousness in America">{{cite book | last = Eichar | first = Douglas | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1989 | title = Occupation and Class Consciousness in America | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | id = 0-313-26111-3}}</ref> In other words, those with [[Educational attainment in the United States|advanced degrees]] already own one of the essential buttresses of the economy: expertise. Additionally [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]] is basis for occupational selection. Those with higher educational attainment tend to be positioned in occupations with greater autonomy, influence over the organizational process, and better [[Household income in the United States|financial compensation]]. While [[Household income in the United States|economic compensation]] is merely the result of scarcity, educational attainment may be related to that very economic principle as well. The attainment of a [[Educational attainment in the United States|graduate degree]] represents the acquisition of expertise, a factor of production, that in itself may be scarce; thus leading to better financial compensation for the owner.<ref name="Occupation and Class Consciousness in America">{{cite book | last = Eichar | first = Douglas | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1989 | title = Occupation and Class Consciousness in America | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | id = 0-313-26111-3}}</ref> As stated above the upper middle class features a strong reliance on [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]] (the ownership of expertise) for much of its social and economic well-being.<ref name="Household income according to the educational attainment of householder">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/h13.html|title=Household income according to the educational attainment of householder|accessdate=2006-09-16}}</ref><ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class">{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class

===Double income controversy===
[[Image:Distribution of Two income plus households.jpg|thumb|250px|Percentage distribution of 2+ income households among the quintiles]]
[[Household income in the United States|Income]] is one of the most commonly used attributes of a household to determine its class status. The relationship between [[Household income in the United States|income]], which mostly arises from the scarcity of a certain skill, and class status may, however, prove to be more complex than initially perceived.<ref name="Social Class and Stratification">{{cite book | last = Levine | first = Rhonda | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1998 | title = Social Class and Stratification | publisher = Rowman & Littlefield | location = Lanham, MD | id = 0-8476-8543-8}}</ref> While the idea is that income reflects status by reflecting educational attainment and occupation, household income may just be the product of two or more [[Household income in the United States|incomes]] combined. In 2005, 42% of all American households had two [[Household income in the United States|income earners]]. The vast majority of households in the top quintile had two or more income earners. This means that most households with an [[Household income in the United States|annual gross income]] of over $88,000 annually would not boast such incomes if it were not for them having two income earners. As a result the perceived [[Wealth in the United States|affluence]] of many households is merely the result of the combination of two incomes.<ref name="US Census Bureau, Income earners by quintile">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new05_000.htm|title=US Census Bureau, Income earners by quintile|accessdate=2006-10-25}}</ref>Therefore, the question of whether or not the combination of incomes results in higher social status arises. Of course, there is no definite answer as class is a vague sociological concept.<ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = | coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, MA| id = 0-205-41365-X}}</ref> 

Scoiologist Dennis Gilbert acknowledges that a working class household with two income earners may out-earn a single-income upper middle class household as the number of income earners has eveovled into one of the most important variables in determining household income. He contends that households from a given class may out-earn households of higher standing due to a difference in the number of income earners. For example, according to the US Department of Labor, two registered nurses could quite easily command a household income of $126,000 annually,<ref name="US Department of Labor, Median income of registered nurses">{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos083.htm#earnings|title=US Department of Labor, registered nurses|accessdate=2006-10-25}}</ref> while the median income for a lawyer was $94,930.<ref name="US Department of Labor, Median income of lawyers">{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos053.htm#earnings|title=US Department of Labor, Median income of lawyers|accessdate=2006-10-25}}</ref> As perceptions of class in the US remain ambigous, the question of whether or not the two nurses actually achieve the same status level as the lawyer remains unanswered as well. The combination of two or more incomes, allow for households to increase their income substantially without moving higher on the occupational latter or attaining higher [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational degrees]]. Thus it is important to remember that the seemingly favorable economic position of households in the top two quintiles is in most cases merely the result of two or more combined incomes,<ref name="US Census Bureau, Income earners by quintile">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new05_000.htm|title=US Census Bureau, Income earners by quintile|accessdate=2006-10-25}}</ref> leading sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert to conclude that household income "will vary considerably in practice."

==Influence==
[[Image:Greenspan.jpg|thumb|right|Alan Greenspan, former Federal Reserve Chairman|thumb|200px]]Even though [[Alan Greenspan]] was a member of America's [[Income quintiles|top 5%]], [[economist]]s are mostly members of the professional middle class. Economists like many other members of the professional middle class enjoy a large amount of autonomy in their work with their counsel and ideas guiding the economic policy and strategy of both, private companies as well as that of government agencies such as the [[Federal Reserve]].
The influence of the middle class depends on which theory one utilizes. If the middle class is defined as a modern [[bourgeoisie]], the "middle class" has great influence. If middle class is used in a manner that it includes all persons who are at neither extreme of the [[Social structure|social strata]], it might still be influential as such definition may include the "professional middle class" which is then commonly referred to as the "upper middle class." Despite the fact that the professional (upper) middle class is a privileged minority, the professional middle class is the perhaps the most influential class in the United States.<ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class">{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class | publisher = Harper Collins | location = New York, NY | id = 0-06-0973331}}</ref>

{{cquote|
"Most ideas that find their way into the cultural mainstream... are crafted by a relative elite: people who are well educated, reasonably well-paid, and who overlap, socially and through family ties, with at least the middling levels of the business community&mdash;in short, the professional middle class." -''[[Barbara Ehrenreich]]''
}}
Several reasons can be cited as to why the [[professional class|professional middle class]] is so influential. One is that [[journalists]], commentators, [[writer]]s, [[professor]]s, [[economist]]s and [[Political Scientist|political scientists]], who are essential in shaping public opinion, are almost exclusively members of the professional middle class. Considering the overwhelming presence of professional middle class persons in [[post secondary education]], another essential instrument in regards to shaping [[public opinion]], it should come as no surprise that the lifestyle exclusive to this quasi-elite has become indicative of the [[United States|American]] mainstream itself. In addition to setting trends, the professional middle class also holds occupations which include managerial duties, meaning that middle class professionals spend much of their work-life directing others and conceptualizing the workday for the average worker.<ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class">{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class
 | publisher = Harper Collins | location = New York, NY | id = 0-06-0973331}}</ref> Yet another reason is the economic cloud generated by this class. In 2005, according to [[US Census]] statistics, the [[Income quintiles|top third]] of society, excluding the [[Income quintiles|top 5%]] controlled the largest share of [[Household income in the United States#Aggregate income distribution|income]] in the [[United States]].<ref name="US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new06_000.htm|title=US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref>  Although some in the statistical middle class, (for example, police officers and fire fighters in the more affluent suburbs in the San Francisco Bay Area) may have lifestyle as comfortable as those found among the ranks of the professional middle class, only few have the same degree of autonomy and influence over society as those in the professional middle class.<ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class">{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class

==Defining attributes==
[[Image:Campus Spring.jpg|thumb|250px|Educational attainment is one of the most important features of the middle class, as it sets the precedent for occupation and the resulting financial compensation. Furthermore, the attainment of academic degrees may be seen as ownership of productive assets.<ref name="Occupation and Class Consciousness in America">{{cite book | last = Eichar | first = Douglas | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1989 | title = Occupation and Class Consciousness in America | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | id = 0-313-26111-3}}</ref>]] 
Identifying those attributes that are indicative of the middle class is again a difficult endeavor, as one is either forced to define the middle class by the means of lifestyle or using the [[Household income in the United States|statistical middle]]. As the term "middle class" is commonly associated with the professional middle class instead of the statistical middle, one is well advised to look at this particular group. In the [[United States]], class overall is largely defined through [[Household income in the United States|income]], occupation, and [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]]. Households in the Professional and Managerial middle class have a relatively wide range of income, ranging from modest incomes for some educators to very high incomes for [[physicians]] and [[lawyers]], who may also very well be members of the [[Income quintiles|top 5%]]. A common attribute is that members of this class have a large amount of autonomy in their work, which tends to be largely self-directed and often includes managerial duties.<ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class">{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class
 | publisher = Harper Collins | location = New York, NY | id = 0-06-0973331}}</ref> While some more affluent members of this class such as physicians, attorneys and psycho-therapists may be [[self-employed]], most members of this class are salaried employees of large organizations. Due to their nature of work however, the opinions, thoughts and ideas of this class' members are influential and are essential to directing the way in which their organization, be it a small consulting firm or the federal government, functions. Yet another difference between the professional middle class and the white collar worker in the statistical middle class is the education of professional middle class persons who most likely possess graduate degrees. [[Educational attainment in the United States|Education]] among members of this class is likely to continue life-long as many [[professional class|professionals]] and [[managerial class|managers]] publish essays in their professional journals and attend seminars and workshops. The life-long learning is necessary for [[professionals]] and [[managers]] as their work often includes directing others and visualizing new ideas and concepts.<ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class">{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class
 | publisher = Harper Collins | location = New York, NY | id = 0-06-0973331}}</ref>

As for the statistical middle class, the defining attributes vary with each person's perception of middle class. While the statistical middle class, if defined loosely enough, would include the professional middle class, large parts of it could not afford the lifestyle indicative of the middle class.<ref name="Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/10.30/19-bankruptcy.html|title=Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle|accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref> [[Homeownership in the United States|Homeownership]], the sufficient economic means to afford necessities such as health care including regular dental visits, and some luxuries such as one [[Passenger vehicles in the United States|motor vehicle]] per licensed driver. While more severe problems such as overcrowding are rare among the statistical middle (80% to 120% of the median), its relatively low educational attainment causes it to be very prone to fluctuations in the economy. Overall job security tends to be relatively low, with the average American changing jobs roughly every two years. Most households in the statistical middle rely on two incomes in order to make ends meet and cannot bear to lose even one income for an extended period of time.<ref name="Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/10.30/19-bankruptcy.html|title=Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle|accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref>

===Typical occupations===
[[Image:Salinas Office.jpg|thumb|250px|Office buildings such as this are often the place of work for the vast majority of middle class Americans, whether they are upper middle class professional or working class secretaries.]]
''Note that according to the many different ways of sub-dividing the middle class, some of the occupations indicative of the professional middle class might be categorized as [[upper middle class|upper-middle]], true middle, or middle-middle. It is important to remember that there is no accurate economic or sociological definition of what is middle class.<ref name="Middle class according to The Drum Major Institute for public policy">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/now/politics/middleclassoverview.html|title=Middle class according to The Drum Major Institute for public policy|accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref>''

As mentioned above typical occupations for members of the middle class are those identified as being part of "The professions" and often include managerial duties as well with all being [[white collar]]. There is great diversity among the occupations found among those living the middle class lifestyle and the appropriateness of some occupations being placed on this will depend on each individual’s different outlook. The following is a list of occupations one might expect to find among this class:<ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class">{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class

Autonomy is often seen as one of the greatest measurement of person's class status. Even though some working class employees might also enjoy largely self-directed work, large degrees of autonomy in the work place as well as influence over the organizational process, which are commonly the results of obtained expertise, can still be seen as hallmarks of upper middle class or professional middle class professions.<ref name="Occupation and Class Consciousness in America">{{cite book | last = Eichar | first = Douglas | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1989 | title = Occupation and Class Consciousness in America | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | id = 0-313-26111-3}}</ref>

As for the statistical middle class other less prestigious occupations such as [[realtor|real estate agents]], many less-paid sales positions, entry-level management, higher paying [[blue collar]], etc... would be part of the statistical middle class.<ref name="New York Times, guidelines for determining class in America">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/class/|title=New York Times, guidelines for determining class in America|accessdate=2006-07-28}}</ref> In addition to professionals whose work is largely self-directed and includes managerial duties, many other less privileged members of the statistical middle class would find themselves in [[white collar]] positions without much influence and with somewhat strict supervision. Many of those in statistical middle class might work in what are called the professional support fields. These fields include occupations such as researchers, dental hygienists, and other clerical work. While the majority of the statistical middle class would have at least some form of [[academic degree|college-degree]], especially when counting the members of the professional middle class, many would have no degree. As stated above a large proportion of jobs in the statistical middle class, outside of the [[Professional class|professions]] and [[Managerial class|management]] would feature relatively low job security. Families often to rely on two [[Household income in the United States|incomes]] to make ends meet.<ref name="Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/10.30/19-bankruptcy.html|title=Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle|accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref>

===Consumption===
[[Image:DSC06601.JPG|thumb|250px|An upscale home in [[Salinas, CA]].]]
The American middle class, at least those living the lifestyle, has become known around the world for [[conspicuous consumption]]. To this day, the professional middle class in the [[United States]] holds the world record for having the largest homes, most appliances and [[Passenger vehicles in the United States|automobiles]]. In 2005 the average [[McMansion|new home]] had a square footage of 2,434 square feet (roughly 243 square meters) with 58% of these homes having ceilings with a height in excess of nine feet on the first floor. As new homes only represent a small portion of the housing stock in the US, with most [[suburb|suburban]] homes having been built in the 1970s when the [[Real estate pricing|average square footage]] was only a mere 1,600,<ref name="Realty Times, the increasing size of American homes">{{cite web|url=http://realtytimes.com/rtapages/20060619_downsizinghomes.htm|title=Realty Times, the increasing size of American homes|accessdate=2006-07-26}}</ref> it is fair to assume that these large new suburban homes will be inhabited by members of the professional middle class. Overall many social critics and [[intellectuals]], most of whom are members of the professional middle class themselves, have commented on the extravagant consumption habits of the professional middle class. It is also often pointed out that the suburban lifestyle of American professional middle class is a major reason for its record consumption. Many members of this class have feared that this consumption will lead to a gradual erosion of moral and ethical values. The increasing materialism, even among such a [[Educational attainment in the United States|highly-educated]] class, is also often claimed to be connected to the notion of rugged individualism which gained popularity among the ranks of the professional middle class in the 1970s and 80s.<ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class">{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 1989 |title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class
 | publisher = Harper Collins | location = New York, NY | id = 0-06-0973331}}</ref><ref name="Professional Occupations according to the US Department of Labor">{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/oco1002.htm|title=Professional Occupations according to the US Department of Labor|accessdate=2006-07-26}}</ref>

===Education===
The relevance of [[Educational attainment in the United States|education]] in regards to defining the middle class depends largely on whether one is looking at the statistical middle or just the professional middle class. As the statistical middle class is an extremely vague concept lumping together [[Professional class|professionals]] such as [[professor]]s and political scientists who hold [[Doctorate|doctorate degrees]] with clerical workers who may or may not hold a [[academic degree|four-year college degree]], the importance and prevalence of higher education varies. Overall persons with four-year college degrees made up a sizable minority of the statistical middle class while the majority had attended college.<ref name="US Census Bureau, Educational attainment in the United States, 2000 Census">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP20&-ds_name=D&-_lang=en|title=US Census Bureau, Educational attainment in the United States, 2000 Census|accessdate=2006-07-30}}</ref> Only a small minority had graduate degrees. This contradicts greatly to the role education plays among the professional middle class. Here education is one of the dearest core values with institutions of higher education being a rite of passage for professional middle class youth. Earning a college degree also represents the main entrance hurdle faced by those wishing to rise up into the professional middle class.<ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class">{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 1989 |title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class
 | publisher = Harper Collins | location = New York, NY |id = 0-06-0973331}}</ref> As one might imagine a large percentage of professionals and managers have graduate degrees, spending six to eight years in post-secondary education.

==Middle class squeeze==
In the [[1990s]] and [[2000s]], many feared that the spreading wealth gap would lead to a "collapse of the middle" in American society. A modern threat to the statistical middle class is [[downsizing]] in many sectors of the American economy, competition from lower-paid foreign workers and contractors, and the systematic elimination of unionized labor. The scenario most commonly reordered currently by the country's top news publications is that the statistical middle is splitting into two, a well-off, high-income middle class -the professional middle class- and a lower-income middle class. The high-income middle class is commonly defined as those out-earning those at the center of society. A change in the income distribution of American cities may serve as an example of the statistical middle class splitting into the well-paid professional and managerial middle class and the statistical middle of society.<ref name="Washington Post, America is losing its middle income neighborhoods">{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/21/AR2006062101735.html|title=Washington Post, America is losing its middle income neighborhoods|accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref>
In recent years many American cities with home prices near the national median have seen their middle income neighborhoods, those in which the median income is between 80% and 120% of the metropolitan median income, dissolve with the more affluent members of the professional middle class leaving for newer developments in more exclusive suburbs.<ref name="Washington Post, America is losing its middle income neighborhoods">{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/21/AR2006062101735.html|title=Washington Post, America is losing its middle income neighborhoods|accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref>
In more expensive areas such as in [[California]] and [[Hawaii]], many former middle income neighborhoods have now become upper-middle professional middle class neighborhoods with the statistical middle class and those below the median being displaced. Thus many American cities have become more segregated between the professional and managerial middle class living the iconic middle class lifestyle and the statistical middle of American society which has either been displaced or left behind in the former statistical middle income neighborhoods.<ref name="Washington Post, America is losing its middle income neighborhoods">{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/21/AR2006062101735.html|title=Washington Post, America is losing its middle income neighborhoods|accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref> This middle class squeeze has made the divide between the statistical middle, those who are neither rich nor poor, and the professional middle class starker as the median income has overall decreased despite an increase among the top two quintiles.<ref name="Washington Post, Income gap widens">{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A34235-2004Sep19?language=printer|title=Washington Post, Income gap widenes|accessdate=2006-07-26}}</ref>

As a many, even a majority according to some polls, identify themselves as middle class, the need for subdivisions has arisen. While to conceptualize dividing the middle class into three subsections, the upper middle, middle-middle and lower middle remains popular, sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert of Cornell University contend with dividing the middle class into two groups. In such class models the middle class is divided into an upper middle and lower middle class, while those otherwise labeled as lower middle class are identified as working class. At the upper end of the middle class one finds white collar professionals with graduate degrees who are commonly among the top 15% of income earners ($62,500 or more in 2005). As a result of marriage these individuals commonly reside in households with six figure incomes. The middle class also includes semi-professionals with Bachelor’s degrees as well as other white collar workers who may have some college education at the lower end.<ref name="American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality">{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Dennis | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1997 | title = American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality | publisher = Wadsworth | location = | id = 978-0534505202}}</ref>

===Gilbert & Kahl===
In ''The American Class Structure, 6th edition'' (Wadsworth 2002) as well the preceding 5th edition, Dennis Gilbert lays out an even more precise breakdown of American social classes. Dennis Gilbert stresses that "there is really no way to establish that a particular model is 'true' and another 'false.'" He states that his model emphasizes sources of income and that household income, being very dependent on the number of income earners, varies greatly within each social class. The class descriptions in quotes below are lifted from the 5th edition, pages 284 and 285.<ref name="The American Class Structure">{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Dennis | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1998 | title = The American Class Structure | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing | location = New York | id = 0-534-50520-1}}</ref>

The [[Household income in the United States#Mean income|average household income]] is $12,000 a year, and the class makes up 12% of the population.

===Thompson & Hickey===
In their 2005 sociology textbook, ''Society in Focus'', sociologists William Thompson and Joseph Hickey present a five class model in which the middle class is divided into two sections and the term working class is applied to clerical and pink collar workers. Their class system goes as follows:<ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = | coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, MA| id = 0-205-41365-X}}</ref> Sociologist Dennis Gilbert at Cornell University has proposed a similar class system with nearly identical class characteristics.<ref name="American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality">{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Dennis | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1997 | title = American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality | publisher = Wadsworth | location = | id = 978-0534505202}}</ref>
*'''Upper class''', (ca. 1%-5%) individuals with considerable power over the nation's economic and political institutions. This group owns sizable share of the nation's resources. The top 1% had [[Income in the United States|incomes]] exceeding $250,000 with the top 5% having [[Household income in the United States|household incomes]] exceeding $140,000. This group features strong group solidarity and is largely constituted by the heirs to multi-generational fortunes. Prominent government officials, corporate chief executive officers, and successful entrepreneurs are among the upper class even if not of elite background.<ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = | coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, MA| id = 0-205-41365-X}}</ref>
*'''Upper middle class''', (ca. 15%) white collar professionals with [[Educational attainment in the United States|advanced post-secondary education]] such as physicians, professors, lawyers, corporate executives, and other management. While households commonly have [[six figure income]]s in this group, some one [[Household income in the United States|income earner households]] and lesser paid professionals may not. While, high [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]] commonly serves as staple mark of this group, entrepreneurs and business owners may also be upper middle class even if lacking advanced educational attainment.<ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = | coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, MA| id = 0-205-41365-X}}</ref><ref name="American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality">{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Dennis | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1997 | title = American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality | publisher = Wadsworth | location = | id = 978-0534505202}}</ref>
*'''Lower middle class''', (ca. 33%) individuals who worked their way through college and commonly have a Bachelor's degree or some [[Educational attainment in the United States|college education]]. School teachers, sales-employees and lower to mid level supervisors rank among those in this particular group. [[Household income in the United States|Household income]] is general in the range of $30,000 to $75,000. Workers in this group are mostly white collar but have less autonomy in their work than do upper middle class professionals. Members of this class often attempt to emulate those in the two higher classes and have recently become overly indebted by their desire to have a comfortable lifestyle.<ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = | coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, MA| id = 0-205-41365-X}}</ref>
*'''Working class''', (ca. 30%) individuals who occupy both blue and white collar occupations. Pink collar workers in predominantly female clerical positions are common in this class. Job security tends to be low for this group and unemployment as well as losing health insurance remains potent economic threats. [[Household income in the United States|Household incomes]] typically range from $16,000 to $30,000.<ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = | coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, MA| id = 0-205-41365-X}}</ref>
*'''Lower class''', repeated cycles of unemployment, working multiple low-level part-time jobs are common among this group. Many families fall below the [[Poverty in the United States|poverty line]] from time to time when employment opportunities are scarce.<ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = | coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, MA| id = 0-205-41365-X}}</ref>
