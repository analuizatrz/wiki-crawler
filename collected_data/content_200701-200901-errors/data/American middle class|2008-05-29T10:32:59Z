There is considerable diversity among members of the middle class, who tend to overlap with each other. Overall, middle class persons, especially upper middle class individuals, are characterized by conceptualizing, creating and consulting. Thus, [[Educational attainment in the United States|college education]] is one of the main indicators of middle class status. Largely attributed to the nature of middle class occupations, middle class values tend to emphasize independence, adherence to intrinsic standards, valuing innovation and respecting [[non-conformity]].<ref name="The American Class Structure">{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Dennis |   year = 1998 | title = The American Class Structure | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing | location = New York | id = 0-534-50520-1}}</ref><ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William |  coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, MA| id = 0-205-41365-X}}</ref> [[Political ideologies in the United States|Politically]] more active than other demographics, college educated middle class professionals are split.<ref name="Judis, B.

==Sub-divisions==
[[Image:Class distribution US.svg|thumb|right|300px|America's middle class according to the systems of sociologists Playa' Perrotto; James McKenzie; and Ben Meter and Andrew Gikas. In all three class systems, the high class in the 1967 is divided into two parts, together constituting 47% to 49% of the total population.]]
Most sociologists, such as Ryan Silverman of East Hills, Paul Jeckel, and Joseph Hickey, divide the middle class into two groups. The middle class thereby consists of an upper middle class, made up of professionals distinguished by exceptionally high educational attainment as well as high economic security; and a lower middle class, consisting of semi-professionals. While the groups overlap, differences between those at the center of both groups are considerable. The lower middle class has lower educational attainment, considerably less workplace autonomy and lower incomes than the upper middle class. With the emergence of a two-tier labor market, the economic benefits and life chances of upper middle class professionals have grown considerably compared to those of the lower middle class.<ref name="The American Class Structure">{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Dennis |   year = 1998 | title = The American Class Structure | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing | location = New York | id = 0-534-50520-1}}</ref><ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William |  coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus| publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, MA | id = 0-205-41365-X}}</ref> The lower middle class also commonly needs two income earners in order to sustain a comfortable standard of living, while many upper middle class households can maintain a similar standard of living with just one income earner.<ref name="Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/10.30/19-bankruptcy.html|title=Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle|author=Beth Potier |date=October 30, 2003|publisher=Harvard Gazette|accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref><ref name="Washington Post on the Middle class squeeze">{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A34235-2004Sep19?language=printer|title=As Income Gap Widens, Uncertainty Spreads|author=Griff Witte|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 20, 2004|accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref> Both groups, depending on definition, are believed to be growing.

===The professional/managerial middle class===
The '''professional class''', also called the '''upper middle class''', consists mostly of white collar professionals, most of whom are highly educated, salaried professionals whose work is largely self-directed. Many have graduate degrees, with educational attainment serving as the main distinguishing feature of this class. Household incomes commonly exceed $100,000, with some smaller one-income-earner households having incomes in the high 5-figure range.<ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William |  coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus

As a result, upper middle class employees enjoy great autonomy in the work place and are more satisfied with their careers than non-professional middle class individuals. The [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]] among the members of this class lends the professional middle class some immunity against economic downturns and an above-average lifestyle while also serving as the main entrance barrier into this class.<ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class">{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara |   year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class

Values and mannerisms are difficult to pinpoint for a group encompassing millions of persons. Naturally, any large group of people will feature social diversity to some extent.  However, some generalizations can be made using education and income as class defining criteria. William Thompson and Joseph Hickey noted that upper middle class individual have a more direct and confident manner of speech.<ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William |  coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, MA| id = 0-205-41365-X}}</ref> In her 1989 publication ''Effects of Social Class and Interactive Setting on Maternal Speech'', Erica Hoff-Ginsberg found that among her surveyed subjects, "Upper-middle class mothers talked more per unit of time and sustained longer interactions with children." She also found that the speech of upper middle class mothers differs "in its functional, discourse, and lexico-syntactic properties," from those in the working class.<ref name="Education resource information center, Effects of Social Class and Interactive Setting on Maternal Speech">{{cite web|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/Home.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=RecordDetails&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED309843&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&objectId=0900000b800472a5|title=Education resource information center, Effects of Social Class and Interactive Setting on Maternal Speech|accessdate=2007-01-27}}</ref> Upper middle class manners tend to require individuals engaging in conversational discourse with rather distant associates, and to abstain from sharing excessive personal information.

(Gilbert, 1998) This contrasted with professional class households, where gender roles were more egalitarian and loosely defined. Upper middle class children were largely taught to adhere to internal standards, with curiosity, individuality, self-direction and openness to new ideas being emphasized.<ref name="American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality">{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Dennis |   year = 1997 | title = American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality | publisher = Wadsworth |  id = 978-0534505202}}</ref> While a recent gallup survey showed mass affluent households to be conservative on economic issues while liberal on social issues, the upper middle class seems to be relatively politically polarized. In the 2006 mid-term elections both Democrats and Republicans received over 40% of the vote from those with advanced degrees and those in households with six figure incomes. While households with incomes exceeding $100,000 tend to favor Republicans slightly, they are also the only income demographic where [[Ralph Nader]] won more than 1% of the vote. Among those with graduate degrees, a smaller group than those with six figure incomes, the majority tends to vote Democratic<ref name="CNN exit poll, 2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006/pages/results/states/US/H/00/epolls.0.html|title=CNN exit poll, 2006|accessdate=2007-06-14}}</ref> with roughly 1% having voted for Nader in 2004.<ref name="CNN exit poll, 2004">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html|title=CNN exit poll, 2004|accessdate=2007-06-14}}</ref>

Sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert, William Thompson and Joseph Hickey estimate the upper middle class to constitute roughly 15% of the population.

===Lower middle class===<!-- This section is linked from [[Social class]] -->
The lower middle class is the second most populous according to both Gilbert's as well as Thompson & Hickey's models, constituting roughly one third of the population, the same percentage as the working class. However, according to James M. Henslin, who also divides the middle class into two sub-groups, the lower middle class is the most populous, constituting 34% of the population.<ref name="Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships">{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Brian |  coauthors = Stacey C.

An adaptation by sociologists Brian K. William, Stacy C. Sawyer and Carl M.

Taking into account the percentages provided in the six class model by Gilbert, as well as the model of Thompson and Hickey, one can apply US Census Bureau statistics regarding [[Income in the United States|income]]. According to these class models the lower middle class is located roughly between the 52<sup>nd</sup> and 84<sup>th</sup> percentile of society. In terms of personal income distribution in 2005, that would mean [[Personal income in the United States|gross annual personal incomes]] from about $32,500 to $60,000.<ref name="US Census Bureau, distribution of personal income, 2006">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new01_001.htm|title=US Census Bureau, distribution of personal income, 2006|accessdate=2006-12-09}}</ref> As 42% of all households, and the majority of those in the top 40%, had two [[income earner]]s, [[Household income in the United States|household income figures]] would be significantly higher, ranging from roughly $50,000 to $100,000 annually.<ref name="US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new06_000.htm|title=US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref> In terms of [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]], 27% of persons had a [[Bachelor's degree or higher]].

This use of the term "working class" is largely applicable if the nature of work becomes the main determinant of social class. After all, social class is the distribution of individuals among positions within society whose influence and importance differ. Thus the nature of a person's work and the associated degrees of influence, responsibility, and complexity determine, to a large degree, a person's social class. The more influence and responsibility a person has and the more complex his or her work, the higher his or her status in society.<ref name="Social Class and Stratification">{{cite book | last = Levine | first = Rhonda |   year = 1998 | title = Social Class and Stratification

Many of these working class workers are most commonly, due to their income, called middle-middle or statistical middle class.

It is the nature of their work and lack of influence that leads some to come to the conclusion that most Americans are working class. The majority of workers are not paid to share their thoughts and ideas as much as professionals. They are commonly closely supervised and do not enjoy a great deal of independence in their jobs. They are also not commonly paid to think, and their thoughts are not often sought by their employer organizations or clients, which leads to a lack of influence. A dentist's office offers itself as an example.<ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class">{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara |   year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class

As a result [[dental hygienist]]s may be referred to as being working class, even though three successful dental hygienists could out-earn one dentist. Similar relationships can be observed in other occupations, such as between [[professor]]s, [[journalist]]s, and [[economist]]s on the one hand, and their researchers on the other.

===Vernacular middle class===
The term middle class in more colloquial language use may refer to all those individuals who might at one point or another be identified as middle class, as they occupy neither extreme of the socio-economic strata. Most of those with households income between $40,000 and $95,000 identify as "middle class." The term can also be used to describe those at the actual center of the income strata, who may also be referred to as the middle-middle class. There are many different theories on the middle-middle class. The middle-middle class may be composed of those households with annual incomes of 80% to 120% of the national median household income. Persons in this income range could, in accordance to solely economic reasoning, be referred to as the American average. Such households would boast annual incomes ranging from $35,200 to $52,800, and thus be located in the middle of the income range.<ref name="US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new06_000.htm|title=US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref> Some of these households, while actually being in the middle and thus sometimes referred to as being middle class, cannot, however, afford the middle class lifestyle.<ref name="Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/10.30/19-bankruptcy.html|title=Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle|accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref> Yet another definition states that the statistical middle class includes all those households with income ranging from $25,000 to $100,000.<ref name="Middle class according to The Drum Major Institute for public policy">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/now/politics/middleclassoverview.html|title=Middle class according to The Drum Major Institute for public policy|accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref> This is, however, a very vague definition, as it includes persons from all but the lowest quintile. Using this definition creates a class so economically fragmented that it would lump together those who are struggling to make ends meet with two incomes and those who are able to live the iconic middle class lifestyle with just one income and are [[Educational attainment in the United States|highly educated]].

===Weberian definition===
Some modern theories of [[political economy]] consider a large middle class to be a beneficial, stabilizing influence on [[society]], because it has neither the possibly explosive [[revolution]]ary tendencies of the [[lower class]], nor the [[Political absolutism|absolutist]] tendencies of an entrenched [[upper class]].  Most [[Sociology|sociological]] definitions of middle class follow [[Max Weber]].  Here the middle class is defined as consisting of [[professional]]s or [[business]] owners who share a [[culture]] of domesticity and sub-urbanity and a level of relative security against social crisis, in the form of socially desired skill or wealth. Thus the theory on the middle class by Max Weber can be cited as one that supports the notion of the middle class being composed of a quasi-elite of professionals and managers, who are largely immune to economic downturns and trends such as out-sourcing which affect the statistical middle class.<ref name="Washington Post on the Middle class squeeze">{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A34235-2004Sep19?language=printer|title=Washington Post on the Middle class squeeze|accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref>

==Income==
{{main|Personal income in the United States|Household income in the United States}}

As social classes lack clear boundaries and overlap there are no definite income thresholds as for what is considered middle class. Sociologist Leonard Beeghley identifies a male making $57,000 and a female making $40,000 with a combined households income of $97,000 as a typical middle class family.<ref name="The Structure of Social Stratification in the United States">{{cite book | last = Beeghley | first = Leonard |   year = 2004 | title = The Structure of Social Stratification in the United States | publisher = Pearson | location = New York, NY | id = 0-205-37558-8}}</ref> Sociologists William Thompson and Joseph Hickey estimate an income range of roughly $35,000 to $75,000 for the lower middle class and $100,000 or more for the upper middle class. Many social scientists including economist Michael Zweig and sociologist Dennis Gilbert contend that middle class persons usually have above median incomes.

===Education and income===
[[Educational attainment in the United States|Educational attainment]] is one of the most prominent determinants of class status. As [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]] represents expertise, which is a necessary component of the capitalistic market system, its ownership may be seen as the ownership of one of the factors of production.<ref name="Occupation and Class Consciousness in America">{{cite book | last = Eichar | first = Douglas |   year = 1989 | title = Occupation and Class Consciousness in America | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | id = 0-313-26111-3}}</ref> In other words, those with [[Educational attainment in the United States|advanced degrees]] already own one of the essential buttresses of the economy: expertise. Additionally [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]] is basis for occupational selection. Those with higher educational attainment tend to be positioned in occupations with greater autonomy, influence over the organizational process, and better [[Household income in the United States|financial compensation]]. While [[Household income in the United States|economic compensation]] is merely the result of scarcity, educational attainment may be related to that very economic principle as well. The attainment of a [[Educational attainment in the United States|graduate degree]] represents the acquisition of expertise, a factor of production, that in itself may be scarce; thus leading to better financial compensation for the owner.<ref name="Occupation and Class Consciousness in America">{{cite book | last = Eichar | first = Douglas |   year = 1989 | title = Occupation and Class Consciousness in America | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | id = 0-313-26111-3}}</ref> As stated above, the upper middle class features a strong reliance on [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]] (the ownership of expertise) for much of its social and economic well-being.<ref name="Household income according to the educational attainment of householder">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/h13.html|title=Household income according to the educational attainment of householder|accessdate=2006-09-16}}</ref><ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class">{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara |   year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class

===Household income controversy===
[[Image:Distribution of two plus income households.svg|thumb|300px|Percentage distribution of 2+ income households among the quintiles]]
[[Household income in the United States|Income]] is one of a household's attributes most commonly used to determine its class status. Yet, [[Household income in the United States|income]] may not always accurately reflect a household's position within society or the economy.<ref name="Social Class and Stratification">{{cite book | last = Levine | first = Rhonda |   year = 1998 | title = Social Class and Stratification | publisher = Rowman & Littlefield | location = Lanham, MD | id = 0-8476-8543-8}}</ref> Unlike personal income, household income does not reflect occupational achievement as much as it measures the number of income earners. Sociologist Dennis Gilbert acknowledges that a working class household with two income earners may out-earn a single-income upper middle class household, as the number of income earners has evolved into one of the most important variables in determining household income. For example, according to the US Department of Labor, two registered nurses could quite easily command a household income of $126,000 annually,<ref name="US Department of Labor, Median income of registered nurses">{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos083.htm#earnings|title=US Department of Labor, registered nurses|accessdate=2006-10-25}}</ref> while the median income for a lawyer was $94,930.<ref name="US Department of Labor, Median income of lawyers">{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos053.htm#earnings|title=US Department of Labor, Median income of lawyers|accessdate=2006-10-25}}</ref> Furthermore, household income fails to recognize household size. For example, a single attorney, earning $95,000, may have a higher standard of living than a family of four with an income of $120,000. Yet household income is still a commonly used class indicator, as household members share the same economic fate and class position.<ref name="American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality">{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Dennis |   year = 1997 | title = American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality | publisher = Wadsworth |  id = 978-0534505202}}</ref>

{{quote|The parade [of income earners with height representing income] suggest that [the] relationship between the distribution of income and the class structure is… blurred in the middle… we saw dual-income working class marchers looking down on single-income upper-middle class marchers. In sum, the class structures as we have defined it… does not exactly match the distribution of household income.|Dennis Gilbert|''The American Class Structure'', 1998
}}

==Influence==
The influence of the middle class depends on which theory one utilizes. If the middle class is defined as a modern [[bourgeoisie]], the "middle class" has great influence. If middle class is used in a manner that includes all persons who are at neither extreme of the [[Social structure|social strata]], it might still be influential, as such definition may include the "professional middle class," which is then commonly referred to as the "upper middle class." Despite the fact that the professional (upper) middle class is a privileged minority, it is the perhaps the most influential class in the United States.<ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class">{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara |   year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class | publisher = Harper Collins | location = New York, NY | id = 0-06-0973331}}</ref>

{{quote|Most ideas that find their way into the cultural mainstream… are crafted by a relative elite: people who are well educated, reasonably well-paid, and who overlap, socially and through family ties, with at least the middling levels of the business community&mdash;in short, the professional middle class.|[[Barbara Ehrenreich]]}}

Several reasons can be cited as to why the [[professional class|professional middle class]] is so influential. One is that [[journalists]], commentators, [[writer]]s, [[professor]]s, [[economist]]s and [[Political Scientist|political scientists]], who are essential in shaping public opinion, are almost exclusively members of the professional middle class. Considering the overwhelming presence of professional middle class persons in [[post secondary education]], another essential instrument in regards to shaping [[public opinion]], it should come as no surprise that the lifestyle exclusive to this quasi-elite has become indicative of the [[United States|American]] mainstream itself. In addition to setting trends, the professional middle class also holds occupations which include managerial duties, meaning that middle class professionals spend much of their work-life directing others and conceptualizing the workday for the average worker.<ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class">{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara |   year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class
|publisher = Harper Collins | location = New York, NY | id = 0-06-0973331}}</ref> Yet another reason is the economic clout generated by this class. In 2005, according to [[US Census]] statistics, the [[Income quintiles|top third]] of society, excluding the [[Income quintiles|top 5%]], controlled the largest share of [[Household income in the United States#Aggregate income distribution|income]] in the [[United States]].<ref name="US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new06_000.htm|title=US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref>  Although some in the statistical middle class (for example, police officers and fire fighters in the more affluent suburbs in the San Francisco Bay Area) may have lifestyles as comfortable as those found among the ranks of the professional middle class, only few have the same degree of autonomy and influence over society as those in the professional middle class.<ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class">{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara |   year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class

==Typical occupations==
[[Image:Salinas Office.jpg|thumb|250px|Office buildings such as this are often the place of work for the vast majority of middle class Americans, whether they are upper middle class professional or working class secretaries.]]
''Note that according to the many different ways of sub-dividing the middle class, some of the occupations indicative of the professional middle class might be categorized as [[upper middle class|upper-middle]] or lower-middle.

As mentioned above, typical occupations for members of the middle class are those identified as being part of "the professions" and often include managerial duties as well, with all being [[white collar]]. There is great diversity among the occupations found among those living the middle class lifestyle, and the appropriateness of some occupations being placed here will depend on each individual’s personal outlook. The following is a list of occupations one might expect to find among this class:<ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class">{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara |   year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class

''[[Professor]]s (Post-secondary educators), [[Physician]]s, [[Engineer]]s, [[Lawyer]]s, [[Architect]]s, [[Journalist]]s, Mid-level corporate managers, [[Author|Writers]], [[Economist]]s, [[Political Scientist]]s, [[Urban planner]]s, [[Financial manager]]s, [[High school]] [[teacher]]s, Senior [[Nurse]]s and analysts, etc...'' Autonomy is often seen as one of the greatest measurement of a person's class status. Even though some working class employees might also enjoy largely self-directed work, large degrees of autonomy in the work place, as well as influence over the organizational process, which are commonly the results of obtained expertise, these can still be seen as hallmarks of upper middle class or professional middle class professions.<ref name="Occupation and Class Consciousness in America">{{cite book | last = Eichar | first = Douglas |   year = 1989 | title = Occupation and Class Consciousness in America | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | id = 0-313-26111-3}}</ref>

As for the lower middle class, other less prestigious occupations, many less-paid sales positions, entry-level management, higher paying [[blue collar]] positions, etc., would be included.<ref name="New York Times, guidelines for determining class in America">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/class/|title=New York Times, guidelines for determining class in America|accessdate=2006-07-28}}</ref> In addition to professionals whose work is largely self-directed and includes managerial duties, many other less privileged members of the statistical middle class would find themselves in [[white collar]] positions without much influence and with somewhat strict supervision. Many of those in the statistical middle class might work in what are called the professional support fields. These fields include occupations such as dental hygienists, and other clerical work.

==Consumption==
[[Image:DSC06601.JPG|thumb|250px|An upscale home in [[Salinas, CA]].]]
The American middle class, at least those living the lifestyle, has become known around the world for [[conspicuous consumption]]. To this day, the professional middle class in the [[United States]] holds the world record for having the largest homes, most appliances and most [[Passenger vehicles in the United States|automobiles]]. In 2005, the average [[McMansion|new home]] had a square footage of 2,434 square feet (roughly 226 square meters) with 58% of these homes having ceilings with heights in excess of nine feet on the first floor. As new homes only represent a small portion of the housing stock in the US, with most [[suburb]]an homes having been built in the 1970s when the [[Real estate pricing|average square footage]] was 1,600,<ref name="Realty Times, the increasing size of American homes">{{cite web|url=http://realtytimes.com/rtapages/20060619_downsizinghomes.htm|title=Realty Times, the increasing size of American homes|accessdate=2006-07-26}}</ref> it is fair to assume that these large new suburban homes will be inhabited by members of the professional middle class. Overall, many social critics and [[intellectuals]], most of whom are members of the professional middle class themselves, have commented on the extravagant consumption habits of the professional middle class. It is also often pointed out that the suburban lifestyle of the American professional middle class is a major reason for its record consumption. Many members of this class have feared that this consumption will lead to a gradual erosion of moral and ethical values. The increasing materialism, even among such a [[Educational attainment in the United States|highly educated]] class, is also often claimed to be connected to the notion of rugged individualism which gained popularity among the ranks of the professional middle class in the 1970s and 80s.<ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class">{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara |   year = 1989 |title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class

===Shrinking middle class===
The notion that the middle class is shrinking is controversial because the economic boundaries that define the middle class vary.  [[Household]]s that earn between $25,000 and $75,000 represent approximately the middle half of the [[income]] distribution tables provided by the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]].  Over the past two decades, the number of households in those brackets decreased by 3.9%, from 48.2% to 44.3%. During the same time period, the number of households with incomes below $25,000 decreased 3.5%, from 28.7% to 25.2%, while the number of households with incomes above $75,000 increased over 7%, from 23.2% to 30.4%.<ref name="Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2007pubs/p60-233.pdf|title=Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2006|accessdate=2007-11-24}}</ref>

The change has not always been in the same direction.  [[Poverty]] rates increased early in the 1980s until late in the 1990s when they started to go back down.  Since 2000, the percent of all people living in poverty is up from 11.3% to 12.3% in 2006.<ref name="Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2007pubs/p60-233.pdf|title=Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2006|accessdate=2007-11-24}}</ref>

A possible explanation for the increase in the higher earnings categories is that more households now have two wage earners.<ref name="Is America Becoming More of a Class Society?">{{cite news |first=Aaron |last=Bernstein |title=Is America Becoming More of a Class Society? |publisher=BusinessWeek |date=1996-02-26 |}} </ref>  However, a closer analysis reveals all of the 7% increase can be found in households who earn over $100,000.<ref name="Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2007pubs/p60-233.pdf|title=Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2006|accessdate=2007-11-24}}</ref>

A study by [[Brookings Institution]] in June 2006 revealed that middle-income neighborhoods have dropped 17% from 1970 to 2000.{{huh}}  As housing costs increase, the middle class is squeezed and forced to live in less desirable areas making upward mobility more difficult.
