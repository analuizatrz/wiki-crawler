The '''39th Canadian Parliament''' is the current [[Parliament of Canada]], and has been in session since [[April 3]], [[2006]].  The membership was set by the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]] on [[January 23]], [[2006]], and it has changed only somewhat due to resignations and [[by-elections]].  The longest it could run, barring war or national emergency, is five years (to [[February 13]], [[2011]]).  Historically, however, [[minority government]]s in Canada such as the current one have rarely lasted more than two years.

It is controlled by a [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] minority, led by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] and the [[28th Canadian Ministry]], which assumed power on [[February 6]], [[2006]].  The [[Official Opposition (Canada)|Official Opposition]] is the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]], led first by interim leader [[Bill Graham]], and currently by [[Stéphane Dion]].

The [[Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons|Speaker]] is Liberal [[Peter Milliken]].  Milliken was re-elected as the Speaker of the House for the 39th Parliament on [[April 3]], [[2006]]. The Speaker only votes in a tie, and, as Milliken is a Liberal, the Liberal caucus is effectively reduced by one.  This, along with the defection of [[Wajid Khan]] to the Conservatives enables the Conservatives to pass legislation with the cooperation of any one of the three [[opposition parties]]: [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]], [[Bloc Québécois|Bloc]], or [[New Democratic Party]] (NDP).

There has been only one [[Parliamentary session|session]] of the 39th Parliament:

The party standings as elected and as of [[March 21]], [[2007]] are on the table below.  Since the election, three members of the House of Commons [[crossed the floor]] (one of whom had previously been forced to sit as an independent), one died, three resigned, and two members have been elected in by-elections to fill vacancies (two vacancies remain to be filled).  In that same period, two senators have died, six have resigned (four of whom had reached the mandatory retirement age), and one has been appointed to fill a vacancy (twelve vacancies remain).

==Major events==
===Floor-crossing===
Three members of parliament have [[crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] since the election: 

On [[February 6]], [[2006]] [[David Emerson]], elected as the Liberal [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Vancouver Kingsway]], crossed the floor to join Stephen Harper's cabinet as Minister of International Trade.

On [[January 5]], [[2007]] [[Wajid Khan]], elected as the Liberal [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Mississauga—Streetsville]], crossed the floor to join the Harper government.

On [[February 6]], [[2007]] [[Garth Turner]], elected as a Conservative MP for [[Halton (electoral district)|Halton]], moved to the Liberal caucus.  He had been sitting as an Independent since being suspended from the Tory caucus on [[October 18]], [[2006]].

===Liberal leadership===
During the election campaign, the Liberal leader was then Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]].   After the election results were announced, Liberal leader [[Paul Martin]] announced his intention to resign, but did not indicate when, other than saying he would not lead the party into the next election. On [[February 1]], the Liberal Party Caucus chose [[Bill Graham (politician)|Bill Graham]] as [[parliamentary leader]], meaning he served as [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] until the election of [[Stéphane Dion]] as Liberal leader at the next Liberal Party leadership convention, held [[December 2]] through [[December 3]].

Some political observers had questioned whether Martin would have led the Liberals into an election had the Harper minority fallen in the first few months of the 39th Parliament.[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20060202.LIBERALS02/TPStory/?query=].  In 1979,  [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s Liberals lost to [[Joe Clark]]'s [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]] who only won a minority on [[May 22]] of that year. The Clark minority was defeated less than seven months after on a [[motion of no confidence|confidence vote]] over the budget, which was much earlier than most observers had expected the government to fall. Trudeau had announced his resignation as leader of the Liberals on [[November 21]], [[1979]]; however in light of the collapse of the government on [[December 13]], [[1979]], and the Liberal Party's not having chosen a replacement as leader, Trudeau was persuaded to change his mind, and he led the party into the [[Canadian federal election, 1980|1980 election]] winning a [[majority government]]. Unlike Martin, Trudeau did not appoint an [[interim leader]] or withdraw from the day-to-day leadership of the party after announcing he would resign. 

On [[March 18]], [[2006]] Martin officially tendered his resignation as Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. This move was widely seen as a move by Martin to stop any talk of him leading the party into the next election.

===Five priorities===
Prime Minister Harper has said he will move forward with his top five priorities from the campaign.  At least four of these will require legislative action: the passage of a ''[[Federal Accountability Act]]'' in response to the [[sponsorship scandal]]; combating crime by creating more police officers and setting longer [[mandatory sentencing|mandatory sentences]]; lowering the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods & Services Tax]] to 6% (and eventually to 5%); giving $1,200 for parents per child under the age of 6.  On [[December 6]], [[2006]], another issue many expected to arise in the first session of parliament did, in fact, come to the fore, when the government introduced a motion calling "on the government to introduce legislation to restore the traditional definition of marriage without affecting civil unions and while respecting existing same-sex marriages." [http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/lgc/default.asp?Language=E&Page=newsroom&Sub=speeches&Doc=20061207_marriage_e.htm]  The next day, the House defeated the motion by a vote of 175 to 123, with six cabinet ministers voting against it, and Harper declared the issue settled.[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20061208.SAMESEX08/TPStory/?query=%22same-sex+marriage%22] (See [[Members of the 39th Canadian Parliament and same-sex marriage]] for more information.)

===Jean Lapierre's resignation===
Just a week after [[Wajid Khan]]'s defection to the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], [[Outremont (federal electoral district)|Outremont's]] Liberal MP [[Jean Lapierre]] declared on [[January 11]], [[2007]] that he would resign from the Liberal Party at the end of the month to pursue a career in television. This took place on [[January 28]], leaving the [[Outremont (federal electoral district)|Outremont]] district vacant, and further weakening the Liberal Party by reducing their number of seats to 100. However, rumours have arisen that [[Justin Trudeau]] will run in this riding to fill the vacant seat. The Liberal seat count has since risen to 101, with independent MP Garth Turner (former Conservative MP) of the [[Halton (electoral district)|Halton]] district joining the Liberal Party on [[February 6]], [[2007]].

On [[21 February]] [[2007]], [[Yvan Loubier]] (representing [[Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot]] for the [[Bloc Québécois]]) resigned in order to run in the [[Quebec general election, 2007]].

==Major bills and motions==
Important business of the 39th Parliament includes the following [[Bill (proposed law)|bills]] and [[Motion (democracy)|motions]].  Note that not all of these bills have yet become law.  Motions (excepting those which pass bills) have no effect in law.  A [http://www.parl.gc.ca/LEGISINFO/index.asp?Language=E complete lists of bills] of the 1st session of the 39th Parliament is on the Parliament's website.  The bills are divided into government bills, [[private member's bill]]s, and [[private bill]]s for both the House and the Senate.

===Acts passed by 39th Parliament===
=====Federal Accountability Act=====
Bill C-2, the [[Federal Accountability Act]] (officially ''"An Act providing for conflict of interest rules, restrictions on election financing and measures respecting administrative transparency, oversight and accountability"''), received [[royal assent]] in the Senate on [[December 12]], [[2006]], and is now becoming law.  The act plans to reduce the opportunity to exert influence with money by banning corporate, union, and large personal political donations; create a five-year lobbying ban on former ministers, their aides, and senior public servants; provide protection for whistleblowers; and enhancing the power for the Auditor General to follow the money spent by the government.

=====2006 Canadian federal budget=====
Bill C-13 is The [[2006 Canadian federal budget]], which received [[royal assent]] in the Senate on [[June 22]], [[2006]].

*[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Parl=39&Ses=1&Mode=1&Pub=Bill&Doc=C-13_4 ''full text of bill'']

=====Extending the Afghan War until 2009=====
A successful motion in the House to extend Canada's [[2001 war in Afghanistan|mission in Afghanistan]] by two years, until early 2009.  The motion was supported by the Conservatives and 30 Liberal MPs, allowing it to narrowly pass 149-145 on [[May 17]], [[2006]].<ref>{{Cite news |author=CBC News |publisher=CBC.ca |title=Canada's stay in Afghanistan extended by 2 years |date=May 17, 2006 |accessdate=2006-12-13 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/05/17/afghandebate05172006.html}}</ref>

=====Softwood lumber deal=====
Bill C-24, the ''"Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006"'' put into effect the deal made between the Canadian and American governments regarding the longstanding softwood lumber debates.  The Act received royal assent [[December 14]], [[2006]].

*[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Parl=39&Ses=1&Mode=1&Pub=Bill&Doc=C-24_4 ''full text of bill'']

=====Quebecois nationhood=====
A successful motion in the House to recognise the [[Quebecois]] as a [[Quebec nationalism|nation within Canada]].  The motion was put forth by the Prime Minister in reaction to an announced motion by [[Bloc Quebecois]] leader [[Gilles Duceppe ]] that would recognise Quebec as a nation, but did not contain the words “in Canada” .<ref>{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Sheppard |work=In Depth: The 39th Parliament |title=Quebec nationalism, a long history |publisher=CBC.ca |date=November 23, 2006 |accessdate=2006-12-11 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/parliament39/quebecnation-history.html}}</ref>  The motion easily passed 266 to 16, with all party leaders voting in favour, including Duceppe<ref>{{Cite news |author=CBC News |work=In Depth: The 39th Parliament |title=How each MP voted on Québécois nationhood |publisher=CBC.ca |date=November 28, 2006 |accessdate=2006-12-11 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/parliament39/quebecnation-mpvotes.html}}</ref>

=====Reaffirming the Kyoto Protocol=====
A motion passed by the opposition parties (161 for to 115 against) on [[February 5]], [[2007]] to reaffirm Canada's commitment to the [[Kyoto Protocol]].<ref>{{cite news | author = CBC News | title = House motion passes supporting Kyoto | url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/02/05/kyoto-vote.html | publisher = cbc.ca | date = [[2007-02-05]] | accessdate = 2007-02-05}}</ref>  The motion may not have any legal effect, but it is related to Bill C-288, which is on its second reading in the House and would require the government to work towards meeting its Kyoto targets.

===Failed acts===
=====Re-opening the same-sex marriage debate=====
A failed government motion to reopen the [[same-sex marriage]] debate.  The [[38th Canadian Parliament]], led by the Liberals, had legalised same-sex marriage a year earlier, and many provinces before that.  Harper’s motion to reopen the issue was a promise he made while campaigning, but doing so would likely have been unconstitutional.  The motion failed 175-123, so the issue is closed, again, leaving same-sex marriage legal in Canada.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Canadian Press |authorlink=Canadian Press |publisher=CBC.ca |title=MPs vote against revisiting gay marriage issue |date=December 7, 2006 |accessdate=2006-12-11 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/cp/national/061207/n120751A.html}}</ref>

=====Extending anti-terror laws=====
A failed government motion (159 opposed to 124 in favour) to renew certain sunsetted provisions of the [[Canadian Anti-Terrorism Act|''Anti-terrorism Act'']], first passed by the Liberals after [[9/11]] that suspended some civil liberties in order to combat [[terrorism]].<ref>{{cite news |author=CBC News |title=MPs vote against extending anti-terrorism measures |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/02/27/terror-vote.html |work=CBC.ca |date=[[2007-02-28]] |accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref>

===Acts not yet passed===
=====Minimum penalties for offences involving firearms=====
Bill C-9, titled ''"An Act to amend the Criminal Code (conditional sentence of imprisonment)"'', is a bill to set minimum penalties for offences involving firearms.  Under this act, persons convicted of a serious personal injury offence or a terrorism offence with a term of imprisonment of ten years or more would not be eligible for a [[conditional sentence]].  Bill C-9 passed in the House on [[November 3]], [[2006]] and is now in the committee stage in the Senate.

=====Eight-year Senate terms=====
Bill S-4, titled ''An Act to amend the Constitution Act, 1867 (Senate tenure)'' is a Senate bill to limit new [[Canadian Senate|Senators']] tenure to eight-year terms.  Currently, senators can stay in office until they reach the age of 75.  The bill was was first introduced by the government in the Senate on [[May 30]], [[2006]].  After several months of debates, and consideration of the subject-matter by a special committee, the bill was read a second time on [[February 20]], [[2007]].  At the same time, it was referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for consideration.  It has been suggested that the Liberal Senate will modify the bill to extend the terms to twelve years so that a prime minister would not control the entire Senate after two parliaments.

=====Fixed election dates=====
Bill C-16, titled ''"An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act"'', is a bill to set fixed election dates.  If passed, elections will be held on the third Monday in October in the fourth calendar year following polling day for the last general election.  The next general election under this act would be held on [[October 19]], [[2009]].  Parliament could still be dissolved by a [[motion of non-confidence]].  The provinces of British Columbia, Ontario, and Newfoundland and Labrador have already implemented fixed election dates for their own provincial elections.  Bill C-16 passed in the House on [[November 6]], [[2006]] and the Senate on [[March 28]], [[2007]].  It is now awaiting House approval of the amendments made in the Senate.

=====Age of consent=====
Bill C-22, titled ''"An Act to amend the Criminal Code (age of protection) and to make consequential amendments to the Criminal Records Act"'', is a bill to raise the [[Ages of consent in North America|age of consent]] from 14 to 16.  The bill has been in committee following the [[second reading]] on [[October 30]], [[2006]].

=====Senate Appointment Consultations Act=====
Bill C-43, titled ''"An Act to provide for consultations with electors on their preferences for appointments to the Senate"'', is a bill to hold [[referendum]]s on Senate appointments, introduced [[December 13]], [[2006]].<ref>{{Cite news |author=CTV.ca News Staff |publisher=CTV.ca |title=PM to bring 'democracy' to choice of senators |date=December 13, 2006 |accessdate=2006-12-13 |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061213/senate_elexn_061213/20061213?hub=TopStories}}</ref>  The bill is opposed by Liberals and has stalled after the [[first reading]].
