Córdoba started her political carrier in Medellin working as a community leader in many neighborhoods  along political leader [[William Jaramillo]]. Between 1984 and 1986 Córdoba was appointed to her first public office job, working as a municipal sub-controller.

In 1990 Cordoba postulated her name as candidate for the [[Chamber of Representatives of Colombia]] but did not get enough votes to become elected. A few months later after the congressional elections Cordoba ran for deputy of the Antioquia Department Assembly, this time getting elected.

===Chamber of Representatives 1992===

After the [[Constituent Assembly of Colombia]] adopted the new [[Colombian Constitution of 1991|Constitution of 1991]], Córdoba ran for congress once again for the Chamber of Representatives for the period 1992-1994. In 1994 her political mentor William Jaramillo announced that he was not going to seek a reelection and Córdoba assumed his role. She was elected to the Senate for the 1994-1998 period receiving most of her votes from the [[Departments of Colombia|Departments]] of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] and [[Choco Department|Choco]].

She made part of the popular inter-parliamentary group that promotes government policies on [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. In 1995, Córdoba participated in the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in [[Beijing]], [[PRC|China]].

In 1998 Córdoba was reelected as senator. She promoted debates focused on minorities and communitarian mothers groups, as well as the resolution of the [[Colombian armed conflict]] through talk negotiations. 

;Kidnapping

In 1999 [[Carlos Castaño]], leader of the paramilitary group [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia]] (AUC), kidnapped Senator Córdoba.

;Death threats and political ban through coercion

As congresswoman she has supported projects that focused mainly on "communitary mothers", women head of households, Afro-Colombian communities, [[LGBT in Colombia|LGBT groups]], groups against family violence and corruption.

==== Controversy in Mexico ====

On [[March 11]], [[2007]], Córdoba assisted a symposium in [[Mexico City]] called ''Los Partidos Políticos y una Nueva Ciudad'' (Political parties and a new city) which was said by the colombian government to be supported by guerrilla groups from Colombia, the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC) and the [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|National Liberation Army]] (ELN), both considered terrorist organizations by the US government and the European Union. Córdoba generated controversy after declaring that "the progressive governments of Latin America should break their diplomatic relations with Colombia" and also that [[Álvaro Uribe]] was a "paramilitary". <ref>Élber Gutiérrez Roa, [http://www.semana.com/wf_InfoArticulo.aspx?idArt=101537  Declaraciones de Piedad Córdoba en México profundizan diferencias con el Partido Liberal], ''[[Revista Semana]]'', March 13, 2007</ref>

The head of the [[Colombian Liberal Party|Liberal Party]], [[César Gaviria]], rejected Córdoba's opinions<ref>{{es icon}} Asdrúbal Guerra, [http://www.wradio.com.co/nota.asp?id=401589 Partido Liberal descalifica a Piedad Córdoba por declaraciones contra Gobierno], ''[[W Radio (Colombia)]]'', March 13, 2007</ref>. Córdoba was later judicially denounced for [[treason]] after making these declarations, a charge which is currently being investigated by Colombia's Supreme Court. 

==== Humanitarian exchange negotiator ====

{{main|Humanitarian exchange}}

On [[August 16]], [[2007]], President Uribe in a surprising move appointed Córdoba as mediator in the [[humanitarian exchange]] in an effort negotiate the freedom of some 50 (number at the time) hostages held by FARC and the possible release of some 500 guerrillas imprisoned by the government.<ref>[http://www.analitica.com/mujeranalitica/noticias/3497120.asp {{es icon}} Analitica: Colombia: Uribe nombra senadora cercana a Chávez como facilitadora ante FARC]</ref> Córdoba then asked the [[President of Venezuela]] [[Hugo Chávez]] to mediate also, with the support of President Uribe. 

Córdoba then interned in the jungles of Colombia and met with alias [[Raul Reyes]], spokesman and leader of the FARC, to coordinate a meeting with president Chávez in Venezuela.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2007/09/17/elmundo/i-02501.htm {{es icon}} Clarín: Las FARC se reúnen en la selva con la mediadora]</ref> In Venezuela, Chávez and Córdoba met with [[Rodrigo Granda]] and [[Ivan Marquez]] among other members of the guerrilla as part of the negotiations. Photos of Cordoba and the guerrillas surfaced in an online website called ''Agencia Bolivariana de Prensa'' (ABP) which showed Córdoba in an amicable and cordial relationship with the FARC, receiving flowers, kisses and hugs. This generated controversy among the government and other critics. <ref>[http://www.europapress.es/00407/20071112211642/colombia-revelan-imagenes-encuentro-senadora-colombiana-piedad-cordoba-delegados-farc.html {{es icon}} europress.es: senadora colombiana Piedad Córdoba y delegados de las FARC]</ref>, to which she responded that the photos "were taken out of context"  .

On [[November 22]], President Uribe abruptly ended the mediation after Chávez called the high command of the Colombian military. Uribe had conditioned Chávez against any attempt to talk to military high command without going through appropriate diplomatic channels. 
Chávez initially accepted the decision but afterwards reacted by pulling his ambassador from Bogota, then proceeded to verbally attack Uribe by calling him a "pawn of the empire" and literally cut any contact with the Colombian government, including rejecting calls from the Colombian embassy in Caracas. He decided to stop diplomatic relations between the two countries and even announced his intent to sharply reduce bilateral commerce..<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | pages=1 | title=Escaramuzas Vervales | date=January 26, 2008 | publisher=[[Revista Semana]] | url=http://www.semana.com/wf_InfoArticulo.aspx?idArt=109049}}</ref>  

On [[December 20]], [[2007]], Córdoba accused an unspecified "top Colombian government official", of orchestrating an assassination attempt towards her on Venezuelan soil. This accusation sparked a confrontation with [[Juan Manuel Santos]], the Minister of Defense, who had previously been the subject of other allegations made by Córdoba. So far no proof or testimony about the alleged conspiracy is known. <ref> Santos dice que Piedad lo acusa en voz baja, ella se declara sorprendida, http://www.eltiempo.com/tiempoimpreso/edicionimpresa/politica/2007-12-21/ARTICULO-WEB-NOTA_INTERIOR-3868897.html</ref>

After the end of her official role as a mediator, Córdoba has accused President [[Álvaro Uribe]], the Minister of Defense and the [[Colombian Armed Forces]] of engaging in military operations or otherwise obstructing announced hostage releases.

==== Alleged "farcopolitics" ====

On [[April 24]], [[2008]] the Colombian government releases files from the previously murdered FARC commander [[Raúl Reyes]], implicating Córdoba as having friendly ties with the guerrillas. As Teodora de Bolivar, the Senator is mentioned as one of the twelve people of the transitional government, set up by the FARC after they are able to seize power in Colombia. The files would also show she received money from Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez]] to set up several social projects in het department. The Colombian Supreme Court immediately asks insight in the files to establish there are reasons for a criminal investigation, but the Colombian government first wants the files to be supported by [[Interpol]]. According Córdoba the revelations are no more than a "smokescreen" to divert attention from the [[Colombian parapolitics scandal]] that is severely hurting the current Uribe Administration. <ref>{{cite news
