[[Admiral of the Fleet]] '''Louis Alexander Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Milford Haven''', [[Order of the Bath|GCB]], [[Royal Victorian Order|GCVO]], [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]], [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]] ([[24 May]] [[1854]] &ndash; [[11 September]] [[1921]]), formerly '''Prince Louis Alexander of Battenberg''', was a minor [[Germany|German]] [[prince]] who married a granddaughter of Britain's [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and pursued a distinguished career in the United Kingdom's [[Royal Navy]], becoming a protégé of his future king, [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]].

Although the Queen felt he was discriminated against because of his princely title and therefore occasionally intervened to promote his career, Louis welcomed battle assignments that provided opportunities for him to acquire the skills of war and to demonstrate to his superiors that he was serious about his naval career. Posts on royal yachts and tours actually impeded his progress, but it would have been ungrateful as well as unwise to demur. He eventually served as [[Admiralty|First Sea Lord]] from 1912 to 1914.

He was the father of [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|the 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] and of [[Louise Mountbatten|Queen Louise of Sweden]], and was the maternal grandfather of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], consort of Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]]. One of his younger brothers, [[Alexander of Bulgaria|Prince Alexander of Battenberg]] ([[1857]]-[[1893]]), was selected with the approval of Europe's [[Power (international)|Great Powers]] to mount the throne of [[Bulgaria]], where he reigned as [[Prince|sovereign Prince]] from [[1879]] to [[1886]]. 

==Early life==
''His [[Illustrious Highness]] [[Count]] Louis (Ludwig) Alexander of [[Battenberg]]'' was born in [[Graz]], [[Austria]], the eldest son of [[Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine]] ([[1823]]-[[1888]]) by his [[morganatic marriage]] to [[Count|Countess]] [[Julia von Hauke]] ([[1825]]-[[1895]]). Denied his father's [[dynastic]] rights and [[Royal and noble ranks|rank]] in [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse]], from birth he shared the countly title and "Illustrious" [[Honorific|style]] conferred upon his mother at the time of her marriage, automatically becoming ''[[Serene Highness|His Serene Highness]] Prince Louis of Battenberg'' when she was elevated to ''Princess of Battenberg'' with the style of ''Serene Highness'' by decree of her husband's brother, Grand Duke Ludwig III of Hesse and by Rhine on [[21 December]] [[1858]]. 

Shortly after his birth, Louis's father was stationed with the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] of occupation in Northern [[Italy]] during the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], and Louis's early years were spent either there or at Prince Alexander's house in Hesse, Heiligenberg. His mother spoke French to him but he had an English governess, and as a consequence grew up trilingual.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kerr|first=Mark|title=Prince Louis of Battenberg|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co|year=1934|pages=pp.4-5}}</ref>

==Early naval career==
[[Image:LouisofBattenberg1869.jpg|thumb|Prince Louis of Battenberg photographed by Carl Backofen in Darmstadt, 1869]]

Influenced by his cousin's wife, the future [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom|Grand Duchess Alice of Hesse]], a daughter of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s, and Prince Alfred, another of Queen Victoria's children, Louis became a naturalized [[United Kingdom|British]] subject and joined the [[Royal Navy]] in October 1868, at the age of fourteen. He was enlisted as a naval cadet aboard HMS ''[[HMS Victory|Victory]]'', [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]]'s old flagship.<ref>Kerr, pp.7-8</ref> In January of the following year, the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]] cruised the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Black Sea]]s in the frigate ''Ariadne'', and the Prince of Wales requested that Louis be appointed to the vessel.<ref>Kerr, p.9-10</ref> As part of the same tour, Louis also accompanied them on a visit to [[Egypt]], visiting the construction site of the [[Suez canal]]. As was traditional the [[Khedive]] bestowed honours on the party and Louis received the Medjidieh (Fourth Class).<ref>Kerr, p.14-16</ref> In April, he received the Osmanieh (Fourth Class) from the [[Ottoman Sultan]].<ref>Kerr, p.18</ref>

Having returned to Britain in May, in June he was appointed to the ''Royal Alfred'', the flagship of the [[North America]] and [[West Indies]] station, where he was rated as [[midshipman]] in October.<ref>Kerr, p.19-23</ref> From June to September 1870 he took leave in [[Germany]], coinciding with the [[Franco-Prussian war]].<ref>Kerr, pp.25-27</ref> He spent the next three-and-a-half years in the Americas, returning to Europe in early 1874, he was promoted to Sub-Lieutenant and posted to the shore establishment HMS ''[[HMS Excellent|Excellent]]''.<ref>Kerr, p.34 and p.xiii</ref>

In [[1875]], again at the invitation of the Prince of Wales he joined the ''[[HMS Serapis (1866)|Serapis]]'', the ship which conducted the [[Prince of Wales]] on an official tour of [[India]], 1875-1876.<ref>Kerr, p.36</ref> The Prince asked Louis to stay with him at [[Marlborough House]] for the summer of 1876, but wishing to gain further experience at sea, Louis turned him down and instead accepted an offer to join [[Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh]] as a Lieutenant onboard the ''[[HMS Sultan (1870)|Sultan]]''.<ref>Kerr, p.51</ref> In addition to acting as the Duke's equerry, Louis had to continue with his naval duties. He did not enjoy the position, as the Duke was rather touchy<ref>Kerr, p.63</ref> and Louis's cabin was infested with rats, one of which he caught with his bare hands in bed as it ran across his chest.<ref>Kerr, p.64</ref> The ''Sultan'' toured the Mediterranean from July 1876.<ref>Kerr, p.51</ref> In late February-early March 1878 Louis was still serving on the ''Sultan'' as it lay in the [[Bosphorus]] during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish war]]. He was criticized for visiting his brother, [[Alexander of Bulgaria|Prince Alexander]], who was serving with the Russian forces, but an investigation cleared both of them and Prince Alfred of any wrongdoing.<ref>Kerr, p.69</ref> For the next two years he served on the ''[[HMS Agincourt (1865)|Agincourt]]'' and on the Royal Yacht ''Osborne''. But in October 1879 he refused further service on the Royal Yacht, saying it was damaging his professional career, and requested half-pay until he could be given an active duty.<ref>Kerr, p.70</ref>

[[Image:HMS Agincourt.jpg|thumb|left|240px|HMS ''Agincourt'' c.1878]]

On [[August 24]] [[1880]] Louis was posted to the ''[[HMS Inconstant|Inconstant]]'', the flag-ship of the Flying Squadron, which included ''Bacchante'' on which Princes [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence|Albert Victor]] and [[George V of the United Kingdom|George]] were serving. The ship sailed to [[South America]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Fiji]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]], before returning to [[South Africa]] in April 1882.<ref>Kerr, pp.71-99</ref> Seven months after Prince Louis of Battenberg had left Britain on the voyage, actress [[Lillie Langtry]] allegedly bore him an illegitimate daughter, [[Jeanne Marie Langtry]]. Mrs. Langtry was also a one-time mistress of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Albert Edward, Prince of Wales]]. As to whether Prince Louis was in fact the father has never been completely verified but a financial settlement was made.<ref name="dnb">{{citation |last=Hurd |first=Archibald |title=Mountbatten, Louis Alexander, first marquess of Milford Haven [formerly Prince Louis of Battenberg] (1854–1921) |coauthors=rev. John Van der Kiste |journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 }}</ref>

From South Africa the ''Inconstant'' sailed to [[St Helena]], and the [[Cape Verde]] Islands, where the squadron received orders to proceed to [[Gibraltar]], and from there to [[Malta]] and Egypt to take part in the [[1882]] Egyptian intervention.<ref>Kerr, p.100</ref> On [[11 July]] [[Alexandria]] was bombarded and in the next two weeks Louis served in the Flying Squadron delivering shells and ammunition to the battle fleet, and then as a guard to the Khedive at [[Ras Al Teen Palace]].<ref>Kerr, p.101</ref> He was decorated with the Egyptian Medal and the Khedive Bronze Star. 

In November 1882 he left the ''Inconstant'', spent Christmas in [[Darmstadt]], and in March the following year visited his brother, Prince Alexander, in [[Bulgaria]], where Alexander had just been made Sovereign Prince.<ref>Kerr, p.103</ref> Louis accompanied his brother on a state visit to [[Turkey]] and then on a Turkish navy tour of [[Cyprus]] and the [[Holy Land]], during which Louis was appalled at the lack of seamanship &mdash; the Turkish captains were unable to navigate and had to hug the coast in order not to get lost, when they did leave the coast they became so disoriented they were unable to steer for [[Jaffa]]. On its return journey the ship they had travelled on grounded.<ref>Kerr, p.106</ref>

==Marriage and Children==
[[Image:LouisofBattenberg1884.jpg|thumb|Prince Louis of Battenberg photographed by Elliott and Fry in London, 1884]]

In September 1883, Queen Victoria appointed him to her yacht, ''Victoria and Albert''. On [[30 April]] [[1884]] in the presence of the Queen, Prince Louis married [[Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine]] ([[5 April]] [[1863]]-[[24 September]] [[1950]]) at [[Darmstadt]].<ref>Kerr, p.107</ref> His wife was the eldest daughter of Queen Victoria's second daughter [[Princess Alice of Great Britain and Ireland|Alice]] ([[26 April]] [[1843]]-[[14 December]] [[1878]]), by [[Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse]] ([[12 September]] [[1837]]-[[13 March]] [[1892]]). Prince and Princess Louis of Battenberg were first cousins once removed. Louis and Victoria invariably spoke English to each other.<ref>Kerr, p.109</ref>

Their marriage produced four children:
*HSH Princess [[Princess Alice of Battenberg|Alice]] ([[15 February]] [[1885]]-[[5 December]] [[1969]]) m. HRH [[Prince Andrew of Greece|Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark]] ([[2 February]] [[1882]]-[[3 December]] [[1944]]). Among her children is [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]];
*HSH Princess [[Louise Mountbatten|Louise]], later styled Lady Louise Mountbatten ([[13 July]] [[1889]]-[[2 March]] [[1965]]) m. Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden, later King [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf VI Adolf]] ([[11 November]] [[1882]]-[[15 September]] [[1973]]);
*HSH Prince [[George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven|George]], who became George Mountbatten, Earl of Medina in 1917, and succeeded his father as 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven in 1921, ([[6 November]] [[1892]]-[[4 April]] [[1938]]) m. [[Nadejda Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven|Countess Nadejda (Nada) de Torby]] ([[28 March]] [[1896]]-[[22 January]] [[1963]]); and
*HSH Prince [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Francis]], later 1st Viscount Mountbatten of Burma and 1st [[Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] ([[25 June]] [[1900]]-[[August 27]] [[1979]]) m. Edwina Ashley ([[28 November]] [[1900]]-[[21 February]] [[1960]]).<ref>She was co-heiress of the vast banking fortune of her maternal grandfather, [[Ernest Cassel|Sir Ernest Cassel]]; daughter of Wilfred Ashley, later [[Baron Mount Temple]]; and male-line great-granddaughter of the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|7th Earl of Shaftesbury]].</ref>

==Later naval career==
[[Image:HMSDreadnought1875.jpeg|thumb|left|220px|HMS ''Dreadnought'' c.1894]]

On his penultimate day aboard the Queen's yacht, [[August 30]] [[1885]], he was promoted to [[Commander]].<ref>Kerr, p.xii</ref> The next four years were spent on half-pay, in ''[[HMS Excellent|Excellent]]'' and ''Vernon'', at HMS ''Cambridge'' very briefly at [[Milford Haven]] in August 1886, and onboard [[HMS Dreadnought (1875)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']] in the Mediterranean.<ref>Kerr, p.xiii and p.110</ref> [[Irish nationalist]] [[Member of Parliament]] [[William Hoey Kearney Redmond|Willie Redmond]] questioned the appointment to ''Dreadnought'' in the [[British House of Commons]], suggesting it was due to royal favour &mdash; a suggestion denied by the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], [[Lord George Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ziegler|first=Philip|authorlink=Philip Ziegler|title=Mountbatten|publisher=Collins|year=1985|pages=p.23|isbn=0002165430}}</ref> On [[October 3]] [[1889]] he was appointed to his first independent command &mdash; HMS ''Scout'', a torpedo-cruiser, which saw service in the [[Red Sea]].<ref>Kerr, pp.111-114</ref>

On [[December 31]] [[1891]] Prince Louis rose to the rank of [[captain]]<ref>Kerr, p.166</ref> and became an aide-de-camp to the Queen, a post he would retain under both King Edward VII and [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]].<ref>Kerr, p.138</ref> At the beginning of the following year, he was appointed naval advisor to the inspector-general of fortifications. His role was to liaise between the navy and the military in order to ensure a co-ordinated defence.<ref name="dnb" /> Traditionally, there was a great deal of friction between the two services, but Prince Louis exercised his social skills in the role, leading [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge]] to write to him, "You have produced a mutual feeling of goodwill and unanimity which I have always wished to see established, and which, by your tact and sound judgement, you have brought about to the fullest extent."<ref>Kerr, p.118</ref> By February 1894 this role was further developed when he was appointed joint secretary of the naval and military committee on defence, which was later renamed the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]].<ref name="dnb" /> Prince Louis captained the ''Cambrian'' in the Mediterranean Fleet from October 1894 to May 1897 and the ''[[HMS Majestic (1895)|Majestic]]'' in the Channel Fleet from June 1897.<ref>Kerr, pp.121-122</ref> His careful study of both naval and military defence, as well as its interaction, led to his appointment as Assistant Director of the [[Naval Intelligence Division]] in June 1899.<ref>Kerr, p.xiv</ref>

After a year as captain of [[HMS Implacable (1899)|HMS ''Implacable'']] in the Mediterranean, Prince Louis was appointed as [[Naval Intelligence Division (UK)|Director of Naval Intelligence]] in November 1902.<ref>Kerr, pp.142-157</ref> He was promoted to [[Rear Admiral|rear admiral]] in [[1904]], in which year his family connections to the royal courts of Europe help resolve the [[Dogger Bank incident]] peacefully.<ref name="dnb" /> The following February he was given command of the second cruiser squadron, with [[HMS Drake|HMS ''Drake'']] as his flag ship. During a successful two years the squadron visited [[Greece]], [[Portugal]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]], where the American press commented favourably on Prince Louis's courtesy, unassuming manner and democratic nature.<ref>Kerr, p.185-206</ref> After further visits to [[Spain]] (where his niece [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]] was Queen) he was appointed second-in-command of the [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean fleet]] as acting vice-admiral after two years at the head of the second cruiser squadron.<ref>Kerr, pp.214-221</ref>

After less than six months in post his flag was transferred to [[HMS Prince of Wales (1902)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']] as Commander-in-Chief, [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]] in August 1907.<ref>Kerr, p.xiv</ref>  In 1909 he published a translation of Commander Vladimir Semenoff's ''Rasplata'' (The Reckoning), a memoir of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904-5, and witnessed the first crossing of the [[English Channel]] by air by [[Louis Blériot]].<ref>Kerr, pp.230-231</ref>  He was appointed as commander of the newly constituted Third and Fourth Divisions of the [[Home Fleet]] two years later in 1911. In December that year he returned to the [[Admiralty]] as [[Second Sea Lord]].  He became a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (K.C.B.) in the military division in 1908, having received the K.C.B. and Knight Grand Cross (G.C.B.) in the civil division of the same order in 1884 and 1887, respectively. 

On [[8 December]] [[1912]], Prince Louis assumed the post of First Sea Lord, the senior uniformed officer in the Royal Navy, in succession to Admiral Sir Francis Bridgeman, who had retired in ill-health.<ref>Kerr, p.238</ref>  In that capacity, he was responsible to the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] (at the time, [[Winston Churchill]]) for the readiness of the fleet and the preparation of naval strategy.  On the eve of [[World War I]] he unilaterally<ref>Churchill was away for the weekend (25-27 July) but was consulted.</ref> made the crucial decision to cancel the scheduled dispersal of the British fleet following practice manoeuvres in order to preserve the Royal Navy's battle readiness,<ref>Kerr, p.243</ref><ref name="dnb" /> despite the fact that this was likely to be construed as a provocative act by Germany.  Nonetheless, with the outbreak of war, rising anti-German sentiment among the British public, newspapers, and elite [[Gentlemen's club (traditional)|gentlemen's club]]s (where resentment was inflamed by Admiral [[Lord Charles Beresford]] despite Churchill's remonstrances) drove Churchill to ask Prince Louis to resign as [[First Sea Lord]] on [[29 October]] [[1914]], which he did amidst an outpouring of appreciation from politicians and his naval comrades.  [[George V of the United Kingdom|The King]] swore Louis in as a [[Privy Council]]lor in a public show of support.<ref name="dnb" /> [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] party politician and [[trade union]] leader, [[James Henry Thomas|J. H. Thomas]] wrote to ''[[The Times]]'': "I desire to express my extreme regret at the announcement that Prince Louis of Battenberg has, by his resignation, pandered to the most mean and contemptible slander I have ever known … I was simply astounded to hear the base suggestions and rumours current, and I am afraid that his action will simply be looked upon as a triumph for the mean and miserable section of people, who, at a time of national trial, is ever ready to pass a foul lie from lip to lip without a tittle of evidence."<ref>''The Times (London)'' [[November 4]] [[1914]]</ref> [[Lord John Hay (admiral of the fleet)|Admiral of the Fleet John Hay]] thought that the "ingeniously propagated lies" originated from [[German Empire|Germany]].<ref>''The Times (London)'' [[November 1]] [[1914]]</ref> Prince Louis held no official post for the remainder of the war and lived in retirement at Kent House on the [[Isle of Wight]].<ref>Kerr, p.259</ref> He occupied his time in writing a comprehensive encyclopedia on Naval Medals published in three large volumes, which became the standard reference work on the subject.<ref>Kerr, p.265</ref> His naval career had been characterised by industry, invention and intellect; he introduced mechanical calculators to compute navigations and a cone signalling apparatus.<ref name="dnb" /> Although assured that he would be returned to command post-war, he was asked to retire from the Navy's active list in 1918.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

== Adoption of the Surname Mountbatten ==
[[Image:George V of the United Kingdom - Punch cartoon - Project Gutenberg eText 16113.png|right|thumb|200px|<center>A 1917 ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon depicting King George V abolishing the German titles held by members of his family.]]

Persistent rumors that the [[British Royal Family]] must be pro-German given their dynastic origins and many German relatives, prompted the King to abandon his subsidiary German dynastic titles and adopt an [[House of Windsor|English surname]].  At the behest of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], Louis relinquished the title Prince of Battenberg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse, as also the style of Serene Highness, on [[14 July]] [[1917]].  At the same time, Louis also anglicized his family name, changing it from "[[Battenberg family|Battenberg]]" to "[[Mountbatten]]," having considered but rejected "Battenhill" as an alternative.  On [[17 July]], the king created him ''[[Marquess of Milford Haven]], Earl of Medina, and Viscount Alderney'' in the [[peerage of the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/archiveViewFrameSetup.asp?IssueNumber=30374&pageNumber=6&SearchFor=&PageDuplicate=n&selMedalType=&selHonourType=|accessdate=2007-03-13|title=The London Gazette|date=[[9 November]] [[1917]]|pages=Issue: 30374, p.6}}</ref> The King's British relatives in the [[Teck]], [[House of Oldenburg|Schleswig-Holstein]] and [[Gleichen]] families underwent similar changes.  Louis's wife ceased to use her own title of Princess of Hesse and became known as the Marchioness of Milford Haven.  His three younger children ceased to use their princely titles and assumed courtesy titles as children of a British marquess; his eldest daughter, Princess Alice, had married into the Greek royal family in [[1903]], and never had occasion to use the surname Mountbatten.  However, her only son, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] of Greece and Denmark, adopted the name when he became a British subject in 1947.

While the transition in names and titles was being effected, Louis spent some time at the home of his eldest son, George, who had married [[Nadejda Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven|Countess Nadejda (Nada) de Torby]] the year before.<ref>Nada de Torby ([[28 March]] [[1896]]-[[22 January]] [[1963]]) was the [[Morganatic branches of the Russian Imperial Family|morganatic]] daughter of [[Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich Romanov|Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich of Russia]] by Countess Sophie von Merenberg, Countess Torby, herself the daughter of a morganatic marriage between [[Prince]] Nicholas of [[Duke of Nassau|Nassau]] and Natalia Aleksandrovna Pushkin, daughter of [[Aleksandr Pushkin|Russia's most renowned author]], and great-granddaughter of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]'s African protégé, [[Abram Petrovich Gannibal]].</ref> After anglicizing his surname to ''Mountbatten'' and becoming Marquess of Milford Haven, Prince Louis wrote in his son's guestbook, "Arrived Prince Hyde, Departed Lord [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Jekyll]]".<ref>Kerr, p.289</ref>

During the war two of Louis's sister-in-laws were murdered by the [[Bolshevik]]s in Russia. Eventually, in January 1921, after a long and convoluted journey, the body of his sister-in-law [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna]] of Russia was interred in [[Jerusalem]] in Prince and Princess Louis's presence.<ref>Kerr, p.261</ref>

In 1919 the Mountbattens had to give up their home, Kent House, for financial reasons.<ref>Kerr, p.290</ref> He sold his collection of naval medals.  All of his financial investments in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] were seized by the Bolsheviks and his German property became valueless with the collapse of the [[German Papiermark|mark]].<ref name="end">Kerr, p.293</ref>

Lord Milford Haven was appointed a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] and was promoted to the rank of [[Admiral of the Fleet]] in recognition of his service to the [[Royal Navy]] on [[22 August]] [[1921]].  He died at 42 Half Moon Street, [[Piccadilly]], [[London]] in the annexe of the [[Naval & Military Club]] on [[11 September]] [[1921]] of heart failure following [[influenza]]. After a funeral service at [[Westminster Abbey]], his remains were buried at Whippingham Church on the [[Isle of Wight]].<ref name="end" />

Prince Louis's elder son, [[George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven|George Mountbatten]], who received the courtesy title Earl of Medina, succeeded him as 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven. [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Prince Louis's younger son]], styled Lord Louis Mountbatten after [[1917]], was created Viscount Mountbatten of Burma in [[1946]] and then Earl Mountbatten of Burma and Baron Romsey in [[1947]]. He served as the last [[Viceroy of India]].

One of Prince Louis's younger brothers, [[Prince Henry of Battenberg]] ([[1858]]-[[1896]]), married [[Princess Beatrice, Princess Henry of Battenberg|Princess Beatrice]], the youngest child of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], and took up residence with the Queen in Britain so that his wife could continue to serve as her mother's companion and private secretary.  His youngest brother, [[Prince Francis Joseph of Battenberg]] [[1861]]-[[1924]] earned a doctorate based on a dissertation about his brother's reign in Bulgaria, wed [[Royal Highness|HRH]] Princess Anna Petrović Njegoš [[1874]]-[[1971]] in [[1897]], a daughter of King [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]], and took up residence in [[Switzerland]].  His only sister, Princess Marie, wed the head of a [[Mediatization|mediatized]] family, Count Gustaf zu Erbach-Schoenberg, who was elevated, along with the couple's male-line descendants, to [[Fürst|Prince]] and [[Serene Highness]] by her cousin, [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], in 1903. Marie's memoirs have been published in German and English, and include an account of the family's visit to the ruins of the castle of Battenberg in Hesse. 

Of the family's two residences in Hesse, the Alexander Palace in Darmstadt returned to the grand duchy as part of the [[Appanage|appanaged]] patrimony of Louis's father, [[Alexander of Hesse-Darmstadt|Prince Alexander]], from which his children by Julie Hauke were debarred. However, the castle of Heiligenberg in Jugenheim had been bequeathed to Prince Alexander as personal property.  During the 1870s, [[Maria Alexandrovna|Empress Marie Aleksandrovna]], née Princess of Hesse, brought her husband, [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]], her numerous children and a large retinue for annual visits to her brother's little chateau at Heiligenberg, evoking visits from foreign kings, diplomats and matchmaking mothers eager to pay their respects to Russia's Emperor without having to actually travel all the way there. Not only did these visits put the Hessian grandduchy "on the map", but they enhanced the prestige of the Battenbergs on the Continent.  But joint possession of a German property by Louis and Henry in England with their Continental siblings during the Great War proved an untenable embarrassment, so it was sold.{{fact|date=March 2007}}
