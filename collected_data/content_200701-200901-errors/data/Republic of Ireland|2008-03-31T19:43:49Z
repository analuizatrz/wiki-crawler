'''Ireland''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: ''[[Éire]]'', {{pronounced|ˈeːrʲə}}) is a country in north-western [[Europe]]. The modern [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] [[state]] occupies five-sixths of the island of [[Ireland]], which was [[Partition of Ireland|partitioned]] in 1921. It is bordered by [[Northern Ireland]] (part of the [[United Kingdom]]) to the north, by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west and by the [[Irish Sea]] to the east. Legally, the term ''Republic of Ireland'' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: ''Poblacht na hÉireann'') is the ''description'' of the State but ''Ireland'' is its ''name''.<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1948/en/act/pub/0022/sec0002.html#zza22y1948s2 Section 2] of the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]] (Irl).</ref>

Ireland is one of the richest, most developed and peaceful countries on earth, having the fifth highest [[Gross Domestic Product]] per capita, second highest Gross Domestic Product (Purchasing Power Parity) per capita and having the fifth highest [[Human Development Index]] rank. The country also boasts the highest quality of life in the world, ranking first in the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]’s [[Quality-of-life index]]. Ireland was ranked fourth on the [[Global Peace Index]]. Ireland also has high rankings for its education system, political freedom and civil rights, press freedom and economic freedom; it was also ranked fourth from the bottom on the [[List of countries by Failed States Index|Failed States Index]], being one of the few "sustainable" states in the world.

Ireland is a member of the [[European Union|EU]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] and the [[United Nations|UN]]. Ireland's [[Irish neutrality|policy of neutrality]] means it is not a member of [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation|NATO]]. Ireland's population is the fastest growing in Europe, with an annual growth rate of 2.5%.  

==Name==
{{main|Names of the Irish state}}
Article 4 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish constitution]], which was adopted in 1937, provides that “the name of the state is ''Éire'', or, in the English language, ''Ireland''”.<ref>The wording of Article 4 has been criticised. Most recently, in its report, the [http://www.constitution.ie/constitutional-reviews/crg.asp Constitution Review Group]in 1996 stated that that Article 4 was unnecessarily complicated and should be amended to read ''”The name of the state is Ireland”'' with an equivalent change in the Irish text.</ref> For all official purposes including in international treaties and in other legal documents, where the language of the documents is English, the Irish government uses the name ''Ireland''. The same is true in respect of the name ''Éire'' for documents written in Irish. Institutions of the [[European Union]] follow the same practice. Since Irish became an official [[EU]] language on 1 January 2007, at [[EU]] meetings name plates for the state read as ''Éire - Ireland'', just as the two official names are used on [[Irish passport]]s.<ref>Ireland joined the EU (then [[EEC]]) in 1973 under a treaty drawn up in several languages including Irish and English. Since then, its two names have been official in the EU. Irish became an official working language of the European Union on 1 January 2007 and consequently both names are now used on nameplates. This did not change the name of Ireland in EU law. For further consideration of the practice applied by the European Union, see [http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-370100.htm Clause 7.1.1 of the Inter Institutional Style Guide].</ref> 

Since 1949 the [[Republic of Ireland Act]] has provided that the ''Republic of Ireland'' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: ''Poblacht na hÉireann'') is the official ''description'' for the state. The Act was intended primarily to declare that Ireland was a [[republic]] rather than a form of [[constitutional monarchy]]. It provided the state’s official ''description'' but it did not change its ''name''.

What is now ''Ireland'' has been known by a range of other names, all of which are still sometimes used unofficially. The whole island of Ireland was unilaterally [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic| proclaimed]] an independent republic by rebels in 1916 and styled as the ''[[Irish Republic]]'' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: ''Poblacht na hÉireann'', subsequently also ''Saorstát Éireann''). Following the [[1918 general election]], that [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic| proclamation]] was ratified by a large majority of the Irish [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom| Members of Parliament]]. Between 1921 and 1922, when the British government legislated to establish what is now  ''Ireland'' as an autonomous region of the United Kingdom, it was given the name  ''[[Southern Ireland]]''. Following the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]], from 1922 until 1937, as a [[dominion]] in  the [[British Commonwealth]], it was styled as the ''[[Irish Free State]]'' ([[Irish language|Irish]]:''Saorstát Éireann''). That name was abolished when the current [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish constitution]] was adopted. Other colloquial names such as the ''Twenty-Six Counties'' and  ''The South'' (a name frequently used by people in [[Northern Ireland]]) are also often used.

==History==
{{main|History of the Republic of Ireland|History of Ireland}}

Ireland is the successor-state to the Dominion called the [[Irish Free State]]. That Dominion came into being when all of the island of Ireland seceded from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] on 6 December 1922. However, the following day the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] exercised its right under the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] to opt back into the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|United Kingdom]].<ref>[http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=2&pageno=1145#bak-2-1149 Northern Ireland Parliamentary Report, 7 December 1922]</ref> This action, known as the [[Partition of Ireland]], followed four attempts to introduce [[Irish Home Rule Bill|devolved autonomous government]] over the whole island of Ireland (in 1886, 1893, 1914 and 1920). The [[Irish Free State]] was abolished when Ireland was formally established on 29 December 1937, the day its [[Constitution of Ireland| constitution]] came into force. 

Irish independence in 1922 was preceded by the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916, when Irish volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army took over sites in Dublin and Galway under terms expressed in the [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic]]. The seven signatories of this proclamation, [[Patrick Pearse]], [[Thomas MacDonagh]], [[Thomas Clarke]], [[Sean MacDiarmada]], [[Joseph Plunkett]], [[Eamonn Ceannt]] and [[James Connolly]], were executed, along with nine others, and thousands were interned precipitating the [[Irish War of Independence]].

===Early background===
From the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] on [[1 January]] [[1801]] until [[6 December]] [[1922]], Ireland had been part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. During the [[Irish Potato Famine|Great Famine]] from 1845 to 1849 the island's population of over 8 million fell by 30 percent. One million Irish died of starvation and another 1.5 million emigrated,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mokyr|first = Joel|authorlink = Joel Mokyr|title = New Developments in Irish Population History 1700-1850|journal = Irish Economic and Social History|volume = xi|pages = 101-121|date=  1984}}</ref> which set the pattern of emigration for the century to come and would result in a constant decline up to the 1960s. From 1874, but particularly from 1880 under [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] moved to prominence through widespread [[Irish Land League|agrarian agitation]] that won improved tenant [[Irish Land Acts|land reforms]] and with its attempts to win two [[Irish Home Rule Bill|Home Rule Bills]], which would have granted Ireland limited national autonomy within the United Kingdom. These nevertheless led to the “grass-roots” control of national affairs under the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]] previously in the hands of landlord dominated [[Protestant Ascendancy|grand juries]].
{{Life in the Republic of Ireland}}
===Home Rule statute===
Home Rule seemed certain in 1911 when the [[House of Lords]] [[Parliament Act|lost their veto]], and [[John Redmond]] secured the Third [[Home Rule Act 1914]]. The [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist movement]], however, had been growing since 1886 among Irish [[Protestant]]s after the introduction of the first home rule bill, fearing that they would face discrimination and lose economic and social privileges if Irish [[Catholics]] were to achieve real political power. Though Irish unionism existed throughout the whole of Ireland, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century unionism was particularly strong in parts of [[Ulster Unionists|Ulster]], where industrialisation was more common in contrast to the more agrarian rest of the island. (Any tariff barriers would, it was feared, most heavily hit that region.) In addition, the Protestant population was more strongly located in Ulster, with unionist majorities existing in about four counties.

===Mounting resistance===
Under the leadership of the [[Dublin]]-born [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Sir Edward Carson]] of the [[Irish Unionist Party]] and the northerner [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|Sir James Craig]] of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] unionists became [[Ulster Volunteers|strongly militant]] in order to oppose ''the Coercion of Ulster''. In 1914, to avoid rebellion with Ulster, the British [[Prime Minister]] [[H. H. Asquith]], with agreement of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party#Home Rule succeeds|Irish Party]] leadership, amended a clause into the bill providing for home rule for 26 of the 32 counties, with an as of yet undecided new set of measures to be introduced for the area to be temporarily excluded. Though it received the [[Royal Assent]] and was placed on the statute books, the Third [[Home Rule Act 1914]]'s implementation was suspended until after the [[World War I|Great War]]. (The war at that stage was expected to be ended by 1915, not the four years it did ultimately last.) For the prior reasons of ensuring the implementation of the Act at the end of the war, Redmond and his Irish [[National Volunteers]] supported the [[Allies of World War I|Allied cause]], and 175,000  joined [[Irish regiment]]s of the [[10th (Irish) Division (United Kingdom)|10th (Irish)]], [[16th (Irish) Division (United Kingdom)|16th (Irish)]] and [[36th (Ulster) Division|36th (Ulster)]] divisions of the [[Kitchener's Army|New British Army]].<ref>[http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/index.asp?docID=2517 Department of the Taoiseach] - Irish Soldiers in the First World War</ref>

In January 1919, after the December [[Irish general election, 1918|1918 general election]], 73 of Ireland's 106 [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] elected were [[Sinn Féin]] members who refused to take their seats in the [[British House of Commons]]. Instead, they set up an Irish parliament called [[Dáil Éireann]]. [[First Dáil|This Dáil]] in January 1919 issued a [[Declaration of independence|Declaration of Independence]] and proclaimed an [[Irish Republic]]. The Declaration was mainly a restatement of the [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|1916 Proclamation]] with the additional provision that Ireland was no longer a part of the [[United Kingdom]]. The new Irish Republic was recognised internationally only by the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Republic]]. The Republic's [[Aireacht]] (ministry) sent a delegation under [[Ceann Comhairle]] [[Seán T. O'Kelly]] to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]], but it was not admitted. 

After the bitterly fought [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]], representatives of the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] and the Irish treaty delegates, led by [[Arthur Griffith]], [[Robert Barton]] and [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] negotiated the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] in [[London]] from [[11 October]] &ndash; [[6 December]] [[1921]].  The Irish delegates set up headquarters at [[Hans Place]] in [[Knightsbridge]] and it was here in private discussions that the decision was taken at 11.15am on [[5 December]] to recommend the Treaty to Dáil Éireann.  Under the Treaty the British agreed to the establishment of an independent Irish State whereby the [[Irish Free State]] (in the [[Irish language]] ''Saorstát Éireann'') with [[Dominion|dominion status]] was created. [[Dáil Éireann]] [[Anglo-Irish Treaty Dáil Vote|narrowly ratified]] the treaty.
{{History of Ireland}}
The Treaty was not entirely satisfactory to either side. It gave more concessions to the Irish than the British had intended to give but did not go far enough to satisfy republican aspirations. The new Irish Free State was in theory to cover the entire island, subject to the proviso that six counties in the north-east, termed "[[Northern Ireland]]" (which had been created as one of the two separate Home Rule regions under the ''[[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]'') could opt out and choose to remain part of the United Kingdom, which they duly did. The remaining twenty-six counties (originally "[[Southern Ireland]]" under the Act) became the [[Irish Free State]], a [[constitutional monarchy]] over which the British monarch reigned (from 1927 with the title [[monarchy in the Irish Free State|King of Ireland]]). It had a [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor-General]], a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] parliament, a cabinet called the "[[Executive Council of the Irish Free State|Executive Council]]" and a prime minister called the [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]].

===Permeating partition===
The [[Irish Civil War]] was the direct consequence of the creation of the Irish Free State. Anti-Treaty forces, led by [[Éamon de Valera]], objected to the fact that acceptance of the Treaty ''abolished'' the [[Irish Republic]] of 1919 to which they had sworn loyalty, arguing in the face of public support for the settlement that the "people have no right to do wrong". They objected most to the fact that the state would remain part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] and that [[Teachta Dála|Teachtaí Dála]] would have to swear an oath of fidelity to [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and his successors. Pro-Treaty forces, led by [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], argued that the Treaty gave "not the ultimate freedom that all nations aspire to and develop, but the freedom to achieve it".

At the start of the war, the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) split into two opposing camps: a pro-treaty IRA and an [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|anti-treaty IRA]]. The pro-Treaty IRA became part of the new [[Irish Army]]. However, through the lack of an effective command structure in the anti-Treaty IRA, and their defensive tactics throughout the war, [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Collins]] and his pro-treaty forces were able to build up an army with many tens of thousands of WWI veterans from the 1922 disbanded [[Irish regiment]]s of the British Army, capable of overwhelming the anti-Treatyists. British supplies of artillery, aircraft, machine-guns and ammunition boosted pro-treaty forces, and the threat of a return of Crown forces to the Free State removed any doubts about the necessity of enforcing the treaty. The lack of public support for the anti-treaty forces (often called the ''Irregulars'') and the determination of the government to overcome the Irregulars contributed significantly to their defeat.

The Free State Army suffered 800 fatalities and perhaps as many as 4,000 people were killed altogether.{{Verify credibility|date=March 2008}} The destruction caused by the war caused considerable economic damage to the Free State in the earliest days of its existence, and Northern Ireland's Unionists became hardened in distancing themselves from the Free State.

[[Image:Irishpopulation.png|thumb|400px|Republic of Ireland population during the twentieth century]]

===New Constitution===
On [[29 December]] [[1937]], a new constitution, the [[Constitution of Ireland]], came into force. It replaced the Irish Free State by a new state called simply "Ireland". Though this state's ''constitutional'' structures provided for a [[President of Ireland]] instead of a king, it was not technically a republic; the principal key role possessed by a head of state, that of symbolically representing Ireland internationally remained vested, in ''statute law'', in the King as an ''organ'' of the Irish government. The Irish government had also taken steps to formally abolish the Office of [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor-General]] some months before the new Constitution came into force.<ref>The Governor-General's office was finally abolished under the Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act, 1937 with effect from December 1936</ref>

[[Irish neutrality during World War II|Ireland remained neutral]] during [[World War II]], a period it described as [[The Emergency (Ireland)|The Emergency]]. 

On [[18 April]] [[1949]], the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|Republic of Ireland Act]] came into force. Under that Act, Ireland declared that it was a republic and delegated the functions previously exercised by the King acting on the behalf of the Irish government to the President of Ireland instead.

The Irish state had remained a member of the then-[[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] after independence until the declaration of a republic on [[18 April]] [[1949]]. Under the Commonwealth rules at the time, a declaration of a republic automatically terminated membership of the Commonweatlh. Ireland therefore immediately ceased to be a member and did not subsequently reapply for membership when the Commonwealth later changed its rules to allow republics to join the Commonwealth.

Ireland joined the [[United Nations]] in 1955 and the [[European Community]] (now the [[European Union]]) in 1973. Irish governments have sought the peaceful reunification of Ireland and have usually cooperated with the [[British government]] in the violent conflict involving many [[Paramilitary|paramilitaries]] and the [[British Army]] in Northern Ireland known as "[[The Troubles]]". A peace settlement for Northern Ireland, the [[Belfast Agreement]], was approved in 1998 in referendums north and south of the border. As part of the peace settlement, Ireland dropped its [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland|territorial claim to Northern Ireland]]. The peace settlement is currently being implemented.

==Politics==
[[Image:Mary McAleese.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[President of Ireland]], [[Mary McAleese]]]]
{{main|Politics of the Republic of Ireland}}

Ireland is a [[republic]], with a parliamentary system of government. The [[President of Ireland]], who serves as [[head of state]], is elected for a seven-year term and can be re-elected only once. The president is largely a [[figurehead (metaphor)|figurehead]] but can still carry out certain [[constitution]]al powers and functions, aided by the [[Council of State (Ireland)|Council of State]], an advisory body. The {{lang|ga|''[[Taoiseach]]''}} ([[prime minister]]), is appointed by the president on the nomination of parliament. The {{lang|ga|Taoiseach}} is normally the leader of the political party which wins the most seats in the national elections. It has become normal in the Republic for [[coalition]]s to form a government, and there has not been a single-party government since 1989.

The [[bicameral]] [[parliament]], the {{lang|ga|''[[Oireachtas]]''}}, consists of the President of Ireland, a Senate, {{lang|ga|[[Seanad Éireann]]}}, being the upper House, and a House of Representatives, {{lang|ga|[[Dáil Éireann]]}}, being the lower House.<ref>Article 15.2 of the Constitution of Ireland.</ref> The {{lang|ga|Seanad}} is composed of sixty members; eleven nominated by the {{lang|ga|Taoiseach}}, six elected by two universities, and 43 elected by public representatives from panels of candidates established on a vocational basis. The {{lang|ga|Dáil}} has 166 members, {{lang|ga|''[[Teachta Dála|Teachtaí Dála]]''}}, elected to represent multi-seat [[Parliamentary constituencies in the Republic of Ireland|constituencies]] under the system of [[proportional representation]] by means of the [[Single Transferable Vote]]. Under the constitution, parliamentary elections must be held at least every seven years, though a lower limit may be set by statute law. The current statutory maximum term is five years.

[[Image:Leinsterhouseirl.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leinster House]], the seat of {{lang|ga|''[[Oireachtas Éireann]]''}} (the Irish parliament).]]
The Government is constitutionally limited to fifteen members. No more than two members of the Government can be selected from the Senate, and the {{lang|ga|Taoiseach}}, {{lang|ga|''[[Tánaiste]]''}} (deputy prime minister) and Minister for Finance ''must'' be members of the {{lang|ga|Dáil}}. The current government consists of a coalition of three parties; {{lang|ga|[[Fianna Fáil]]}} under {{lang|ga|Taoiseach}} [[Bertie Ahern]], the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] under new leader [[John Gormley]] and the [[Progressive Democrats]] under [[Minister for Health and Children (Ireland)|Minister for Health and Children]] [[Mary Harney]]. The last scheduled [[Irish general election, 2007|general election]] to the [[Dáil]] took place on [[24 May]] [[2007]], after it was called by the Taoiseach on 29th April.

The main opposition in the current {{lang|ga|Dáil}} consists of [[Fine Gael]] under [[Enda Kenny]], [[Irish Labour Party|The Labour Party]] under [[Eamon Gilmore]] and [[Sinn Féin]]. A number of independent deputies also sit in Dáil Éireann though less in number than before the 2007 election.

Ireland joined the [[European Union]] in 1973 but has chosen to remain outside the [[Schengen Treaty]]. Citizens of the UK can freely enter Ireland without a passport thanks to the [[Common Travel Area]], however some form of identification is required at airports and seaports.

==Counties==
{{main|Counties of Ireland}}
The Republic of Ireland traditionally had twenty-six [[County|counties]], and these are still used in cultural and sporting contexts. [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] constituencies are required by statute to follow county boundaries, as far as possible. Hence counties with greater populations have multiple constituencies (e.g. Limerick East/West) and some constituencies consist of more than one county (e.g. Sligo-North Leitrim), but by and large, the actual county boundaries are not crossed.

As local government units, however, some have been restructured, with the now-abolished [[County Dublin]] distributed among three new county councils in the 1990s and County Tipperary having been administratively two separate counties since the 1890s, giving a present-day total of twenty-nine administrative counties and five cities. The five cities &mdash; Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, and Waterford (Kilkenny is a city but does not possess a city council) &mdash; are administered separately from the remainder of their respective counties. Five boroughs &mdash; Clonmel, Drogheda, Kilkenny, Sligo and Wexford &mdash; have a level of autonomy within the county:

{{main|Geography of Ireland|Geography of the Republic of Ireland}}

The island of Ireland extends over 84,421 [[Square kilometre]]s (32,556 [[square mile]]s), of which 83% (approx. five-sixths) belong to the Republic (70,280 km²; 27,103&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and the remainder constituting Northern Ireland. It is bound to the west by the [[Atlantic Ocean]], to the northeast by the [[North Channel (Great Britain and Ireland)|North Channel]]. To the east is found the [[Irish Sea]] which reconnects to the ocean via the southwest with [[St George's Channel]] and the [[Celtic Sea]]. The west-coast of Ireland mostly consists of cliffs, hills and low mountains (the highest point being [[Carrauntoohil]] at 1,038 [[Metre|m]] or 3,406 [[Foot (unit of length)|ft]]). The interior of the country is relatively flat land, traversed by rivers such as the [[River Shannon]] and several large lakes or ''loughs''. The centre of the country is part of the River Shannon watershed, containing large areas of [[bogland]], used for [[peat]] extraction and production.

The local [[temperate climate]] is modified by the [[North Atlantic Current]] and is relatively mild. Summer temperatures exceed 30 °[[Celsius|C]] (86 °F) usually once every decade, though commonly reach 29 °C (84 °[[Fahrenheit|F]]) most summers, and freezes occur only occasionally in winter, with temperatures below -6 °C (21 °F) being uncommon. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is very common, with some parts of the country getting up to 275 days with rain annually. 

Chief city conurbations are the capital [[Dublin]] 1,045,769 on the east coast, [[Cork (city)|Cork]] 190,384 in the south, [[Limerick City|Limerick]] 90,757 in the mid-west, [[Galway]] 72,729 on the west coast, and [[Waterford City|Waterford]] 49,213 on the south east coast (see [[Cities in Ireland]]).

====Impact of agriculture====
The long history of agricultural production coupled with modern intensive agricultural methods (such as pesticide and fertiliser use) has placed pressure on biodiversity in Ireland. Agriculture is the main factor determining current land use patterns in Ireland, leaving limited land to preserve natural habitats (also forestry and urban development to a lesser extent),<ref name="land_cover">{{Citation

  | publisher = Environmental Protection Agency
  | year = 2000
  | url=http://www.epa.ie/whatwedo/assessment/land/
  | accessdate = 2007-07-30}}</ref> in particular for larger wild mammals with greater territorial requirements. With no top predator in Ireland, populations of animals that cannot be controlled by smaller predators (such as the fox) are controlled by annual culling, i.e. semi-wild populations of deer. A land of green fields for crop cultivation and cattle rearing limits the space available for the establishment of native wild species. Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. Their ecosystems stretch across the countryside and act as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. 

Pollution from agricultural activities is one of the principal sources of environmental damage. "Runoff" of contaminants into streams, rivers and lakes impact the natural fresh-water ecosystems.<ref name="water_contamination">{{Citation

</ref> The CAP still subsidises some potentially destructive agricultural practices, however, the recent reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.<ref name="cap_reforms"/> 

Forest covers about 10% of the country, with most designated for commercial production.<ref name="land_cover"/> Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting a broad range of native species of invertebrates. Remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the country, in particular in the [[Killarney National Park]]. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. This is one of the main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country.<ref>{{Citation

==Education==
{{seealso|Education in the Republic of Ireland}}
The education systems are largely under the direction of the government via the [[Minister for Education and Science (Ireland)|Minister for Education and Science]] (currently [[Mary Hanafin]], TD). Recognised primary and secondary schools must adhere to the curriculum established by authorities that have power to set them.

The education systems in Ireland are complex due to a confusion of ownership, control and curricular assessment. This has arisen because the systems developed over long periods of time with variable influence by several key players, including the Irish state.{{Verify credibility|date=March 2008}} Unlike in countries such as France, Ireland's state education system is largely limited to the content of the curriculum, although this too is mediated by voluntary interests.{{Verify credibility|date=March 2008}} The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]], coordinated by the [[OECD]], currently ranks Ireland's education as the 20th best in the world, being significantly higher than the OECD average.<ref>http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/8/39700724.pdf</ref>

Primary, Secondary and Tertiary (University/College) level education are all free in Ireland for all [[EU]] citizens.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of the Republic of Ireland}}
[[Image:Ireland income distribution chart.gif|thumb|Disposable income per person as a percentage of the national average.]] 
The economy of Ireland has transformed in recent years from an agricultural focus to a modern, [[knowledge economy]], focusing on services and high-tech industries and dependent on trade, industry and investment. Economic growth in Ireland averaged a (relatively high) 10% from 1995–2000, and 7% from 2001–2004. [[Industry]], which accounts for 46% of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]], about 80% of exports, and 29% of the labour force, now takes the place of [[agriculture]] as the country's leading sector. 

Exports play a fundamental role in Ireland's growth, but the economy also benefits from the accompanying rise in consumer spending, construction, and business investment. On paper, the country is the largest exporter of software-related goods and services in the world.{{Verify credibility|date=March 2008}} In fact, a lot of foreign software, and sometimes music, is filtered through the country to avail of Ireland's non-taxing of royalties from copyrighted goods.

A key part of economic policy, since 1987, has been [[Social Partnership]] which is a [[corporatism|neo-corporatist]] set of voluntary 'pay pacts' between the Government, employers and trades unions. These usually set agreed pay rises for three-year periods.

Ireland joined in launching the [[Euro]] currency system in January 1999 (leaving behind the [[Irish pound]]) along with eleven other EU nations. The 1995 to 2000 period of high economic growth led many to call the country the [[Celtic Tiger]]. The economy felt the impact of the global economic slowdown in 2001, particularly in the high-tech export sector — the growth rate in that area was cut by nearly half. GDP growth continued to be relatively robust, with a rate of about 6% in 2001 and 2002. Growth for 2004 was over 4%, and for 2005 was 4.7%.

With high growth came high levels of inflation, particularly in the capital city. Prices in [[Dublin]], where nearly 30% of Ireland's population lives, are considerably higher than elsewhere in the country,<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.finfacts.com/Private/bestprice/irishconsumerprices.pdf Consumer Prices Bi-annual Average Price Analysis Dublin and Outside Dublin:  1 May 2006]|170&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 174411 bytes -->}} - CSO</ref> especially in the [[Irish Property Bubble|property market]].

Measuring Ireland's level of income per capita is a complicated issue. Ireland possesses the second highest [[GDP]] ([[Purchasing power parity|PPP]]) per capita in the world (US$43,600 as of 2006), behind [[Luxembourg]], and the fifth highest [[Human Development Index]], which is calculated partially on the basis of GDP per capita. However, many economists feel that GDP per capita is an inappropriate measure of national income for Ireland, as it neglects the fact that much income generated in Ireland belongs to multinational companies and eventually goes offshore <ref> Forfas National Comoetitiveness Report, 2006, Fig 2.02 http://www.forfas.ie/ncc/reports/ncc_annual_06/ch02/ch02_01.html#fn2</ref>. Another measure, Gross National Income per head, takes account of this and therefore many economists feel it is a superior measure of income in the country. In 2005, the [[World Bank]] measured Ireland's GNI per head at $41,140 - the seventh highest in the world, sixth highest in [[Western Europe]], and the third highest of any [[EU]] member state. Also, a study by ''The Economist'' found  Ireland to have the best [[quality of life]] in the world.<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/QUALITY_OF_LIFE.pdf The Economist Intelligence Unit’s quality-of-life index]|67.1&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 68805 bytes -->}} - The Economist</ref> This study employed GDP per capita as a measure of income rather than GNI per capita. 

The positive reports and economic statistics mask several underlying imbalances. The construction sector, which is inherently cyclical in nature, now accounts for a significant component of Ireland's GDP. A recent downturn in residential property market sentiment has highlighted the over-exposure of the Irish economy to construction, which now presents a threat to economic growth.<ref name="oecd_survey">{{Citation

However, after a construction boom in the last decade, economic growth is now slowing. Bank of Ireland predicts economic growth of 3% this year which is down from 4.8% in 2007, this will still be higher than most EU countries. Ireland now has the second-highest level of household debt in the world, at 190% of household income.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2008/03/11/cnirish111.xml |title=Irish banks may need life-support as property prices crash |author=Ambrose Evans-Pritchard |work=The [[Daily Telegraph]] |date=[[13 March]] [[2008]] |accessdate=2008-03-13}}</ref>

==Military==
{{main|Irish Defence Forces}}

Ireland's armed forces are organised under the [[Irish Defence Forces]] ({{lang|ga|''[[Óglaigh na hÉireann]]''}}). The [[Irish Army]] is relatively small compared to other neighbouring armies in the region, but is well equipped, with 8,500 full-time military personnel (13,000 in the reserve army).<ref>[http://www.military.ie/army/intro.htm Irish Defence Forces, Army (accessed 15 June 2006)]</ref> This is principally due to Ireland's policy of [[neutral country|neutrality]],<ref> See Gilland, Karin.

There is also an [[Irish Air Corps]] and [[Reserve Defence Forces]] ([[Irish Army Reserve]] and [[Naval Service Reserve]]) under the Defence Forces. The [[Irish Army Rangers]] is a special forces branch which operates under the aegis of the army.

Over 40,000 Irish servicemen have served in UN peacekeeping missions around the world.

The Republic's air facilities were used by the U.S. military, for the delivery of military personnel involved in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] through [[Shannon Airport]]; previously the airport had been used for the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invasion of Afghanistan]] in 2001. This is part of a longer history of use of Shannon for controversial military transport, which is largely unbiased towards any particular military alliance. The airport was used previously by the US in the [[First Gulf War]] and by the Soviet Union during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Kennedy | first = Michael | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Ireland's Role in Post-War Transatlantic Aviation and Its Implications for the Defence of the North Atlantic Area | publisher = Royal Irish Academy | date=  204-10-08 | url = http://www.histech.nl/Shot2004/programma/txt/kennedy.asp?file=kennedy | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2007-10-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Private Members' Business. - Foreign Conflicts: Motion (Resumed) | work = | publisher = Government of Ireland | date=  2003-01-30 | url = http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0560/D.0560.200301300005.html | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2007-10-10 }} - [[Tony Gregory]] speaking in [[Dáil Éireann]]</ref>

{{main|Demographics of the Republic of Ireland}}

Genetic research suggests that the first settlers of Ireland, and parts of North-Western Europe, came through migrations from [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]] following the end of the most recent [[ice age]].<ref>[http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=7817 Myths of British ancestry] - Prospect Magazine</ref> After the [[Mesolithic]], the [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] migrants introduced [[Celt]]ic culture and languages to Ireland.<ref>[http://www.breakingnews.ie/2004/09/09/story165780.html [[Geneticist]]s find Celtic links to Spain and Portugal] - breakingnews.ie</ref> These later migrants from the Neolithic to Bronze Age still represent a minority of the genetic heritage of Irish people. ("Origins of the British", Stephen Oppenheimer, 2006)<ref>[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=15309688 The Longue Durée of Genetic Ancestry: Multiple Genetic Marker Systems and Celtic Origins on the Atlantic Facade of Europe] - PUBMED</ref> Culture spread throughout the island, and the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] tradition became the dominant form in Ireland. Today, Irish people are mainly of [[Gaels|Gaelic]] ancestry, and although some of the population is also of Norse, Anglo-Norman, English, Scottish, French and Welsh ancestry, these groups have been assimilated and do not form distinct [[minority group]]s. Gaelic culture and language forms an important part of national identity. In the UK, [[Irish Traveller]]s are a recognised ethnic [[minority group]], politically (but not ethnically) linked with mainland European Roma and Gypsy groups,<ref>[http://www.cre.gov.uk/gdpract/g_and_t_facts.html ''Commission for Racial Equality:'' Gypsies and Irish Travellers: The facts]</ref> although in Ireland, they are not, instead they are classified as a "social group".<ref>[http://www.itmtrav.com/Legal-ResourcePack2.html ''Irish Travellers Movement:'' Traveller Legal Resource Pack 2 - Traveller Culture]</ref>

Ireland, as of 2007, contains the fastest growing population in [[Europe]]. The growth rate in 2006 was 2.5%, the third year in a row it has been above 2%. This rapid growth can be said to be due to falling death rates, rising birth rates and high immigration rates. <ref>[http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/mheykfauqlmh/ BreakingNews.ie - ''Ireland's population still fastest-growing in EU'']</ref>

=== Languages ===
{{main|Languages of Ireland|Irish language|Hiberno-English}}
The official languages are [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[English language|English]]. Teaching of the Irish and English languages is compulsory in the primary and secondary level schools that receive money and recognition from the state. Some students may be exempt from the requirement to receive instruction in either language. English is by far the predominant language spoken throughout the country. People living in predominantly Irish-speaking communities, [[Gaeltacht]] regions, are limited to the low tens of thousands in isolated pockets largely on the western seaboard. Road signs are usually bilingual, except in Gaeltacht regions, where they are in Irish only. The legal status of place names has recently been the subject of controversy, with an order made in 2005 under the [[Official Languages Act 2003|Official Languages Act]] changing the official name of certain locations from English back to Irish (e.g. [[Dingle]] had its name changed to ''An Daingean'' despite local opposition and a local plebiscite requesting that the name be changed to a bilingual version: ''Dingle Daingean Ui Chuis''. Most public notices are only in [[English language|English]], as are most of the print media. Most Government publications and forms are available in both English and Irish, and citizens have the right to deal with the state in Irish if they so wish.  National media in Irish exist on TV ([[TG4]]), radio (e.g. [[Raidió na Gaeltachta]]), and in print (e.g. [[Lá Nua]] and [[Foinse]]).

According to the 2006 census, 1,656,790 people (or 39%) in the Republic regard themselves as competent in Irish; though no figures are available for English-speakers, it is thought to be almost 100%.

The [[Polish language]] is one of the most widely-spoken languages in Ireland after English and Irish: there are over 63,000 Poles resident in Ireland according to the 2006 census. Other languages spoken in Ireland include [[Shelta]], spoken by the [[Irish Traveller]] population and  a dialect of [[Ulster Scots language|Scots]] is spoken by the descendents of [[Ulster-Scots|Scottish settlers]] in [[Ulster]]. {{Unicode|}}

Most students at second level choose one or two foreign [[languages]] to learn. Languages available for the [[Junior Certificate]] and the [[Leaving Certificate]] include [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; Leaving Certificate students can also study [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Some schools also offer [[Ancient Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew Studies]] and [[Latin]] at second level.

===Recent population growth===
Ireland's population has increased greatly in recent years.  Much of this population growth can be attributed to the arrival of immigrants and the return of Irish people (often with their foreign-born children) who emigrated in large numbers in earlier years during periods of high unemployment. However, birth rates in Ireland are currently over double the death rates, which is highly unusual among Western European countries, and the nation seems to be in the midst of a baby boom.<ref>[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/boom-in-births-as-new-arrivals-double-on-death-rates-1048773.html Irish Independent - Boom in births as new arrivals double on death rates]</ref> Approximately 10% of Ireland's population is now made up of foreign citizens.
[[Image:NonnationalsIreland2006.png|thumb|300px|left|Non-national groups with populations in Ireland of 10,000 or more in 2006. Non-European Union nationals are shown exploded.]]
The [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|CSO]] has published preliminary findings based on the 2006 Census of Population. These indicate:
* The total population of Ireland on Census Day, [[April 23]] [[2006]], was 4,234,925, an increase of 317,722, or 8.1% since 2002
*Allowing for the incidence of births (245,000) and deaths (114,000), the derived net immigration of people to Ireland between 2002 and 2006 was 186,000. 
*The total number of non-nationals (foreign citizens) resident in Ireland is 419,733, or around 10% (plus 1,318 people with 'no nationality' and 44,279 people whose nationality is not stated).
*The single largest group of immigrants comes from the [[United Kingdom]] (112,548) followed by [[Poland]] (63,267), [[Lithuania]] (24,628), [[Nigeria]] (16,300), [[Latvia]] (13,319), the [[United States]] (12,475), [[China]] (11,161), and [[Germany]] (10,289).
*94.8% of the population was recorded as having a 'White' ethnic or cultural background.  1.1% of the population had a 'Black or Black Irish' background, 1.3% had an 'Asian or Asian Irish' background and 1.7% of the population's ethnic or cultural background was 'not stated'.
*The average annual rate of increase, 2%, is the highest on record – compared to 1.3% between 1996 and 2002 and 1.5% between 1971 and 1979.
*The 2006 population was last exceeded in the 1861 Census when the population then was 4.4 million The lowest population of Ireland was recorded in the 1961 Census – 2.8 million.
*All provinces of Ireland recorded population growth. The population of [[Leinster]] grew by 8.9%; [[Munster]] by 6.5%; and the long-term population decline of the [[Connacht]]-[[Ulster]]<ref>Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan only.  Remaining Ulster counties are in Northern Ireland</ref> Region has stopped.
* The ratio of males to females has declined in each of the four provinces between 1979 and 2006. Leinster is the only province where the number of females exceeds the number of males. Males predominate in rural counties such as [[Cavan]], [[County Leitrim|Leitrim]], and [[Roscommon]] while there are more females in cities and urban areas.

A more detailed breakdown of these figures is available online. {{PDFlink|[http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Final%20Principal%20Demographic%20Results%202006.pdf Census 2006 Principal Demographic Results]|894&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 916355 bytes -->}}

==Religion==
[[Image:Relig-ire-2006.PNG|thumb|A pie chart showing the proportion of followers of each religion (and none) in Ireland in 2006.]]
[[Image:Stpatrickcathedral dublin.jpg|thumb|upright|St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, the National Cathedral of the [[Church of Ireland]] (part of the [[Anglican Communion]]).]]

Ireland has an explicitly Christian constitution but the state is forbidden from endowing any particular religion. Approximately 86.8% of the population are [[Roman Catholic]],<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Final%20Principal%20Demographic%20Results%202006.pdf Final Principal Demographic Results 2006]|894&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 916355 bytes -->}}</ref> and the country has one of the highest rates of regular and weekly church attendance in the [[Western World]].<ref>[http://cara.georgetown.edu/bulletin/international.htm Weekly Mass Attendance of Catholics in Nations with Large Catholic Populations, 1980-2000] - World Values Survey (WVS)</ref> However, there has been a major decline in this attendance among [[Irish Catholic]]s in the course of the past 30 years. Between 1996 and 2001, regular [[Roman Catholic Mass|Mass]] attendance, declined further from 60% to 48%<ref>[http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=44521 Irish Mass attendance below 50%] - Catholic World News [[June 1]], [[2006]]</ref> (it had been above 90% before 1973), and all but two of its sacerdotal seminaries have closed (St Patrick's College, Maynooth and St Malachy's College, Belfast). A number of theological colleges continue to educate both ordained and lay people. 

The second largest Christian denomination, the [[Church of Ireland]] ([[Anglicanism|Anglican]]), having been declining in number for most of the twentieth century, but has more recently experienced an increase in membership, according to the 2002 census, as have other small Christian denominations, and [[Hinduism in Ireland|Hinduism]].  The largest other Protestant denominations are the [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland]], followed by the [[Methodist Church in Ireland]]. The very small [[Judaism|Jewish]] community in Ireland also recorded a marginal increase (see [[History of the Jews in Ireland]]) in the same period.

The patron saints of Ireland are [[Saint Patrick]] and [[Brigid of Kildare|Saint Bridget]].

According to the 2006 census, the number of people who described themselves as having "no religion" was 186,318 (4.4%). An additional 1,515 people described themselves as agnostic and 929 as atheist instead of ticking the "no religion" box. This brings the total nonreligious within the state to 4.5% of the population. A further 70,322 (1.7%) did not state a religion.<ref>[http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Final%20Principal%20Demographic%20Results%202006.pdf Final Principal Demographic Results 2006]</ref>

===Religion and politics===
The 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]] gave the [[Catholic Church]] a "special position" as the church of the majority, but also recognised other Christian denominations and Judaism.  As with other predominantly Catholic European states (e.g., [[Italy]]), the Irish state underwent a period of legal secularisation in the late [[20th century|twentieth century]].  In 1972, the article of the Constitution naming specific religious groups, including the Catholic Church was deleted by the [[Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]].

Article 44 remains in the Constitution. It begins:
:''The State acknowledges that the homage of public worship is due to Almighty God. It shall hold His Name in reverence, and shall respect and honour religion.''
The article also establishes freedom of religion (for belief, practice, and organisation without undue interference from the state), prohibits endowment of any particular religion, prohibits the state from religious discrimination, and requires the state to treat religious and non-religious schools in a non-prejudicial manner.

Catholic doctrine prohibits [[abortion]] in all circumstances, putting it in conflict with the [[pro-choice]] movement.  In 1983, the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]] recognised "the right to life of the unborn", subject to qualifications concerning the "equal right to life" of the mother.  The case of ''[[Attorney General v. X]]'' prompted passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Thirteenth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Fourteenth]] Amendments, guaranteeing the right to travel abroad to have an abortion performed, and the right of citizens to learn about "services" that are illegal in Ireland but legal outside the country (see [[Abortion in Ireland]]).

Catholic and Protestant attitudes in 1937 also disapproved of divorce, which was prohibited by the original Constitution.  It was not until 1995 that the [[Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Fifteenth Amendment]] repealed this ban.

The [[Catholic Church]] was hit in the 1990s by a series of sexual abuse scandals and cover-up charges against its hierarchy. In 2005, a major inquiry was made into [[child sexual abuse]] allegations. The Ferns report, published on [[25 October]], [[2005]], revealed that more than 100 cases of child sexual abuse, between 1962 and 2002, by 21 priests, had taken place in the Diocese of Ferns alone. The report criticised the [[Garda Síochána|Gardaí]] and the health authorities, who failed to protect the children to the best of their abilities; and in the case of the Garda before 1988, no file was ever recorded on sexual abuse complaints (see [[Roman Catholic sex abuse cases]]).

Despite most schools in Ireland being run by religious organisations, a general trend of secularism is occurring within the Irish population, particularly in the younger generations.<ref>Among many examples:<br/>John Daniszewski, April 17, 2005, [http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-ireland17apr17,0,5254747.story Catholicism Losing Ground in Ireland], LA Times<br/>[http://www.secularism.org.uk/irishpollshowsparentsnolongerwan.html Irish poll shows parents no longer want to force religion on to children] from secularism.org.uk<br/>Phil Lawler, 17 September 2007, [http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=53564 Ireland threatened by secularism, Pope tells new envoy], Catholic World News</ref> Many efforts have been made by secular groups, to eliminate the rigorous study in the first and sixth classes, to prepare for the sacraments of [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]] and [[confirmation]]. However religious studies as a subject was introduced into the state administered "Junior certificate" in 2001.

In the past, Ireland has historically favoured conservative legislation regarding sexuality. For example, contraception was illegal in Ireland until 1979.<ref name="familyplanning">{{cite web | title = Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979 | date=  1979-07-23 | publisher = Office of the Attorney General | url = http://193.178.1.79:80/1979/en/act/pub/0020/index.html | accessdate = 2007-06-07}}</ref> Another example is the legislation which outlawed homosexual acts was not repealed until 1993 although it was generally only enforced when dealing with underage sex.<ref name="norris">{{cite web | title = NORRIS v.

The national airline is [[Aer Lingus]], although low cost airline [[Ryanair]] is the largest airline. The route between [[London]] and [[Dublin]] is the busiest international air route in Europe, with 4.5 million people flying between the two cities in 2006.<ref>Seán McCárthaigh, [http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2003/03/31/story437213650.asp Dublin–London busiest air traffic route within EU], ''Irish Examiner'', [[March 31]], [[2003]]</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Heathrow dominates top 20 | author = Mark Frary | url = http://travel.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/travel/business/article1538856.ece | publisher = ''[[The Times]]'' | date = [[19 March]] [[2007]] | accessdate = 2007-07-04}}</ref>

Railways services are provided by [[Iarnród Éireann]]. Dublin is the centre of the network, with two main stations ([[Dublin Heuston railway station|Heuston]] and [[Dublin Connolly railway station|Connolly]]) linking to the main towns and cities. The [[Enterprise (train)|Enterprise]] service, run jointly with [[Northern Ireland Railways]] connects Dublin with Belfast. Dublin has a steadily improving public transport network of varying quality including the DART, LUAS, Bus service and an expanding rail network.

The [[motorway]]s and major [[trunk roads]] are managed by the [[National Roads Authority]]. The rest of the road network is managed by the local authorities in each of their areas.
