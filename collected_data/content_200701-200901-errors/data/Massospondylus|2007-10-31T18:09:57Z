'''''Massospondylus''''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], meaning "elongated vertebra"), was a [[genus]] of [[prosauropod]] [[dinosaur]] from the Early [[Jurassic]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] and possibly the Late [[Triassic]]. It was probably a plant eater ([[herbivore]]), although it is speculated that the prosauropods may have been [[Omnivore|omnivorous]]. ''Massospondylus'' was described by Sir [[Richard Owen]] in 1854 from remains found in [[South Africa]]. It is thus one of the first dinosaurs to have been named. Fossils have since been found in [[Arizona]]'s [[Kayenta Formation]], South Africa and [[Zimbabwe]]. 

The [[type species|type]], and only universally recognized species, is ''M. carinatus'', although many other species have been named in the past 150 years. The family name Massospondylidae was once erected for the genus, but it is not clear which dinosaurs, if any, belong in a natural grouping of massospondylids.

Long depicted as bipedal, a recent study indicates ''Massospondylus'' was a quadruped. The animal had a long neck and tail with a small head and slender body. It bore a sharp thumb claw on each of its forefeet, used in defense or feeding.

==Description==
[[Image:Massospondylus.jpg|350px|thumb|left]]
''Massospondylus'' was a mid-sized [[prosauropod]] at 6.1&nbsp;meters (20&nbsp;ft) long, about 1.5&nbsp;meters (5&nbsp;ft) tall and had a 2.4&nbsp;meter (8&nbsp;ft) long tail. Although long assumed to have been [[quadruped|quadrupedal]], a recent anatomical study of the forelimbs has questioned this, arguing that their range and motion precludes effective habitual quadrupedal gait.<ref name ="Bon07">Bonnan M, Senter P. (2007). "Were the basal sauropodomorph dinosaurs ''Plateosaurus'' and ''Massospondylus'' habitual quadrupeds?"; pp. 139-155 in Barrett, P.M. and Batten, D.J. (eds.), ''Evolution and Palaeobiology of Early Sauropodomorph Dinosaurs''. ''Special Papers in Palaeontology'' '''77'''. </ref> The animal was a typical prosauropod in most other respects. It possessed a slender body and long neck; it had a slighter build than that of ''[[Plateosaurus]]''. Like ''Plateosaurus'', however, it had five digits on each foot, with a large thumb claw used for feeding or defense against predators. The fourth and fifth digits of the forepaws were tiny, giving the forepaws a lopsided look.

The small head of ''Massospondylus'' was approximately half the length of the [[femur]]. The skull bore two almost circular eye sockets. Based on the presence of holes for blood vessels near the coronoid eminence, it has been proposed that ''Massospondylus'' had cheeks. The jaw was slightly more primitive than that of ''Plateosaurus''. Teeth in the lower jaw were not as long as those in the upper jaw. There also seems to be some variation of tooth morphology, based upon the tooth's position in the jaw, although this is not as pronounced as the specialization of teeth in ''[[Heterodontosaurus]]''. Teeth occupying a position closer to the front of the snout were rounder than the more oval-shaped back teeth. ''Massospondylus'' is occasionally depicted with a beak, but this is not consistent with presence of teeth in the front of the lower jaw. Interestingly, the skull of the Arizona specimen is 25% larger than the largest skull from any African specimen.

==Discovery and species==
The first [[skeleton]] of ''Massospondylus'' was described by [[paleontology|paleontologist]] Sir [[Richard Owen]] in 1854.<ref>Owen, R. (1854). "Descriptive catalogue of the Fossil organic remains of Reptilia and Pisces contained in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England." London p. 1-184</ref>  ''Massospondylus'' remains have been found in [[South Africa]], [[Zimbabwe]], and the [[Kayenta Formation]] of [[Arizona]].

Many species have been named, although most are no longer considered valid. ''M. carinatus'', named by Richard Owen, is the [[type species]].

A number of dinosaurs are usually considered synonymous with ''Massospondylus''. These include ''Aristosaurus'', ''Dromicosaurus'', ''Gryponyx'', ''Hortalotarsus'', and ''Pachyspondylus''. Under the rules of zoological nomenclature, these names are [[synonym (taxonomy)|junior synonym]]s. They were named after ''Massospondylus'' was described in a scientific paper; thus the name ''Massospondylus'' takes priority.

==Classification==
''Massospondylus'' is a [[prosauropoda|prosauropod]], a [[cladistics|clade]] or grouping of early [[saurischia]]n dinosaurs which lived during the Triassic and Jurassic, but which had died out by the end of the Jurassic. Other members of the clade may include ''[[Plateosaurus]]'',<ref name="Dinosauria">Galton, P.M. and Upchurch, P. (2004). "Prosauropoda". In Weishampel, D.B., Dodson, P., and Osmólska, H. (eds.), ''The Dinosauria'' (second edition).

(eds.), ''Thunder-Lizards: The Sauropodomorph Dinosaurs''. Indiana University Press, Bloomington. 1-37</ref> Basal sauropodomorph systematics continue to undergo revision, and many genera once considered classic prosauropods have recently been removed from the group. Exactly which animals constitute a [[monophyly|monophyletic]] (natural grouping) of prosauropods is unclear. Galton and Upchurch (2004) included ''[[Ammosaurus]]'', ''[[Anchisaurus]]'', ''[[Azendohsaurus]]'', ''[[Camelotia]]'', ''[[Coloradisaurus]]'', ''[[Euskelosaurus]]'', ''[[Jingshanosaurus]]'', ''[[Lessemsaurus]]'', ''[[Lufengosaurus]]'', ''Massospondylus'', ''[[Melanorosaurus]]'', ''[[Mussaurus]]'', ''Plateosaurus'', ''[[Riojasaurus]]'', ''[[Ruehleia]]'', ''[[Saturnalia (dinosaur)|Saturnalia]]'', ''[[Sellosaurus]]'', ''[[Thecodontosaurus]]'', ''[[Yimenosaurus]]'' and  ''[[Yunnanosaurus]]'' in a monophyletic Prosauropoda.<ref name="Dinosauria"/> Wilson (2005) considered ''Massospondylus'', ''Jingshanosaurus'', ''Plateosaurus'', and ''Lufengosaurus'' a natural group.<ref name="Wilson">{{cite book| last =Wilson| first =Jeffrey A.| authorlink =| coauthors =Curry Rogers, Kristina| title = The Sauropods: Evolution and Paleobiology| publisher =University of California Press| date =2005| location =| pages =15-49| url =| doi =| id =  | isbn =978-0-520-24623-2 }}</ref>

''Massospondylus'' is the [[type genus]] of the proposed family [[Massospondylidae]], to which it gives its name. The Massospondylidae family may also include ''[[Ammosaurus]]'' although Galton and Upchurch (2004) classified ''Ammosaurus'' as belonging to the Anchisauridae.<ref name="Dinosauria"/>

==Paleobiology==
As with all dinosaurs, much of the biology of ''Massospondylus'', including its behavior, coloration, ecology, and physiology, remains unknown. However, recent studies have allowed for some informed speculation on subjects such as growth patterns, diet, posture, biomechanics, and reproduction.

A 2005 study indicated that ''Massospondylus''' sister taxon ''Plateosaurus'' exhibited growth patterns affected by environmental factors. The study indicated that when food was plentiful, or when the climate was favorable, ''Plateosaurus'' exhibited accelerated growth. This pattern of growth is called developmental plasticity. It is not seen in other dinosaurs, including ''Massospondylus'', despite the close relationship between ''Plateosaurus'' and ''Massospondylus''. The study indicated that ''Massospondylus'' grew along a specific growth trajectory with little variation in the growth rate and ultimate size of an individual.<ref name="Sanderklein">{{cite journal| last =Sander| first =P. Martin| authorlink =| coauthors =Klein, Nicole| title =Developmental plasticity in the life history of a prosauropod dinosaur| journal =Science| volume =310| issue =| pages =1800-1802| publisher =| location =| date =2005| url =| doi =10.1126/science.1120125| id =| accessdate =2007-10-26}}</ref>

===Diet===
Prosauropods such as ''Massospondylus'' may have been either [[herbivore|herbivorous]] or possibly [[omnivore|omnivorous]]. [[Gastrolith]]s (gizzard stones) have been found in association with ''Massospondylus'' fossils,<ref name="Weemsetal">{{cite journal| last =Weems| first =Robert E.| authorlink =| coauthors =Culp, Michelle J. and Wings, Oliver| title =Evidence for Prosauropod Dinosaur Gastroliths in the Bull Run Formation (Upper Triassic, Norian) of Virginia| journal =Ichnos| volume =13| issue =3-4| pages =271-295| publisher =| location =| date =2007| url =| doi =10.1080/10420940601050030| id =| accessdate =2007-10-27}}</ref> indicating ''Massospondylus'' swallowed stones to aid in digestion.

===Reproduction===
In the [[1970s]], six 190-million year old ''Massospondylus'' eggs were found, in [[Golden Gate Highlands National Park]] in [[South Africa]] by [[James Kitching]], who identified them as belonging most likely to ''Massospondylus''. It took nearly 30 years before extraction was started on the fossils of the 15&nbsp;[[centimetre]] (6&nbsp;in) long embryos. They remain the oldest dinosaur embryos ever found. Notably, the near-hatchlings had no teeth, suggesting they had no way of feeding themselves. Scientists speculate that after-birth care might have been necessary based on the body proportions and the lack of teeth. The four legs of the near-hatchlings were of equal length, indicating that newly-hatched ''Massospondylus'' were quadrupedal. The skull and eye were proportionately over-sized. This suggests a different pattern of development for dinosaurs from that which had previously been thought.<ref name="Reiszetal05">{{cite journal| last =Reisz| first =Robert R.| authorlink =| coauthors =Scott, Diane; Sues, Hans-Dieter; Evans, David C. and Raath, Michael A.| title =Embryos of an Early Jurassic prosauropod dinosaur and their evolutionary significance| journal =Science| volume =309| issue =| pages =761-764| publisher =| location =| date =2005| url =| doi =10.1126/science.1114942| id =| accessdate =2007-10-24}}</ref>

===Respiratory system===
Many [[saurischia]]n dinosaurs possessed vertebrae and ribs which contained hollowed-out cavities (pneumatic [[Foramen|foramina]]) which reduced the weight of the bones and may have served as a basic 'flow-through ventilation' system similar to that of modern birds. In avians, the neck vertebrae and ribs are hollowed out by the cervical air sac, the upper back vertebrae by the [[lung]], and the lower back and [[sacrum|sacral]] (hip) vertebrae by the abdominal air sac. This complex method of respiration is very efficient.<ref name=oconnorclaessens2006>{{cite_journal |last=O'Connor |first=Patrick M. |coauthors=& Claessens, Leon P.A.M. |year=2006 |title=Basic avian pulmonary design and flow-through ventilation in non-avian theropod dinosaurs |journal=Nature |volume=436 |issue=7048 |pages=253–256 |doi=10.1038/nature03716}}</ref> Prosauropods were unusual as the only major group of saurischians which lacked an extensive system of pneumatic foramina. Although possible pneumatic indentations have been found in ''Plateosaurus'' and ''Thecodontosaurus'', these hollows were very small. One study in 2007 concluded that it was likely that prosauropods like ''Massospondylus'' had abdominal and cervical air sacs because of the good evidence for them in sister taxa (theropods and sauropods). The study concluded that it was not possible to determine whether prosauropods had a bird-like flow-through lung, but that the air sacs were almost certainly present.<ref name="Wedel">{{cite journal| last =Wedel| first =Mathew| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =What pneumaticity tells us about 'prosauropods', and vice versa| journal =Special Papers in Palaeontology| volume =77| issue =| pages =207-222| publisher =| location =| date =2007| url =http://sauroposeidon.net/Wedel_2007_pneumaticity-and-prosauropods.pdf| doi =| id =| accessdate =2007-10-31}}</ref>
