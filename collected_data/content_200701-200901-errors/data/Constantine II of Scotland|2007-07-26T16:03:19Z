'''Causantín mac Áeda''' ([[anglicised]] '''Constantine II''') (before 879 &ndash; [[952]]) was king of [[Kingdom of Alba|Alba]] from [[900]] to [[943]]. He was the son of [[Áed of Scotland|Áed mac Cináeda]] and first cousin of the previous ruler, [[Donald II of Scotland|Domnall mac Causantín]]. Causantín mac Áeda's reign is the second longest before the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, exceeded only by [[William I of Scotland|William the Lion]].

==Early Period: the Viking threat==
[[Image:Image Constantine II map.png|thumb|right|180px|Northern Britain circa 900.]]
Prior to his reign, Scotland had been dominated by, and perhaps tributary to, the [[Viking]] kings of the Irish Sea province in the later 9th century. During his reign, Causantín faced [[Viking]] raids from the north and west, and expanding [[Anglo-Saxon monarchs|Anglo-Saxon kings]] of [[Wessex]], while establishing the kingdom of Alba in its definitive [[Gaels|Gaelicised]] form.

The Chronicle of the Kings of Alba records an attack by the Vikings, and the plundering of Dunkeld, in the third year of Causantín's reign. The following year, the invaders were defeated in Strathearn.<ref>CKA. Regarding Strathearn, there are two such in Scotland: a southerly area, around [[Loch Earn]], and a northerly one, near [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]] in [[Fortriu]]. Arguments can be made for both.</ref>

The Chronicle of the Kings of Alba records that Causantín and bishop [[Cellach I of Cennrígmonaid|Cellach]]
{{cquote|met at ''the Hill of Belief'' near the royal city of [[Scone, Perth and Kinross|Scone]] [and] pledged themselves that the laws and disciplines of the faith, and the laws of churches and gospels, should be kept in conformity with the Scotti.}} It is supposed that if any single event may be taken to mark the birth of the [[kingdom of Alba]], then it should be this.<ref>Driscoll, ''Alba'', p. 37; Broun, "Dunkeld"; Herbert, ''Ri Éirenn, Ri Alban''.</ref>

In 914, the [[Annals of Ulster]] report the defeat of Barid son of Oitir by Ragnall grandson of Ivar in the [[Irish Sea]]. It in is the period of dominance of northern Britain by Ragnall and his cousin Sihtric that Causantín is found as an ally of [[Ealdred I of Bernicia|Ealdred]] of [[Bernicia]] and, perhaps, of "Queen" [[Ethelfleda]] of [[Mercia]].<ref>Woolf, "Constantine II"; FA 429, 459.</ref> Armies led by Ragnall and his brother Sihtric raided throughout northern Britain and Ireland.<ref>A partial list, for 915&ndash;918, includes: AU 915.7, 916.3, 916.6, 917.2, 917.3, 917.4, 918.3, 918.6.</ref> They attacked [[Chester]], [[Dumbarton]] and [[Northumbria]]. The [[Uí Ímair]] - the grandsons of Ivar - were the greatest threat to Alba, hence the alliance with the [[Anglo-Saxons]] of Bernicia and Mercia.

While two [[battles of Corbridge]] are claimed, in 915 and 918, only the second is mentioned by the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba and, at some length, by the Annals of Ulster and the [[Fragmentary Annals of Ireland]].<ref>CKA; AU 918.4; FA 429.</ref> The first battle rests on [[Symeon of Durham]]'s ''Historia de Sancto Cuthberto''. <ref>Woolf, "Constantine II" mentions 918 only; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 332&ndash;333 discusses the battles and the dependence on Symeon.</ref> The location in Gaelic sources is vague, [[Corbridge]] again coming from Symeon.<ref> CKA gives ''Tinemore'', as likely to be the [[East Lothian]] Tyne as the Northumbrian [[River Tyne|Tyne]]; AU and FAI are vague.</ref>

==Later period: the English threat==
After Carham, Ragnall seized control of [[York]]. However, in 920, after taking direct control of Mercia soon after Ethelfleda's death, [[Edward the Elder]] forced Ragnall to acknowledge his rule. While neither of the kings may have been happy with the compromise of 920, neither did they live long enough to break the treaty. Ragnall died in 921, succeeded by his cousin [[Sihtric Cáech]]. Edward died in 924, followed by [[Ælfweard of Wessex|Ælfweard]], who reigned for a very short time, succeeded by his half-brother [[Athelstan of England|Athelstan]]. Sihtric may have rebelled in 924, but by 926 he had evidently acknowledged Athelstan as over-king, adopting [[Christianity]] and marrying a sister of Athelstan at [[Tamworth]]. Within the year Sihtric abandoned his new faith and repudiated his unwanted wife. Before Athelstan and he could fight, Sihtric died suddenly in 927.<ref>Higham, ''Kingdom of Northumbria'', pp. 186&ndash;190; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 339&ndash;340.</ref>

Athelstan moved quickly, seizing much of [[Northumbria]], and securing the submission of Sihtric's  brother Gofraid (or Guthfrith), of Ealdred of Bernicia, of Causantín, and of [[Eógan I of Strathclyde|Owain]] of Strathclyde. Sihtric's young son [[Olaf Cuaran|Amlaíb Cuaran]] (Olaf Sihtricsson) fled to Ireland. In less than a decade, the kingdom of [[Wessex]] had become by far the greatest power in Britain and Ireland, and whatever threat the Vikings, or the early [[Uí Ímair]], had posed, clearly the main threat to Alba was now to the south.<ref>Woolf, "Constantine II"; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 339&ndash;340.</ref> As if to prove the point, Athelstan imposed his authority on the kings of [[Wales]], [[Hywel Dda]] and [[Idwal Foel]] among them.<ref>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 340&ndash;341.</ref>

==Brunanburh and after==
By the 930s, Causantín, his son-in-law [[Olaf III Guthfrithson|Amlaíb mac Gofraidh]] (Olaf Guthfrithsson), the Uí Ímair king of [[Dublin]], perhaps together with Owain of Strathclyde, are found in alliance,certainly directed against Athelstan. In 933 or 934, Athelstan led "a great army and fleet" into Scotland and laid waste to the country. If this was intended to bring about Causantín's submission, it appears to have failed.<ref>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle; Woolf, "Constantine II"; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 342.</ref>

In 937, the [[battle of Brunanburh]] was a notable victory for Athelstan and his brother [[Edmund I of England|Edmund]] over Causantín, Amlaíb and Owain. It is commemorated in an [[Old English poetry|Old English poem]].<ref>The poem is recorded in the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]; AU 937.6, portrays the battle as being fought between the Norsemen and the Saxons; CKA.</ref> Owain of Strathclyde is supposed to have died in the battle, as did Cellach son of Causantín.<ref>CKA; Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.</ref> The report of the deaths of Dubucán son of Indrechtach, [[Mormaer of Angus]], Eochaid son of Alpín and of Athelstan follow that for Brunanburh, and may be related to the period  937&ndash;939.<ref>CKA.</ref>

For all that Brunanburh was a great victory, it does not appear to have been sufficient to make rule by the West Saxon kings popular in the [[Danelaw]] and [[Northumbria]]. On 27 October, 939, at [[Malmesbury, Wiltshire|Malmesbury]], as the Annals of Ulster report: "Athelstan, king of the Saxons, pillar of the dignity of the western world, died an untroubled death."<ref>AU 839.6</ref> Before the end of 939, Amlaíb mac Gofraid had seized York without resistance. In 940, he gained control of the Danelaw with little fighting, a treaty being signed with the new West Saxon king, Athelstan's brother Edmund, at the prompting of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, near [[Leicester]]. The following year, Amlaíb turned north, on Bernicia, campaigning as far as [[Tyninghame]] in East Lothian, but he died that year, being succeeded by his cousin Amlaíb Cuaran.<ref>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 356&ndash;358.</ref>

==Abdication and posterity==
The Chronicle of the Kings of Alba states:
{{cquote|And in his old age, being decrepit, [Causantín] took the staff [i.e. entered a monastery], and served the Lord; and he gave up the kingdom to [[Malcolm I of Scotland|Máel [Coluim] son of Domnall]].}}The monastery is assumed to have been that of the [[culdee|Celí Dé]] at [[St Andrews]], probably founded in its Céli Dé form during the reign of Causantín.<ref>Woolf, "Constantine II".</ref>

The Chronicle is not done with Causantín however. It states that in the seventh year of [[Malcolm I of Scotland|Maél Coluim]]'s reign:
{{cquote|[H]e plundered the English as far as the river Tees, and he seized a multitude of people and many herds of cattle: and the Scots called this the raid of Albidosorum, that is, Nainndisi. But others say that Causantín made this raid, asking of the king, Máel Coluim, that the kingship should be given to him for a week's time, so that he could visit the English. In fact, it was Máel Coluim who made the raid, but Causantín incited him, as I have said.}} Causantín's death is recorded by the Chronicle in 952:
{{cquote|And Causantín died in [Maél Coluim's] 10th year [952], under the crown of penitence in good old age.<ref>CKA; cf AU 952.1 where Causantín's death is reported amongst ecclesiastics.</ref>}} 

Causantín's son Cellach died at Brunanburh and a daughter married Amlaíb mac Gofraidh. Causantín himself may have had a Norse or [[Hiberno-Norse]] wife as his son [[Indulf of Scotland|Idulb]] had a gaelicised Norse name.<ref>Walker suggests that the name may represent the Anglo-Saxon Eadwulf, given as Etulbb in the ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 913; see Walker, p. 97.</ref>  The line of kings descended from Causantín appears to have ended with the deaths of his great-grandson [[Constantine III of Scotland|Causantín mac Culéin]] in 997. None the less, the kingdom which he had created existed in much the same form until the [[Scotto-Norman]] reforming kings [[David I of Scotland|David I]], and his grandsons [[Malcolm IV of Scotland|Máel Coluim IV]] and [[William I of Scotland|William the Lion]], brought about a new form of Scottish kingship in the 12th century.
