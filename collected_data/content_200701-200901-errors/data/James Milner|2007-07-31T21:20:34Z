Leeds' relegation to [[Football League Championship|the Championship]] led to speculation over his future at the club. Milner had signed a five year deal with Leeds a year before but regected an improved contract and an offer of doubled wages. [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] all expressed an interest in him. Although Leeds incited that he would not be sold financial problems eventually forced them to sell him. Leeds accepted an offer of £3,600,000 from [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], after they had made enquiries before. This deal rose to £5,000,000 on appearances.

Negotiations between Villa and Newcastle about if he would be signed permanently after his loan spell expired began in May. New Newcastle manager [[Glenn Roeder]] had far more liking for Milner than Souness had, had and was keen to keep him with the club. With a lack of transfer funds at Villa, in addition to a change of management at the club, a deal appeared unlikely. In June Villa rejected an offer for him to be part of a trade for [[Gareth Barry]]<ref>{{cite web

Villa made an improved offer to Newcastle on 30 August and this, after deliberations, was accepted by Newcastle chairman [[Freddy Shepherd]]. Milner traveled to the club for talks on 31 August, the transfer deadline. Milner's agent Mick McGuire belived he was going to sign for Villa and media sources quoted the transfer fee as being £4,000,000. However Newcastle then recalled Milner and the talks broke down.<ref>[http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=415086&plid=15157&clid=7&cpid=8 Roeder backs Milner stance]</ref>

''(Statistics correct as of [[July 28]], [[2007]])''

==Off the pitch==
Milner has always expressed praise for his team mates and managers and has never been reported to have said anything controversial or been involved in any controversial incidents<!-- NOTE: Correct me if I'm wrong. -->. He takes an easy going and optimistic approach to football. He enjoys watching most other sports particularly [[cricket]]. His nickname at Newcastle is 'Machine Gun' because of his ability at playing [[darts]].<ref>[http://icnewcastle.icnetwork.co.uk/newcastleunited/journalsport/tm_headline=harper-hits-the-bullseye&method=full&objectid=18669670&siteid=50081-name_page.html Harper hits the bullseye]</ref> In 2006 he he suffered glandular fever which he recovered from within a month. The only occasion when possible dislike for him has been expressed is when [[Graeme Souness]], his manager at the time said "we’ll never win anything with a team full of James Milners" it is possible however that he was saying because of Milner's lack of experience.

In June 2007 he expressed hope that [[Uefa]] would take action following allegations of [[racism]] from fans at the [[UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|European Under 21 Championship]] but that he was not in any position to suggest what the action should be.<ref>{{cite web
