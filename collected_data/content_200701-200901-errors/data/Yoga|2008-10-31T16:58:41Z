'''Yoga''' ([[Sanskrit]]: [[:wikt:योग|योग]], [[IAST]]: ''yóga'', {{IPA2|joːgə}}) refers to traditional physical and mental disciplines originating in [[India]]; to the goal achieved by those disciplines; and to one of the six orthodox ([[āstika]]) schools of [[Hindu philosophy]].<ref>"Yoga has five principal meanings: 1) yoga as a disciplined method for attaining a goal; 2) yoga as techniques of controlling the body and the mind; 3) yoga as a name of one of the schools or systems of philosophy (''{{IAST|darśana}}''); 4) yoga in connection with other words, such as ''hatha-, mantra-, and laya-'', referring to traditions specialising in particular techniques of yoga; 5) yoga as the goal of yoga practice." Jacobsen, p. 4.</ref><ref>Monier-Williams includes "it is the second of the two Sāṃkhya systems," and "mental abstraction practised as a system (as taught by Patañjali and called the Yoga philosophy)" in his definitions of "yoga".</ref> 

Major branches of yoga include [[Raja Yoga]], [[Karma Yoga]], [[Jnana Yoga]], [[Bhakti Yoga]], and [[Hatha Yoga]].<ref name=yogaTrads1_042007>Pandit Usharbudh Arya (1985).

New Ed edition.</ref> Raja Yoga, compiled in the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]], and known simply as yoga in the context of Hindu philosophy, is part of the [[Samkhya]] tradition.<ref>Jacobsen, p. 4.</ref> Many other [[Hindu texts]] discuss aspects of yoga, including the [[Veda]]s, [[Upanishads]], the [[Bhagavad Gita]], the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]], the [[Shiva Samhita]] and various [[Tantra]]s.

The Sanskrit word ''yoga'' has many meanings,<ref>For a list of 38 meanings of the word "yoga" see: Apte, p. 788.</ref> and is derived from the Sanskrit root ''yuj'', meaning "to control", "to yoke" or "to unite".<ref>For "yoga" as derived from the Sanskrit root "yuj" with meanings of "to control", "to yoke, or "to unite" see: Flood (1996), p. 94.</ref> Translations include "joining",  "uniting",  "union", "conjunction", and "means".<ref>For meaning 1. joining, uniting, and 2., union, junction, combination see: Apte, p. 788.</ref><ref>For "mode, manner, means", see: Apte, p. 788, definition 5.</ref><ref>For "expedient, means in general", see: Apte, p. 788, definition 13.</ref> Outside India, the term ''yoga'' is typically associated with  [[Hatha Yoga]] and its [[asanas]] (postures) or as a [[Yoga as exercise|form of exercise]]. A practitioner of Yoga is called a [[Yogi]] (gender neutral) or [[Yogini]] (feminine form).

==History of yoga==
{{Main|History of yoga}}
While the most ancient mystic practices are vaguely hinted at in the [[Veda]]s, the ascetic practices (''[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]]'') are referenced in the [[Brahmana|{{IAST|Brāhmaṇas}}]] (900 BCE and 500 BCE),<ref>Flood, p. 94.</ref> early commentaries on the [[Vedas]]. The [[Rig Veda]], earliest of the [[Hindu scriptures|Hindu scripture]] mentions the practice.<ref> P. 51 ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Yoga'' By Joan Budilovsky, Eve Adamson </ref> Certainly breath control and curbing the mind was practiced since the Vedic times.<ref> P. 531 ''The Yoga Tradition'' By Georg Feuerstein </ref> Popular yoga writer Georg Feuerstein believes that yoga was fundamental to Vedic ritual, especially to chanting the sacred hymns.<ref> P. 538 ''The Yoga Tradition'' By Georg Feuerstein</ref> 

In the [[Upanishads]], an early reference to meditation is made in [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]],<ref>Flood, p. 94.</ref> one of the earliest Upanishads (approx. 900 BCE). The main textual sources for the evolving concept of Yoga are the middle [[Upanishads]], (ca. 400 BCE), the [[Mahabharata]] (5th c. BCE) including the [[Bhagavad Gita]] (ca. 200 BCE), and the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]] (200 BCE-300 CE). Several seals discovered at [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (c. 3300–1700 BC) sites depict figures in a yoga- or meditation-like posture, "a form of ritual discipline, suggesting a precursor of yoga" that point to Harappan devotion to "ritual discipline and concentration", according to Archaeologist [[Gregory Possehl]].<ref>Possehl (2003), pp.  144-145</ref>

====Yoga Sutras of Patanjali====
{{main|Raja Yoga|Yoga Sutras of Patanjali}}
In [[Indian philosophy]], Yoga is the name of one of the six [[astika|orthodox]] philosophical schools.<ref>For an overview of the six orthodox schools, with detail on the grouping of schools, see: Radhakrishnan and Moore, "Contents", and pp. 453-487.</ref><ref>For a brief overview of the Yoga school of philosophy see: Chatterjee and Datta, p. 43.</ref>  The Yoga philosophical system is closely allied with the [[Samkhya]] school.<ref>For close connection between Yoga philosophy and Samkhya, see: Chatterjee and Datta, p. 43.</ref>  The Yoga school as expounded by Patanjali accepts the Samkhya psychology and metaphysics, but is more theistic than the Samkhya, as evidenced by the addition of a divine entity to the Samkhya's twenty-five elements of reality.<ref>For Yoga acceptance of Samkhya concepts, but with addition of a category for God, see: Radhakrishnan and Moore, p. 453.</ref><ref>For Yoga as accepting the 25 principles of Samkhya with the addition of God, see: Chatterjee and Datta, p. 43.</ref>  The parallels between Yoga and Samkhya were so close that [[Max Müller]] says that "the two philosophies were in popular parlance distinguished from each other as Samkhya with and Samkhya without a Lord...."<ref>Müller (1899), Chapter 7, "Yoga Philosophy", p. 104.</ref> The intimate relationship between Samkhya and Yoga is explained by [[Heinrich Zimmer]]:

<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
These two are regarded in India as twins, the two aspects of a single discipline. {{IAST|Sāṅkhya}} provides a basic theoretical exposition of human nature, enumerating and defining its elements, analyzing their manner of co-operation in a state of bondage (''[[bandha]]''), and describing their state of disentanglement or separation in release (''[[moksha|{{IAST|mokṣa}}]]''), while Yoga treats specifically of the dynamics of the process for the disentanglement, and outlines practical techniques for the gaining of release, or 'isolation-integration' (''kaivalya'').<ref>Zimmer (1951), p. 280.</ref>
</blockquote>

The sage [[Patanjali]] is widely regarded as the founder of the formal Yoga philosophy.<ref>For [[Patanjali]] as the founder of the philosophical system called Yoga see: Chatterjee and Datta, p. 42.</ref> Patanjali's yoga is known as [[Raja yoga]], which is a system for control of the mind.<ref>For "raja yoga" as a system for control of the mind and connection to Patanjali's Yoga Sutras as a key work, see: Flood (1996), pp. 96-98.</ref>  Patanjali defines the word "yoga" in his second sutra, which is the definitional sutra for his entire work:

<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">''{{IAST|'''योग: चित्त-वृत्ति निरोध:''' <br> ( yogaś citta-vṛtti-nirodhaḥ ) }}''<br>- Yoga Sutras 1.2</blockquote> 

This terse definition hinges on the meaning of three Sanskrit terms.  I. K. Taimni translates it as "Yoga is the inhibition (''{{IAST|nirodhaḥ}}'') of the modifications (''{{IAST|vṛtti}}'')  of the mind (''{{IAST|citta}}'')".<ref>For text and word-by-word translation as "Yoga is the inhibition of the modifications of the mind" see: Taimni, p. 6.</ref>  [[Swami Vivekananda]] translates the sutra as "Yoga is restraining the mind-stuff (Citta) from taking various forms (Vrittis)."<ref>Vivekanada, p. 115.</ref>  

[[Image:Yogisculpture.JPG|right|thumb|200px|A sculpture of a [[Hindu]] yogi in the [[Birla Mandir]], [[Delhi]]]]

Patanjali's writing also became the basis for a system referred to as "Ashtanga Yoga" ("Eight-Limbed Yoga"). This eight-limbed concept derived from the 29<sup>th</sup> Sutra of the 2<sup>nd</sup> book, and is a core characteristic of practically every Raja yoga variation taught today. The Eight Limbs are:
:(1) [[Yamas|Yama]] (The five "abstentions"): non-violence, non-lying, non-covetousness, non-sensuality, and non-possessiveness.
:(2) [[Niyama]] (The five "observances"): purity, contentment, austerity, study, and surrender to [[god]].
:(3) [[Asana]]: Literally means "seat", and in Patanjali's Sutras refers to the seated position used for meditation.
:(4) [[Pranayama]] ("Lengthening Prāna"): ''Prāna'', life force, or vital energy, particularly, the breath, "āyāma", to lengthen or extend. Also interpreted as control of prana.
:(5) [[Pratyahara]] ("Abstraction"): Withdrawal of the sense organs from external objects.
:(6) [[Dharana]] ("Concentration"): Fixing the attention on a single object.
:(7) [[Dhyana]] ("Meditation"): Intense contemplation of the nature of the object of meditation.
:(8) [[Samadhi]] ("Liberation"): merging consciousness with the object of meditation.

====Bhagavad Gita====
{{Main|Bhagavad Gita}}
The Bhagavad Gita ('Song of the Lord'), uses the term ''yoga'' extensively in a variety of ways.  In addition to an entire chapter (ch. 6) dedicated to traditional yoga practice, including meditation,<ref>Flood, p. 10.</ref> it introduces three prominent types of yoga:<ref>"...Bhagavad Gita, including a complete chapter (ch. 6) devoted to traditional yoga practice. The Gita also introduces the famous three kinds of yoga, 'knowledge' (jnana), 'action' (karma), and 'love' (bhakti)." Flood, p. 96.</ref> 

*[[Karma yoga]]: The yoga of action
*[[Bhakti yoga]]: The yoga of devotion
*[[Jnana yoga]]: The yoga of knowledge

[[Madhusudana Sarasvati]] (b. circa 1490) divided the Gita into three sections, with the first six chapters dealing with Karma yoga, the middle six with Bhakti yoga, and the last six with Jnana (knowledge).<ref> Gambhirananda, p. 16.</ref> Other commentators ascribe a different 'yoga' to each chapter, delineating eighteen different yogas.<ref>Jacobsen, p. 46.</ref>

====Hatha Yoga====
{{Main|Hatha yoga|Hatha Yoga Pradipika}}

Hatha Yoga is a particular system of Yoga described by [[Yogi Swatmarama]], compiler of the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]] in 15th century India. Hatha Yoga differs substantially from the [[Raja Yoga]] of Patanjali in that it focuses on ''[[shatkarma]]'', the purification of the physical body as leading to the purification of the mind (''ha''), and ''[[prana]]'', or vital energy (''tha'').<ref>Living Yoga: Creating a Life Practice - Page 42 by Christy Turlington (page 42)</ref><ref>Guiding Yoga's Light: Yoga Lessons for Yoga Teachers - Page 10 by Nancy Gerstein </ref> Compared to the seated asana, or sitting meditation posture, of Patanjali's Raja yoga,<ref>Mindfulness Yoga: The Awakened Union of Breath Body & Mind - Page 6 by Frank Jude Boccio</ref> it marks the development of ''asanas'' (plural) as full body 'postures' now in popular usage.<ref name=Burley>Hatha Yoga: Its Context, Theory and Practice By Mikel Burley (page 16)</ref>

Hatha Yoga in its many modern variations is the style that many people associate with the word "Yoga" today.<ref>Feuerstein, Georg. (1996). ''The Shambhala Guide to Yoga''. Boston & London: Shambhala Publications, Inc.</ref> Because its emphasis is on the body through ''asana'' and ''pranayama'' practice, many western students are satisfied with the physical health and vitality it develops and are not interested in the other seven limbs of the Raja Yoga tradition.{{Fact|date=September 2008}}

==Yoga practices in other traditions==
===Yoga and Sufism===

The development of Sufism was considerably influenced by Indian yogic practises, where they adapted both physical postures ([[asanas]]) and breath control ([[pranayama]]).<ref>[http://www.unc.edu/~cernst/articles/JRAS2.doc Situating Sufism and Yoga]</ref> The ancient Indian yogic text, Amritakunda, ("Pool of Nectar)" was translated into Arabic and Persian as early as the 11th century. <ref> [http://www.unc.edu/depts/islamsem/980522.shtml Carolina Seminar on Comparative Islamic Studies] </ref>

[[Yogacara]] (Sanskrit: "Practice of Yoga [Union]"<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9077982/Yogacara Encyclopedia Britannica Article: Yogacara]</ref> ), also spelled yogāchāra, is a school of philosophy and psychology that developed in [[India]] during the 4th to 5th centuries.

Yogacara received the name as it provided a ''yoga'', a framework for engaging in the practices that lead to the path of the [[bodhisattva]].<ref>Dan Lusthaus.

====Ch'an (Seon/Zen) Buddhism====
Zen (the name of which derives from the Sanskrit "dhyana" via the Chinese "ch'an"<ref> The Buddhist Tradition in India, China, and Japan. Edited by William Theodore de Bary. Pgs. 207-208.ISBN 0-394-71696-5 - "The Meditation school, called ''Ch'an'' in Chinese from the Sanskrit ''dhyāna'', is best known in the West by the Japanese pronunciation ''Zen''"</ref>) is a form of [[Mahayana Buddhism]].

Heisig, Paul F. Knitter (page 13)</ref>

====Tibetan Buddhism====
Yoga is central to [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. In the [[Nyingma]] tradition, practitioners progress to increasingly profound levels of yoga, starting with [[Mahayoga|Mahā yoga]], continuing to [[Anuyoga|Anu yoga]] and ultimately undertaking the highest practice, [[Atiyoga|Ati yoga]]. In the [[Sarma]] traditions, the [[Anuttara yoga]] class is equivalent. Other tantra yoga practices include a system of 108 bodily postures practiced with breath and heart rhythm.  Timing in movement exercises is known as [[Trul khor]] or union of moon and sun (channel) prajna energies.  The body postures of Tibetan ancient yogis are depicted on the walls of the Dalai Lama's summer temple of [[Lukhang]]. A semi-popular account of Tibetan Yoga by Chang (1993) refers to Dumo, the generation of heat in one's own body, as being "the very foundation of the whole of Tibetan  Yoga" (Chang, 1993, p7). Chang also claims that Tibetan Yoga involves reconciliation of apparent polarities, such as [[prana]] and mind, relating this to theoretical implications of [[tantrism]].

===Yoga and Tantra===
{{Main|Tantra}}
Tantrism is a practice that is supposed to alter the relation of its practitioners to the ordinary social, religious, and logical reality in which they live. Through [[Tantric]] practice an individual perceives reality as [[maya (illusion)|maya]], illusion, and the individual achieves liberation from it.<ref name=UCP>Title: Mesocosm: Hinduism and the Organization of a Traditional Newar City in Nepal. Author: Robert I. Levy. Published: University of California Press,  1991. pp 313 </ref> This particular path to salvation among the several offered by Hinduism, links Tantrism to those practices of [[Indian religions]], such as yoga, meditation, and social [[renunciation]], which are based on temporary or permanent withdrawal from social relationships and modes.<ref name=UCP/>

During tantric practices and studies, the student is instructed further in meditation technique, particularly [[Chakra|chakra meditation]]. This is often in a limited form in comparison with the way this kind of meditation is known and used by Tantric practitioners and yogis elsewhere, but is more elaborate than the initiate's previous meditation. It is considered to be a kind of [[Kundalini Yoga]] for the purpose of moving the Goddess into the chakra located in the "heart," for meditation and worship.<ref>Title: Mesocosm: Hinduism and the Organization of a Traditional Newar City in Nepal. Author: Robert I. Levy. Published: University of California Press,  1991. pp 317 </ref>

==Goal of yoga==
The goal of yoga may range from anywhere between improved health and reaching ''[[Moksha]]''.<ref>Jacobsen, p. 10.</ref> Within the [[Monism|monist]] schools of [[Advaita Vedanta]] and [[Shaivism]] the goal of yoga takes the form of Moksha, which is liberation from all worldly suffering and the cycle of birth and death ([[Samsara]]), at which point there is a realisation of identity with the Supreme [[Brahman]]. In the Mahabharata, the goal of yoga is variously described as entering the world of [[Brahma]], as [[Brahman]], or as perceiving the Brahman or [[Atman]] that pervades all things.<ref>Jacobsen, p. 9.</ref> For the [[bhakti]] schools of [[Vaishnavism]], ''bhakti'' or service to ''[[Svayam bhagavan]]'' itself is the ultimate goal of the yoga process, wherein perfection culminates in an eternal relationship with [[Vishnu]], [[Rama]] or [[Krsna]].<ref>[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9381693/Vaishnavism Brittanica Concise] "Characterized by an emphasis on bhakti, its goal is to escape from the cycle of birth and death in order to enjoy the presence of Vishnu."</ref>
