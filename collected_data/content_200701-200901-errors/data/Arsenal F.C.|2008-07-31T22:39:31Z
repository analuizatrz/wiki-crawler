'''Arsenal Football Club ''' (also known as '''Arsenal''', '''The Arsenal''' or '''The Gunners''') are an [[England|English]] professional [[association football|football]] club based in [[Holloway, London|Holloway]], [[North London]]. They play in the [[Premier League]] and are one of the [[Football records in England#Most successful clubs overall (1888 - present)|most successful clubs]] in [[Football in England|English football]], having won thirteen [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and Premier League titles and ten [[FA Cup]]s.

Arsenal were founded in 1886, though they won their first major trophies in the 1930s, with five League Championship titles and two FA Cups. After a lean period in the post-war years they became the second club of the 20th century to win [[the Double]] in [[1970-71 in English football|1970–71]], and during the past twenty years they have been one of the most successful clubs in English football – in this time Arsenal won two further Doubles, the Premier League in [[2003-04 in English football|2003–04]] unbeaten, and in [[UEFA Champions League 2005-06|2005–06]] became the first [[Football in London|London club]] to reach the [[UEFA Champions League]] [[UEFA Champions League Final 2006|Final]].

The club's colours have traditionally been red and white, although these have evolved through history. Similarly, the club have changed location over time; the team were initially founded in [[Woolwich]], south-east [[London]], but in 1913 they moved north across the city to [[Arsenal Stadium]], [[Highbury]]. In 2006 they made a less drastic move to their current home, the [[Emirates Stadium]] in nearby [[Holloway, London|Holloway]].

Arsenal have a large fanbase, who hold a string of long-standing rivalries with several other clubs; the most notable of these is with neighbours [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], with whom they regularly contest the [[North London derby]]. Arsenal are one of the richest clubs in English football (worth over £600m as of 2007), and thanks to their stature, have regularly featured in portrayals of football in [[British culture]]. [[Arsenal L.F.C.|Arsenal Ladies]] are the most successful English club in [[women's football (soccer)|women's football]] and are also affiliated with the club.

Arsenal were founded as '''Dial Square''' in 1886 by workers at the [[Royal Arsenal]] in [[Woolwich]], but were renamed '''Royal Arsenal''' shortly afterwards. They renamed themselves again to '''Woolwich Arsenal''' after turning professional in 1891. The club joined [[the Football League]] in 1893, starting out in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], and won promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1904. However, the club's geographic isolation resulted in lower attendances than those of other clubs, which led to the club becoming mired in financial problems and effectively bankrupt by 1910, when they were taken over by [[Henry Norris]].<ref>{{cite book |

In 1925, Arsenal appointed [[Herbert Chapman]] as manager. Chapman had already won the league twice with [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] in [[1923-24 in English football|1923–24]] and [[1924-25 in English football|1924–25]], and he brought Arsenal their first period of major success. His revolutionary tactics and training, along with the signings of star players such as [[Alex James (footballer)|Alex James]] and [[Cliff Bastin]], laid the foundations of the club's domination of English football in the 1930s. Under his guidance Arsenal won their first major trophies – an FA Cup in [[1929-30 in English football|1929–30]] and two League Championships, in [[1930-31 in English football|1930–31]] and [[1932-33 in English football|1932–33]]. In addition, Chapman was reportedly behind the 1932 renaming of the local [[London Underground]] station from "Gillespie Road" to "[[Arsenal tube station|Arsenal]]", making it the only Tube station to be named specifically after a football club.<ref>{{cite web |

Chapman died suddenly of [[pneumonia]] in early 1934, but [[Joe Shaw (footballer born 1883)|Joe Shaw]] and [[George Allison]] carried on his successful work. Under their guidance, Arsenal won three more titles ([[1933-34 in English football|1933–34]], [[1934-35 in English football|1934–35]] and [[1937-38 in English football|1937–38]]) and an FA Cup ([[1935-36 in English football|1935–36]]). However Arsenal had started to fade by the decade's end, when the intervention of [[World War II]] meant competitive professional football in England was suspended.

After the war, under Allison's successor [[Tom Whittaker (footballer)|Tom Whittaker]], Arsenal enjoyed a second period of success, winning the league in [[1947-48 in English football|1947–48]] and [[1952-53 in English football|1952–53]], and the FA Cup in [[1949-50 in English football|1949–50]]. However, after that their fortunes waned; unable to attract players of the same calibre as they had in the 1930s, the club spent most of the 1950s and 1960s in trophyless mediocrity. Even former [[England national football team|England]] captain [[Billy Wright (footballer)|Billy Wright]] could not bring the club any success as manager, in a stint between 1962 and 1966.

Arsenal began winning silverware again with the surprise appointment of club [[physiotherapy|physiotherapist]] [[Bertie Mee]] as manager in 1966. After losing two [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] finals, they won the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]], their first European trophy, in [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1969-70|1969–70]]. This was followed by an even greater triumph: their first League and FA Cup [[the Double|double]] in [[1970-71 in English football|1970–71]]. However, the Double-winning side was soon broken up and the following decade was characterised by a series of near misses. Arsenal finished as First Division runners-up in [[1972-73 in English football|1972–73]], lost three FA Cup finals ([[1971-72 in English football|1971–72]], [[1977-78 in English football|1977–78]] and [[1979-80 in English football|1979–80]]) and lost the 1979–80 [[Cup Winners' Cup]] final on [[penalty shootout (football)|penalties]]. The club's only success during this time was an FA Cup win in [[1978-79 in English football|1978–79]], with a last-minute 3–2 victory over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] that is widely regarded as a classic.<ref>A 2005 poll of English football fans rated the 1979 FA Cup Final the 15th greatest game of all time.

The return of former player [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] as manager in 1986 brought a third period of glory. Arsenal won the League Cup in [[1986-87 in English football|1986–87]], Graham's first season in charge. This was followed by a League title win in [[1988-89 in English football|1988–89]], won with a last-minute goal in the final game of the season against fellow title challengers [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. Graham's Arsenal won another title in [[1990-91 in English football|1990–91]], losing only one match, the FA Cup and League Cup double in [[1992-93 in English football|1992–93]] and a second European trophy, the [[Cup Winners' Cup]], in [[1993-94 in English football|1993–94]]. However, Graham's reputation was tarnished when it was revealed that he had taken kickbacks from agent [[Rune Hauge]] for signing certain players,<ref>Graham was banned for a year by the Football Association for his involvement in the scandal after he admitted he had received an "unsolicited gift" from Hauge.

The club's success in the late 1990s and 2000s owes a great deal to the appointment of manager [[Arsène Wenger]] in 1996. Wenger brought new tactics, a new training regime and several foreign players who complemented the existing English talent. Arsenal won a second league and cup double in [[1997-98 in English football|1997–98]] and a third in [[2001-02 in English football|2001–02]]. In addition, the club reached the final of the [[UEFA Cup 1999-00|1999–00]] [[UEFA Cup]] (losing on penalties to [[Galatasaray S.K.|Galatasaray]]), were victorious in the [[2002-03 in English football|2002–03]] and [[2004-05 in English football|2004–05]] FA Cups, and won the Premier League in [[2003-04 in English football|2003–04]] without losing a single match, which earned the side the nickname "[[The Invincibles (football)|The Invincibles]]";<ref name="invincibles">{{cite news

[[Image:Arsenal fc old crest small.png|thumb|160px|A version of the Arsenal crest used from 1949 to 2002.]]
Royal Arsenal's first crest, unveiled in 1888, featured three [[cannon]]s viewed from above, pointing northwards, similar to the [[coat of arms]] of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich]]. These can sometimes be mistaken for [[chimney]]s, but the presence of a carved lion's head and a [[wikt:cascabel|cascabel]] on each are clear indicators that they are cannon.<ref name="crest">{{cite web |

}}</ref> This was dropped after the moved to Highbury in 1913, but in 1922, the club adopted their first single-cannon crest, featuring an eastward-pointing cannon, with the club's nickname, ''The Gunners'', inscribed alongside it; this crest only lasted until 1925, when the cannon was reversed to point westward and its barrel slimmed down.<ref name="crest"/> In 1949, the club unveiled a modernised crest featuring the same style of cannon, the club's name set in [[blackletter]] above the cannon, the coat of arms of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Islington]] and a scroll inscribed with the club's newly adopted [[Latin]] [[motto]], ''Victoria Concordia Crescit'' (meaning "victory comes from harmony"), coined by Harry Homer, the club's programme editor.<ref name="crest"/> For the first time, the crest was rendered in colour, which varied slightly over the crest's lifespan, finally becoming red, gold and green.

Because of the numerous revisions of the crest, Arsenal were unable to [[copyright]] it. Although the club had managed to register the crest as a [[trademark]], and had fought (and eventually won) a long legal battle with a local street trader who sold 'unofficial' Arsenal merchandise,<ref>{{cite web

For much of Arsenal's history, their home colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though this has not always been the case. The choice of red is in recognition of a charitable donation from [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, [[Fred Beardsley]] and [[Morris Bates]], were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball. The shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red similar to burgundy, and was worn with white shorts and blue socks.<ref name="squadphotos">{{cite web |

In 1933 Herbert Chapman, wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter [[pillar box]] red. The origin of the white sleeves is not conclusively known, but two possible inspirations have been put forward. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the [[cartoonist]] [[Tom Webster (cartoonist)|Tom Webster]], with whom Chapman played [[golf]].<ref name="kitdesign">{{cite web |

The first was [[1966-67 in English football|1966–67]], when Arsenal wore all-red shirts;<ref name="squadphotos" /> this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season. The second was [[2005-06 in English football|2005–06]], the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury, when the team wore one-year commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913, their first season in the stadium. The club reverted to their traditional colours at the start of the [[2006-07 in English football|2006–07]] season.

Arsenal's home colours have been the inspiration for at least three other clubs. In 1909, [[AC Sparta Praha|Sparta Prague]] adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time;<ref name="kitdesign"/> in 1938, [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip.<ref>{{cite web |

For the majority of their time in south-east London, Arsenal played at the [[Manor Ground, Plumstead|Manor Ground]] in [[Plumstead]], a three-year period at the nearby [[Invicta Ground]] between 1890 and 1893 excepted. The Manor Ground was initially just a field, but the club installed stands and terracing in time for their first Football League match in September 1893. They played their home games there for the next twenty years (with two exceptions in [[1894-95 in English football|1894–95]]), until the move to north London in 1913.

[[Arsenal Stadium]], widely referred to as Highbury, was Arsenal's home from September 1913 until May 2006. The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect [[Archibald Leitch]], and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered stand and three open-air banks of [[stadium|terracing]].<ref name="conservation_plan">{{cite web | url=http://www.islington.gov.uk/DownloadableDocuments/Environment/Pdf/highburyconservationplan_2005.pdf |

At its peak, Highbury could hold over 60,000 spectators, and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The [[Taylor Report]] and [[Premier League]] regulations forced Arsenal to convert Highbury into an all-seater in time for the [[1993-94 in English football|1993–94]] season, reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators.<ref>{{cite web

Expansion of Highbury was restricted because the East Stand had been designated as a Grade II [[listed building]] and the other three stands were close to residential properties.<ref name="conservation_plan"/> These limitations have prevented the club from maximising the revenue that their domestic form could have brought in recent seasons. After considering various options, in 2000 Arsenal proposed building a new 60,000-seater stadium at Ashburton Grove, since renamed the [[Emirates Stadium]], about 500 metres south-west of Highbury.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/1011234.stm | title=Arsenal unveil new stadium plans | work=BBC Sport | date=2000-11-07 | accessdate=2007-03-27 }}</ref> The project was initially delayed by red tape and rising costs,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/2953273.stm | title=Arsenal stadium delay | work=BBC Sport | date=2003-04-16 | | accessdate=2007-03-27 }}</ref> but construction was completed in July 2006, in time for the start of the [[2006-07 in English football|2006–07]] season.

==Supporters==

Arsenal have a large and generally loyal fanbase, with virtually all home matches selling out; in 2007–08 Arsenal had the second-highest average League attendance for an English club (60,070, which was 99.5% of available capacity),<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tonykempster.co.uk/prematt.htm?comp=1 | title=Attendances 2007/08 | author=Kempster, Tony | accessdate=2008-06-04 }}</ref> and as of 2006, the fourth-highest all-time average attendance.<ref>{{cite web |

}} Please note that some pre-war attendance figures used by this source were estimates and may not be entirely accurate.</ref> Arsenal fans often refer to themselves as "Gooners", the name being derived from the team's nickname, "The Gunners". The club's location, adjoining both wealthy areas such as [[Canonbury]] and [[Barnsbury]], mixed areas such as [[Islington]], [[Holloway]] and [[Highbury]], and the adjacent [[London Borough of Camden]], and largely working class areas such as [[Finsbury Park]] and [[Stoke Newington]] has meant that Arsenal's supporters have come from across the usual class divides.

Like all major English football clubs, Arsenal have a number of domestic supporters' clubs, including the Official Arsenal Football Supporters Club, which is affiliated with the club, and the Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association, which maintains an independent line. There is also the [[Arsenal Supporters' Trust]], which promotes greater participation in ownership of the club by fans. The club's supporters also publish [[fanzine]]s such as ''The Gooner'', ''Highbury High'', ''Gunflash'' and the less cerebral ''Up The Arse!''. In addition to the usual English [[football chant]]s, Arsenal's supporters sing "One-Nil to the Arsenal" (to the tune of "[[Go West (song)|Go West]]") and "Boring, Boring Arsenal", which used to be a common taunt from opposition fans but is now sung ironically by Arsenal supporters when the team is playing well.<ref>{{cite news |

In recent times, a supporter's attachment to a football club has become less dependent on geography, and Arsenal now have many fans not just from London but all over England and the world. While there have always been small pockets of supporters abroad, Arsenal's support base has widened considerably with the advent of [[satellite television]], and there are now significant supporters' clubs worldwide. A 2005 report by Granada Ventures, which at the time owned a 9.9% stake in the club, estimated Arsenal's global fanbase at 27 million, the third largest in the world.<ref>{{cite web

Arsenal's longest-running and deepest rivalry is with their nearest major neighbours, [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], with matches between the two being referred to as [[North London derby|North London derbies]]. Matches against other London sides, such as [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] are also [[derby match|derbies]], but the rivalry is not as intense as that between Arsenal and Tottenham. In addition, Arsenal and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] have had a strong on-pitch rivalry since the late 1980s, which has intensified in recent years when both clubs have been competing for the Premier League title.<ref>{{cite news |

==Ownership and finances==
Arsenal's parent company, Arsenal Holdings plc, operates as a [[financial quote|non-quoted]] [[public limited company]], but Arsenal's ownership is considerably different from that of other football clubs. Only 62,217 shares in Arsenal have been issued,<ref name="annualreport2007"/> and they are not traded on a public exchange such as the [[FTSE]] or [[Alternative Investment Market|AIM]]; instead, they are traded infrequently on PLUS, a specialist market. As of [[February 18]] [[2008]], a share in Arsenal has a mid price of £8,700, meaning the club's [[market capitalisation]] value is approximately £541.3m.<ref>{{cite web

==Arsenal in popular culture==
As one of the most successful teams in the country, Arsenal have often featured when football is depicted in [[British culture]] and have appeared in a number of media "firsts". On [[January 22]] [[1927]], their match at Highbury against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] was the first English League match to be broadcast live on [[radio]].<ref>{{cite web

Arsenal also formed the backdrop to one of the earliest football-related [[film]]s, ''[[The Arsenal Stadium Mystery]]'' (1939).<ref>{{cite web |

 url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031055/ |

 accessdate=2007-02-02

}}</ref> The film is centred on a [[friendly match]] between Arsenal and an amateur side, one of whose players is poisoned whilst playing. Many Arsenal players appeared as themselves, although only manager George Allison was given a speaking part.

More recently, the book ''[[Fever Pitch]]'' by [[Nick Hornby]] was an [[autobiography|autobiographical]] account of Hornby's life and relationship with football and Arsenal in particular. Published in 1992, it formed part of, and may have played an active part in, the revival and rehabilitation of football in British society during the 1990s. The book was later made into a film starring [[Colin Firth]], which centred on the club's [[1988-89 in English football|1988–89]] title win. 

The book also inspired an [[United States|American]] [[Fever Pitch (2005 movie)|film adaptation]] by the same name, about a fan of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Boston Red Sox]]. The film featured [[Jimmy Fallon]], and [[Drew Barrymore]] and began to be shown in movie theater's in 2005.

Arsenal have often been stereotyped as a defensive and "boring" side, especially during the 1970s and 1980s; many comedians, such as [[Eric Morecambe]], made jokes about this at the team's expense. The theme was repeated in the 1997 film ''[[The Full Monty]]'', in a scene where the lead actors move in a line and raise their hands, deliberately mimicking the Arsenal defence's [[Offside law (football)|offside]] trap, in an attempt to co-ordinate their [[stripping]].<ref name="atthemovies">{{cite web |

The club have also been mentioned in several ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' sketches, and in [[Douglas Adams]]' ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', where a barman remarks that the impending end of the world is a "lucky escape" for Arsenal. Additionally, in the 2004 film ''[[Ocean's Twelve]]'', the main characters don Arsenal tracksuits as a disguise, in order to escape from a hotel during one of their European heists.

Arsenal have featured in popular music as well; [[Joe Strummer]] wrote the song "[[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]]", dedicated to the then Arsenal captain, which appeared on his 1999 album ''[[Rock Art and the X-Ray Style]].''  Strummer was also known to wear an Arsenal scarf during gigs despite himself being a Chelsea fan. Additionally, Arsenal (along with arch-rivals Tottenham Hotspur) receive a mention in [[The Pogues]] song "Billy's Bones", which appears on the band's second album, ''[[Rum, Sodomy and the Lash]].''

Arsenal Ladies are the most successful team in [[Women's football in England|English women's football]]; they are the current reigning champions of the [[FA Women's Premier League]] and holders of the [[FA Women's Cup]]; they are also the only English side to have won the [[UEFA Women's Cup]], having done so in the [[UEFA Women's Cup 2006-07|2006–07]] season as part of a unique quadruple.

Arsenal have also set records in English football, most notably the most consecutive seasons spent in the top flight (81 as of 2007–08) and the longest run of unbeaten League matches (49 between May 2003 and October 2004). This included all 38 matches of their title-winning [[2003-04 in English football|2003–04]] season, making Arsenal only the second club ever to finish a top-flight campaign unbeaten, after [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] (who played only 22 matches) in [[1888-89 in English football|1888–89]].<ref name="invincibles"/>

Arsenal also set a UEFA Champions League record during the 2005–06 season by going ten matches without conceding a goal, beating the previous best of seven set by [[A.C. Milan]]. They went a record total stretch of 995 minutes without letting an opponent score; the streak finally ended in the final against [[FC Barcelona]], when [[Samuel Eto'o]] scored Barcelona's equaliser in the 76th minute.<ref name="2006ucl">{{cite news|
