The '''European Union''' ('''EU''') is a ''[[sui generis]]'' political body, made up of twenty-seven [[nation state|member state]]s, the majority of which are located in continental [[Europe]]. It was established in 1993  by the [[Maastricht Treaty|Treaty on European Union]] (The Maastricht Treaty) and is the [[de facto]] successor to the six-member [[European Economic Community]] founded in 1957. Since then new [[Enlargement of the European Union|accessions]] have raised its number of [[European Union member states|member states]], and competences have expanded. As a result, the EU can be described as both a [[supranationalism|supranational]] and [[intergovernmentalism|intergovernmental]] body. 

The EU is the second largest economy in the world with a combined nominal [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of €11.6 ([[US$]]15.7) trillion in 2007.<ref name="GDP IMF">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=World Economic Outlook Database|work=|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|date=2007|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2007/01/data/weorept.aspx?pr.x=48&pr.y=13&sy=2004&ey=2008&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=998&s=NGDPD%2CPPPWGT&grp=1&a=1|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> The Union is a [[single market]] with a common trade policy,<ref name="Europa Internal Market">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Actitivies of the European Union: Internal Market|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/pol/singl/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> a [[Common Agricultural Policy|Common Agricultural]]/[[Common Fisheries Policy|Fisheries Policy]], and a [[European Union Regional policy|Regional policy]] to assist underdeveloped regions.<ref name"Farah">{{cite web|last=Farah|first=Paolo|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Five Years of China WTO Membership.

==History==
{{main|History of the European Union}}
The [[Second World War]] from 1939 to 1945 saw unprecedented devastation and extremism in Europe and its division between two ideologically opposed superpowers. The situation rekindled a long held idea of European unification optimised with the development of European institutions. For example, in 1946, [[Winston Churchill]] called for a ''[[United States of Europe]]'', the first step of which would be a [[Council of Europe]], which was shortly established. On [[9 May]] [[1950]], following the [[Schuman Declaration]], based on a plan by [[Jean Monnet]], gave rise to the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) the goal of which was to integrate the markets for those resources, being the two elements necessary to make weapons of war. The founding members of the community who signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)]] were [[France]], [[Italy]], the [[Benelux]] countries ([[Belgium]], [[Netherlands]] and [[Luxembourg]]) together with [[West Germany]].<ref name="ENA WW2">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Europe in ruins in the aftermath of the Second World War|work=|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|date=|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=243|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref><ref name="Europa History 45-59">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=A peaceful Europe - the beginnings of cooperation|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1945-1959/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

[[Image:Rometreaty.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The founding nations signing the [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957]]
A further two communities were created by the [[Treaties of Rome]] in 1957; the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) and the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (Euratom). They dealt with the development of the [[Customs Union]] and [[nuclear energy]] cooperation respectively. All three communities were eventually merged in 1967 into the [[European Communities]] with a single set of institutions and membership.<ref name="ENA Euratom">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=A European Atomic Energy Community|work=|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|date=|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=3054|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref><ref name="ENA EEC">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=A European Customs Union|work=|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|date=|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=3056|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref><ref name="ENA Merge">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Merging the executives|work=|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|date=|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=473|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

[[Image:OffeneGrenzeNiederndorf-Oberaudorf.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An open Schengen border near [[Kufstein]], [[Austria]]]]
Since 1985 the [[Schengen Agreement]] has been signed by 30 states, including most EU states and three non-EU members [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], and [[Switzerland]]. The agreement among [[Europe|European]] states allows for the abolition of systematic border controls between the participating countries. It also includes provisions on common [[immigration policy|policy on the temporary entry of persons]] (including the Schengen Visa), the harmonisation of external [[border]] controls, and cross-border police co-operation. 15 member states have implemented the agreement so far. The [[Republic of Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]] only take part in the police co-operation measures and not the common border control and visa provisions.<ref name="Europa Schengen acquis">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The Schengen acquis and its integration into the Union|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=2005|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l33020.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref>

In 1994 the [[European Economic Area]] was established integrating [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Norway]] into the Union's [[single market]], and in 1995 [[Austria]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] joined the EU. In 1999 the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] was signed under the shadow of the [[resignation of the Santer Commission]]. In the same year the [[euro]] was introduced and replaced national currencies in 12 members in 2002. In 2003 the [[Nice Treaty]] came into force, followed a year later by the [[Enlargement of the European Union|accession]] of 6 eastern European countries along with [[Malta]] and [[Cyprus]]. Later that year the [[European Constitution]] was signed, however it was rejected in following year by French and Dutch voters. A replacement [[Reform Treaty]] was agreed in 2007.<ref name="Europa History 90-99"/><ref name="Europa History 00">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=A decade of further expansion|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/2000_today/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

The territory of the European Union is formed by the territory of its twenty-seven member states so is not coterminous with Europe: significant parts of the continent (e.g. [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]], European [[Russia]]) are outside of the Union. On [[23 July]] [[1952]] six founding members formed the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC), which was transformed into the [[European Community]], later renamed the European Union, in waves of accession.<ref name="Delegation History">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Brief History of European Integration|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Delegation of the European Commission to Japan]]|date=|url=http://www.deljpn.ec.europa.eu/union/showpage_en_union.history.php|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> The Union now has 27 members covering an area of {{convert|4422773|sqkm|sqmi|0|lk=on}}.<ref name=Area.and.population.figure>Figure including the four [[overseas department|French overseas departments]] ([[French Guiana]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[Réunion]]) which are an integral part of the European Union, but excluding the [[Overseas collectivity|French overseas collectivities]] and [[Overseas territory (France)|territories]], which are not part of the European Union.</ref> extending north-east to Finland, north west to Ireland, south-east to Cyprus and south-west to Portugal, it represents the [[List of countries by area|seventh largest territory in the world by area]]. It is estimated that the coastline of the European Union is over 150,000 km long. The member states of the EU have [[countries bordering the European Union|land borders]] with 21 other nations.<ref name="Europa Members">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=European countries|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=2007|url=http://europa.eu/abc/european_countries/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>

Certain areas of the member countries are not part of the EU, like the [[Channel Islands]], or the [[Faroe Islands]]. Several overseas territories and dependencies of various member states are also formally part of the EU (e.g. the [[Azores]], [[Madeira]], [[French Guiana]], [[Martinique]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], or the [[Canary Islands]]) and, for example, use the euro.<ref name="Europa History 45-59">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Where is the euro legal tender?|work=|publisher=[[European Central Bank]]|date=2006|url=http://www.ecb.int/bc/faqbc/circulation/html/index.en.html#q2|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> In other cases territories associated with member states are not part of the EU (e.g. [[Greenland]], the [[Faroe Islands]], most territories associated to the United Kingdom, [[Aruba]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]] or [[New Caledonia]]).

{{main|Politics of the European Union}}
The politics of the Union primarily cover the economy, having been formed as a series of economic communities after the Second World War. As the Maastricht Treaty established the European Union, the [[Three pillars of the European Union|pillar system]] was established whereby foreign and home affairs became an intergovernmental domain of the EU.<ref name="Glossary Pillars">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Pillars of the European Union|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/eu_pillars_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> 

Often it is the nature of the Union itself that dominates the political scene.

[[Image:Consttreat.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The proposed [[Reform Treaty]] is the intended to come in force 2009]]

In 2007 a new [[Reform Treaty]] is being agreed by leaders that would make a number of changes to the existing treaties which form the basis of the Union.

A further issues is that surrounding the [[EU budget]].

The rebate is a discount on the amount the UK contributes to the budget due to the UK receiving less than other countries from the agricultural policy, which had historically dominated the Union's spending.

===European Community===

{{main|European Community}}
The European Community is the oldest, supranational, element of the Union. Formerly the European Economic Community, it is now the first pillar of the European Union. It is within this pillar where sovereignty is pooled and put under the control of the supranational institutions such as the Commission and Parliament. For example, within Community matters the Commission has the sole right to initiate legislation where as under the intergovernmental third pillar that right is held by members. The principle of subsidiarity in this pillar is designed to ensure that decisions are taken at the lowest level of government.<ref name="Sweden Pillars">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The three pillars of the EU|work=|publisher=[[Presidency of the European Union|Swedish Presidency, 2001]]|date=2007|url=http://www.eu2001.se/static/eng/eu_info/korthet_pelare.asp |format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> Under the Amsterdam Treaty, some powers were moved from the third pillar to the Community<ref name="Glossary Pillars"/> and in 2007, the Court of Justice ruled that the Community has the power to legislate on [[criminal law]].<ref name="Rechtennieuws Powers">{{cite web|last=Duchateau|first=Michiel|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Expanding the powers of the European Community|work=|publisher=Rechtennieuws|date=2007|url= http://rechtennieuws.nl/14414/expanding-the-powers-of-the-european-community.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref>

In addition to such policies such as the agricultural policy, and the [[Common Fisheries Policy]], there are a number of [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds]] which promote development of the poorer, underdeveloped, regions across the Union, such as those in the new member states of eastern Europe.<ref name="Business2000 Funds">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=EU Structural and Cohesion Funds|work=|publisher=Business 2000|url=http://www.business2000.ie/cases/cases_8th/case12.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> Other funds emergency aid, [[Phare]], [[TACIS]], [[Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession|ISPA]] and [[Seventh Framework Programme|Framework Programmes]] dealing with research and technological development working towards a [[European Research Area]].<ref name="Euractiv FP7">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=7th Research Framework Programme (FP7)|work=|publisher=Euractiv|date=2004|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/science/7th-research-framework-programme-fp7/article-117494|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref>

Around the institutions of this pillar, there has been a desire to address the [[democratic deficit in the European Union]] through the development of the [[citizenship of the European Union]].

Defence and security are traditionally matters of national [[sovereignty]]. EU policies in this area were established as the second of the [[three pillars of the European Union|three pillars]] in the Maastricht Treaty of 1992. The ''Common Foreign and Security Policy'' or CFSP were further defined and broadened in the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] of 1997. Amsterdam defined five objectives for the CFSP: to safeguard the common values, fundamental interests, independence and integrity of the Union in conformity with the  principle of the [[United  Nations Charter]]; to strengthen the security of the Union in all ways; to preserve peace and strengthen international security, in  accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter,  as well as the principle of the [[Helsinki  Final Act]] and the objectives of the [[Paris Charter]], including those on external borders; to promote international co-operation; and to develop and consolidate democracy and the rule of law,  and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The policy is coordinated by the [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy]], currently [[Javier Solana]].<ref name="Europa CFSP">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) - Overview|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Commission]]|date=2002|url=http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/cfsp/intro/index.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref>

The [[European Coal and Steel Community]] was founded in 1952 by six countries. Between 1973 and 2007 there have been six waves on enlargement bringing the membership up to 27. The single largest being the 10 members who joined in 2004.<ref name="Delegation History"/> In order for a country to join the Union, they must meet the [[Copenhagen criteria]] (defined at the 1993 [[Copenhagen]] European Council).

The third of the three pillars of the European Union is focusing on cooperation in criminal matters, including sharing of [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] (through [[Europol]] and the [[Schengen Information System]]), agreement on common definition of [[crime|criminal offences]] and expedited [[extradition]] procedures. It is the EU instrument of [[law]] enforcement and combating [[racism]]. [[Eurojust]] is a mirror organisation to Europol, dealing the judicial matters. The pillar was created as the ''Justice and Home Affairs'' pillar in the Treaty of Maastricht; subsequently the Amsterdam Treaty transferred the areas of illegal [[immigration]], [[visa (document)|visas]], [[refugee|asylum]], and judicial co-operation to the integrated first ([[European Community]]) pillar.

==Institutions and bodies==
[[Image:EuroparliamentCROPPED.jpg|thumb|right|210px|The  [[Brussels]] [[European Parliament|seat of Parliament]]]]
{{Main|Institutions of the European Union}}
The European Union is governed by a number of institutions, these primarily being the [[European Commission|Commission]], [[Council of the European Union|Council]] and [[European Parliament|Parliament]].

The '''[[European Commission]]''' acts as the [[executive branch]]. It is currently composed of one member from each state (currently 27) and is responsible for drafting all proposed law, a duty on which it maintains a monopoly in order to co-ordinate European Law. It also controls some agencies and the day-to-day running of the Union. Its president is nominated by the European Council then elected by the Parliament.<ref name="Europa Institutions Commission">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Institutions: The European Commission|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

The '''[[Council of the European Union]]''' (aka the Council of Ministers) forms one half of the Union's [[legislative branch]] (the other being the Parliament). It is composed of the national ministers responsible for the area of EU law being addressed, for example a law regarding agriculture would go to a Council composed of national agriculture ministers. This body should not be confused with the [[European Council]] below or the non-EU body, the [[Council of Europe]]. The body's presidency rotates between the member states every 6 months, though the current president member state co-operates with the previous and future president member state, to provide continuity.<ref name="Europa Institutions Council">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Institutions: The Council of the European Union|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/council/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

The '''[[European Parliament]]''' is the only Union body composed of officials directly elected by the citizens of the EU member states. Every 5 years citizens in all member states vote across a few days for 785 "[[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]]" who form the second half of the Union's legislative branch. Its members sit according to political groups rather than nationality and its president is elected by its members.<ref name="Europa Institutions Parliament">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Institutions: The European Parliament|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/parliament/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

[[Image:Eurotower in Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|right|155px|The [[European Central Bank]] in Frankfurt]]

The [[Judicial branch]] of the Union consists primarily of the '''[[European Court of Justice]]''' composed of one judge nominated by each member-state with the president elected from among those nominees. Below the Court of Justice there is a lower court called the '''[[Court of First Instance]]''' created to lift some of the work load of the Court of Justice. There is also the '''[[European Court of Auditors]]''' which monitors the Union's accounts.<ref name="Europa Institutions Justice">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Institutions: Court of Justice|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/justice/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref><ref name="Europa Institutions Auditors">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Institutions: Court of Auditors|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/auditors/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

Another major body, though not an official institution, is the '''[[European Council]]''', composed of the heads of government (along with the [[President of the European Commission]]) meeting 4 times a year. It shares its presidency with that of the Council of the European Union.<ref name="Europa Institutions ECouncil">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=European Council|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|date=|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=429&lang=en|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> The '''[[European Central Bank]]''' controls the [[monetary policy]] within the [[Eurozone]], consisting of 13 member states.

There is no official European capital, with the [[location of European Union institutions]] spread across a number of cities. However, Brussels is often considered the ''de facto'' capital as it hosts most of the primary institutions, including the [[European Commission|Commission]] and the [[Council of the European Union|Council]]. The [[European Parliament|Parliament]] also has its second seat in the city. [[Strasbourg]] is the official seat of the [[European Parliament]], meeting there for twelve week-long plenary sessions each year. [[Luxembourg City]] plays host to the [[Secretariat of the European Parliament]] as well as the [[European Court of Justice]], the [[Court of First Instance]] and the [[European Court of Auditors]].<ref name="Brussels Capital">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Brussels, Capital of Europe|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Commission]]|date=2001|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/policy_advisers/archives/publications/docs/brussels_capital.pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref><ref name="Council Edinburgh">{{cite web|last=European Council|first=|authorlink=European Council|coauthors=|title=European Council in Edinburgh: 11 - 12 December 1992, Annex 6 to Part A|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|date=1992|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/summits/edinburgh/a6_en.pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref>

The two main treaties which form the basis of EU law are the Treaty of the European Community, or the [[Treaty of Rome]] from 1957, and the Treaty of the European Union, or the [[Maastricht treaty]] of 1992. The Treaty of Rome is the so called "first pillar" of the EU. The "European Community" refers to the competence of the EU to act in the social and economic arena. The Maastricht treaty formed the new European Union, and added two further "pillars". These are a common foreign and security policy and justice and home affairs. In both these fields a consensus among member states is needed to act. <ref name="Europa Treaties">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=European treaties|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=2005|url=http://europa.eu/abc/treaties/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref>

{{main|Economy of the European Union}}

Taken as a single entity, the European Union has the largest economy in the world, with an estimated nominal GDP of €11.6 ($14.5) trillion in 2006 accounting for 35% of world GDP (the second largest economy is the [[USA]], with a GDP of $13.2 trillion). The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] has projected that in 2007 the [[Eurozone]] will take over from the [[USA|US]] as the driver of world economic growth with its 2.7% GDP growth compared to 2.1 percent in the US.<ref>[http://euobserver.com/9/24129 Eurozone outracing US on economic growth] EUobserver.com</ref> In 2006, the EU claimed it is estimated 3.5 million jobs were created in the [[Eurozone]]. [[Germany]], the largest economy within the EU, grew 2.7% in 2006 and is expected to grow at around 2.8% in 2007. After growing almost 3% as a whole in 2006 the EU economy is predicted to stay robust well into 2008 with average growth over those two years averaging over 2.5% growth. Many economists agree the EU has attained the capacity for higher growth than historically due to the EU's new member states potential to expand at a higher rate than traditional industrial powers of Europe. 

There are great national and intra-national economic disparities across the European Union, reflecting the different economies of its member states. Even corrected for purchasing power, there is a 12-fold difference between the richest [[NUTS-2]] & [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|3]] regions, [[Frankfurt]] (€68,751 [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]] per capita),<ref name="Frankfurt_Paris">{{cite web| url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/extraction/evalight/EVAlight.jsp?A=1&language=en&root=/theme1/regio/econ-r/esa95/gdp95/e3gdp95| title=Table:  E3GDP95 =  Gross domestic product (GDP) at current market prices at NUTS level 3

[[Image:Euro banknotes.png|thumb|200px|left|The [[euro]] is adopted by 13 countries and is used by 315 million people.]]
Differences between member states are also significant. GDP per capita is often 10% to 25% higher than the EU average in the "older" western member states, but only comprises one-third to two-thirds of the EU average in most eastern member states, as well as in potential membership candidates such as Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Turkey. By comparison, United States GDP per capita is 35% higher than the EU average: Japanese GDP per capita is approximately 15% higher.<ref>[[Eurostat]] News release166/2006,18 December 2006. ''GDP per capita in purchasing power standards. GDP per capita in the Member States ranged from 48% to 251% of the EU25 average in 2005.''</ref>

The European Union is the largest [[export]]er in the world and the second largest importer.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2078rank.html CIA rankorder], CIA Worldfactbook,  Accessed [[May 27]], [[2007]]</ref>
Internal trade between the member states is aided by the removal of barriers to trade such as [[tariff]]s and [[border control]]s. In the [[eurozone]], trade is aided by adoption of an uniform currency. The [[European Union Association Agreement]] extends such similar economic policies to a much larger range of countries, partly as a so-called soft approach ('a carrot instead of a stick') to influence the politics in those countries.

===Infrastructure===
[[Image:Windkraftanlagen Dänemark.jpg|thumb|right|200px| Wind turbines in [[Denmark]]]]
{{see also|Energy policy of the European Union|Renewable energy in the European Union}}

The EU has a policy to improve cross-border [[infrastructure]], see [[Trans-European Networks]].
The European Union has legislated in the area of energy policy for many years, and evolved out of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]]. The concept of introducing a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the [[European Council]] on [[October 27]] [[2005]] in [[London]].

The EU currently imports 82% of its [[petroleum|oil]] and 57% of its [[natural gas|gas]], making it the world's leading importer of these fuels.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16560106/ 'Low-carbon economy' proposed for Europe], www.msnbc.msn.com . Accessed [[January 24]], [[2007]]</ref>

The EU has enacted a series of directives concerning waste water treatment, drinking water and water resources management that have a profound impact on water and sanitation infrastructure investments in EU member countries (see [[EU water policy]]). In particular the waste water directive is considered by the European Commission the most cost intensive European legislation in the environmental sector.

The EU directives related to [[waste management]], such as the [[Landfill Directive]] and [[Waste Incineration Directive]] have also had a significant effect on practices in its member states. These relate to the improved use of resources by improving waste treatment according to the [[waste hierarchy]], reducing [[landfill]]ing of [[biodegradable waste]] and increasing [[recycling]] rates.

Member states have legally bound the EU to use 20 percent [[renewable energy]] and cut [[carbon dioxide]] [[Greenhouse gas|emissions]] by at least 20 percent from 1990 levels, by 2020.<ref>[http://euobserver.com/9/23665 EU sticks out neck in global climate change battle], EUobserver, Accessed [[9 March]], [[2007]]</ref> Within the same year, one-tenth of all cars and trucks in [[Treaty of Accession 2005|EU 27]] shall be running on [[biofuel]]s made from plants.

{{main|Demographics of the European Union}}

The population of the European Union is that of its [[Member states of the European Union|member states]], and changes with each accession (or, more rarely, secession). Each change in membership also affects demographic averages such as [[life expectancy]] and [[fertility rate]]. The total population of all member countries is approximately 494 million inhabitants [[as of 2007|as of January 2007]].<ref name=Area.and.population.figure>Figure including the four [[overseas department|French overseas departments]] ([[French Guiana]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[Réunion]]) which are an integral part of the European Union, but excluding the [[Overseas collectivity|French overseas collectivities]] and [[Overseas territory (France)|territories]], which are not part of the European Union.</ref> Expected short-term accessions (Croatia) will not substantially increase this figure. Growth in the short term is coming from net migration, since deaths outnumbered births in 2006 . At 1.52, the EU has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, well below the level required for [[Sub-replacement fertility|replacement]]. After 2025 , this negative [[natural increase]] will probably exceed net immigration, and (discounting new accessions) population is expected to decline gradually.<ref name="EU25populationprojection">{{PDFlink|[http://intranet.icea.es/pensiones/documentacion/Proy_demog_2004_2050.pdf EU25 population projection]|48.9&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 50174 bytes -->}}, Accessed [[January 24]], [[2007]]</ref>

{{further|[[Religion in Europe]]}}

The EU is officially a secular institution, hence neither God, nor Christianity was mentioned in its proposed constitution, in spite of pressure from churches. Most of the member states are secular states, although a small minority are not (the United Kingdom, Denmark, Greece and Finland) and others have references to Christianity in their own constitutions while officially remaining secular (e.g. the Irish Republic). Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel has promised the Pope that she will use her influence during Germany's EU presidency to try to include a reference to Christianity and God in a revived constitution.  However, this has provoked opposition, not least in the German press.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5337166.stm God and the EU Constitution, in European press review]</ref>

A significant religious diversity exists among the populations of EU member states, reflecting their diverse history and culture. Nowadays, religion is on the decline in Europe, and not all populations have religious majorities. In the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Estonia]], for example, a majority has no religious affiliation. The most common belief in the EU is [[Christianity]], which can be roughly divided into [[Roman Catholicism]], a wide range of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]. The Christian churches have historically wielded much power in Europe.  As a reaction during the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]], [[secularism]] was developed as a political system, allowing for a rise in [[atheism]] and [[agnosticism]].

[[Judaism]] has had a long history in Europe. [[As of 2002]], the European Union had an estimated [[Jewish population]] of something over a million, including about 519,000 in France and about 273,500 in the [[United Kingdom]]. This compares with about 5 million Jews in [[Israel]].<ref>Jewish population figures may be unreliable. These estimates are taken from {{cite web

Member states of the EU are, along with other European nations and several international NGOs, signatories to  the [[Bologna process]].  This is an attempt to create a [[European higher education area]], by making [[academic degree]] standards and quality assurance standards more comparable and compatible throughout [[Europe]]. It is named after the place it was proposed, the [[University of Bologna]] with the signing, in 1999, of the [[Bologna declaration]] by ministers of education from 29 European countries in the Italian city of [[Bologna]]. Governmental meetings have been held in [[Prague]] (2001), [[Berlin]] (2003), [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] (2005) and [[London]] (2007).

The [[Galileo positioning system]] (or simply 'Galileo'), is a proposed [[Global Navigation Satellite System]], to be built by the European Union and launched by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA).
The current project plan has the system as operational by 2010. Several other nations are joining the
project co financing the development such as China, Israel, India, Morocco or South Korea. ESA is a non-EU organisation and its membership includes non-EU countries such as [[Switzerland]] and [[Norway]] (although both countries are within the [[EFTA]], and are within [[Europe]]). There are ties between those organisations, with various agreements in place and being worked on, to establish the legal status of ESA with regard to the EU.<ref>ESA information on its relationship to the EU. [http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMFEPYV1SD_index_0.html]</ref> There are common goals between ESA and the EU, and ESA has an EU liaison office in Brussels.

The EU is also sponsoring a large number of research projects aimed at academics and institutes, organised in frameworks of calls. From 2007 the EU has opened its 7th framework for grant applications.

==Culture==
[[Image:Sibiuphoto.jpg|thumb|right|200px|One of the [[European Capital of Culture|European Capitals of Culture]] in 2007 - [[Sibiu]], [[Romania]]]]
{{main|Cultural policies of the European Union}}

Supporters of [[European integration]] often appeal to a European historical narrative, typically including [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]], the [[feudalism]] of the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Renaissance]], the [[Age of Enlightenment]], 19th century [[Liberalism]] and (sometimes) negative elements such as the [[World Wars]]. This history is assumed to be the source of European values. The status of [[Christianity]] as 'European heritage' is controversial, and has consequences for the [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]]. The [[European Convention]] rejected inclusion of a reference in the proposed [[European Constitution]] to Christianity and/or God. The text finally adopted in the [[wikisource:Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe: Preamble|Preamble]] reads:

:''DRAWING INSPIRATION from the cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe, from which have developed the universal values of the inviolable and inalienable rights of the human person, freedom, democracy, equality and the rule of law,...''

Attitudes and values of the EU population are very diverse, influenced by [[social class]], religion, level of education, and [[ethnicity]], and they are not necessarily either European or national in character. The interests of member [[state]]s are mainly economic and political in nature.

[[Image:Luxembourg0080.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The cultural capitals are designated for a period of one year ([[Luxembourg]])]]

There is no single culture or lifestyle common to the entire EU population. Some are local, national or regional. There are aspects of popular culture which can be found all over the EU, such as [[Football (soccer)|football]], but none are limited to the EU (they may be equally influential in non-member states in Europe, and some are global).

Cultural cooperation  ''between'' member states has become a community competency since its inclusion in 1992 in the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. Actions taken in the cultural area by the European Union include the [[Culture 2000]] 7-year programme, the [[European Capital of Culture]] programme, the [[European Cultural Month]] event, the [[Media Plus]] programme, experimental actions and the awarding of various grants.

The European Union gave grants to 233 cultural projects in 2004 and launched a webportal dedicated to Europe and Culture, responding to the [[European Council]]'s expressed desire to see the [[European Commission|Commission]] and the member states "promote the networking of cultural information to enable all citizens to access European cultural content by the most advanced technological means."

===Sport===
[[Image:Campnoumatch.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Football (soccer)|Football]] is the most popular sport in the EU ([[:en:Nou Camp|Camp Nou]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]])]]
{{main|Sport policies of the European Union}}

Sports, including [[spectator sports]], are popular in EU countries, the most popular being [[Football (soccer)|football]]. [[Cycling]], [[golf]], and [[tennis]] are also widely watched and played in the EU. Other sports are favourites in fewer countries, such as [[basketball]], [[ice hockey]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[team handball|handball]], and [[motorsports]]; and several sports are only played to a significant extent in one or a few countries (e.g. [[cricket]] in England, [[hurling]], [[Gaelic handball]] and [[Gaelic football]] in Ireland, and [[korfball]] in the Netherlands and Belgium).

Although it recently launched an anti-doping convention, the European Union plays a minor and mostly indirect role in sport policy. Sports are normally considered to be outside the [[principle of conferral|competences conferred]] by the member states to the European Union. Sports are also organised nationally, on a European continental level (which is not the same as the level of the European Union), or globally. The European Union does not have specific sports policies. The role of the EU could increase in the future, if (for example) the [[Reform Treaty]] were to be ratified by all member states.

Yet other policies of the EU can have an impact on sports, as famously exemplified by the [[Bosman ruling]], which, among other things, prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players from other EU states. This ruling subsequently forced [[UEFA]] to modify the rules for all its European members. The Bosman ruling also gave all EU players the right of [[free transfer (football)|free transfer]] after expiration of their contracts.
