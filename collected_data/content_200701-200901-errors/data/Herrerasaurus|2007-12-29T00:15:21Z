'''''Herrerasaurus''''' (meaning "Herrera's lizard," after the name of the rancher who discovered the first [[fossil]] of the animal) was one of the earliest [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] [[dinosaur]]s. All known specimens have been discovered in northwest [[Patagonia]], [[Argentina]], in late [[Triassic]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] rocks (early [[Carnian]] [[faunal stage|stage]], around 228 [[mya (unit)|million years ago]]). The [[type species]], ''Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis'', was described by [[Osvaldo Reig]] in 1963<ref name="Reig1963"/> and is the only species assigned to the genus. 

For many years, the classification of ''Herrerasaurus'' was unclear, as the animal was initially known from very fragmentary remains; it has been [[hypothesis|hypothesized]] to be a [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] [[Theropoda|theropod]], a basal [[sauropodomorpha|sauropodomorph]], a basal [[saurischia]]n, or not a dinosaur. However, with the discovery of a mostly-complete skeleton and skull in 1988,<ref name ="Sereno1988">{{cite journal|last=Sereno|first=P.C. |coauthors=Novas, F.E.; Arcucci, A.B.; and C.

This medium-sized [[bipedalism|bipedal]] reptile is a member of the [[Herrerasaur]]idae, a group of similar animals which were among the earliest of the dinosaurian [[evolutionary radiation|radiation]].

==Description==
''Herrerasaurus'' was a lightly-built bipedal carnivore with a long tail and a relatively small head. Its length is estimated at 3 to 6&nbsp;[[metre|meters]] (10 to 20&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]);<ref name ="Sereno1992"/> its hip height at more than 1.1&nbsp;meters (3.3&nbsp;ft), and it may have weighed around 210–350&nbsp;[[kilogram]]s (463–772&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]).<ref name=GSP88>{{cite book|last=Paul |first=G.S. |year=1988 |title=Predatory Dinosaurs of the World |location=New York |publisher=Simon and Schuster |pages=248–250 }}</ref> In a large specimen at first thought to belong to a separate genus, ''Frenguellisaurus'',<ref name=GSP88/> its head measured 56&nbsp;[[centimetre|centimeters]] (1.8&nbsp;ft) in length.

===Skull===
[[Image:Herreramodel.jpg|thumb|left|A fossil reconstruction (left) and model (right) of ''Herrerasaurus'' stand side by side at Chicago's [[Field Museum of Natural History]].]]
''Herrerasaurus'' had a long, narrow [[skull]] that lacked nearly all the specializations that characterized later dinosaurs,<ref name="Sereno1993">{{cite journal|last=Sereno|first=P.C. |coauthors=and Novas, F.E. |year=1993 |title=The skull and neck of the basal theropod ''Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis'' |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=13 |pages=451–476}}</ref> being not that different from those of more primitive [[archosaur]]s such as ''[[Euparkeria]]''. It had five pairs of [[fenestrae]] (skull openings) in its skull, two of which were for ocular and nasal openings. Between the eyes and the nostrils were two [[antorbital fenestra]]e and a pair of tiny, 1-centimeter-long (0.4&nbsp;in) slit-like holes called promaxillary fenestrae.<ref name="Sereno07">{{cite journal |last=Sereno |first=P.C. |authorlink= |title=The phylogenetic relationships of early dinosaurs: a comparative report |journal=Historical Biology |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=145–155 |date=2007 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08912960601167435 |doi=10.1080/08912960601167435 |id=ISSN 0891-2963 |accessdate= }}</ref> Behind the eyes were large [[Skull#Temporal Fenestra|infratemporal fenestrae]]. These holes helped reduce the weight of the skull. 

''Herrerasaurus'' had a flexible joint in the lower jaw; this allowed the animal to slide its lower jaw back and forth and deliver a grasping bite.<ref name="Sereno1993"/> This cranial specialization is unusual among the dinosaurs but has evolved independently in some lizards.<ref name="McDowell1954">{{cite journal|last=McDowell|first=S.B., Jr.|coauthors=and C.M.

===Limbs===
''Herrerasaurus'' had relatively short forelimbs that were less than half the length of its hind limbs. The [[humerus]] and [[radius]] were rather short, while the [[manus (zoology)|manus]] was elongated. The first two fingers and the thumb bore curved, sharp claws for grasping prey.

===Derived and basal characteristics===
This dinosaur is an enigmatic creature, showing traits that are found in different groups of dinosaurs. Although it shared most of the characteristics of dinosaurs, there were a few differences, particularly in regard to the shape of its hip and leg bones. Its pelvis was similar to that of saurischian dinosaurs, but it had a bony [[acetabulum]] (where the [[femur]] meets the [[pelvis]]) that was only partially perforate.  The [[ilium (bone)|ilium]], the main hip bone, was supported only by two [[sacrum|sacrals]], a [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] trait,<ref name="Langer04"/> but the [[pubis (bone)|pubis]] pointed backwards, a [[derived]] trait that parallels what is seen in [[dromaeosaurid]]s and [[bird]]s. Also, the end of the pubis had a booted shape, similar to what is present in [[avetheropoda|avetheropods]], and the [[vertebra]]l [[vertebral body|centra]] had an ''[[Allosaurus]]''-like [[hourglass]] shape.<ref name=GSP88/>

==Classification==

==History==
''Herrerasaurus'' was named by [[paleontologist]] Osvaldo Reig after Victorino Herrera, an Andean [[goatherd]] who first noticed its [[fossil]]s in outcrops near the city of San Juan in 1959.<ref name="Reig1963"/> These rocks, which later yielded ''[[Eoraptor]]'',<ref name=Serenoetal1993>{{cite journal|last=Sereno|first=P.C.|coauthors=Forster, C.A.; Rogers, R.R.; and Monetta, A.M.|year=1993|title=Primitive dinosaur skeleton from Argentina and the early evolution of Dinosaurs|journal=Nature|volume=361|issue=6407|pages=64–66}}</ref> are part of the [[Ischigualasto|Ischigualasto Formation]] and date from the late [[Ladinian]] - early [[Carnian]] stages of the Late [[Triassic]] period.<ref name="Rogers93">{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=R.

Reig believed ''Herrerasaurus'' was an early example of a [[Carnosauria|carnosaur]],<ref name="Reig1963">{{cite journal|last=Reig|first=O.A.|year=1963|title=La presencia de dinosaurios saurisquios en los "Estratos de Ischigualasto" (Mesotriásico Superior) de las provincias de San Juan y La Rioja (República Argentina)|journal= Ameghiniana|volume=3|issue=1|pages=3–20}}</ref> but this was the subject of much debate over the next 30 years, and the genus was variously classified during that time.

A complete ''Herrerasaurus'' skull was not found until 1988, by a team of paleontologists led by [[Paul Sereno]].<ref name="Sereno1992"/><ref>{{cite episode|title=The Nature of the Beast |episodelink= |series=The Dinosaurs!|serieslink= |airdate=1990 |season= |number=3}}</ref> Based on the new fossils, authors such as [[Thomas R.

However, Sereno favored classifying ''Herrerasaurus'' (and the Herrerasauridae) as primitive theropods. These two classifications have become the most persistent, with Rauhut (2003)<ref name="Rauhut03">{{cite journal |last=Rauhut|first=O.W.M. |title=The interrelationships and evolution of basal theropod dinosaurs |journal=Special Papers in Palaeontology |volume=69 |pages=1–213 |publisher= |date=2003 }}</ref> and Bittencourt and Kellner (2004)<ref name="BittenKellner">{{cite journal| last =Bittencourt| first =J. |coauthors=and Kellner, W.A. |title=The phylogenetic position of ''Staurikosaurus pricei'' from the Triassic of Brazil |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=24 |issue=3, supplement |pages=39A |date=2004 |doi=}}</ref> favoring the early theropod [[hypothesis]], and Max Langer (2004),<ref name="Langer04"/> Langer and [[Michael J.

The importance of ''Herrerasaurus'' and ''Eoraptor'' lies in the fact that their remains allow for directly testing the idea of dinosaurs being a [[monophyly|monophyletic]] group, i.e. all dinosaurs have a common ancestor. The monophyly of dinosaurs was explicitly proposed in the 1970s by Bakker,<ref name="Bakker1974">{{cite journal|last=Bakker|first=R.T.|coauthors=and Galton, P.M.|title=Dinosaur monophyly and a new class of vertebrates |journal=Nature |volume=248 |pages=168–172 |doi=10.1038/248168a0 }}</ref><ref name="Bonaparte1976">{{cite journal|last=Bonaparte|first=J.

However, an extensive study of ''Herrerasaurus'' by Sereno indicates that only one cranial and seven postcranial synapomorphies in Bakker's original list are actually supported while  additional synapomorphies were discovered.<ref name="Sereno1992"/>

==Paleoecology==
Although ''Herrerasaurus'' shared the body shape of the large carnivorous dinosaurs, it lived about 230 [[million years ago]], a time when dinosaurs were small and insignificant. It was the time of non-dinosaurian reptiles, not dinosaurs, and a major turning point in the Earth's ecology. The vertebrate fauna of the Ischigualasto Formation and the slightly later [[Los Colorados Formation]] consisted mainly of a variety of [[crurotarsi|crurotarsal]] [[archosaur]]s and [[synapsids]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bonaparte|first=J.

Studies suggest that the [[natural environment|paleoenvironment]] of the Ischigualasto Formation was a volcanically active floodplain covered by forests and subject to strong seasonal rainfalls. Vegetation consisted of [[fern]]s (''[[Cladophlebis]]''), sphenopsids ([[horsetail]]s), and giant [[conifer]]s (''Protojuniperoxylon'').<ref name="Bonaparte1979"/>  The plants formed an [[upland (geology)|upland]] [[riparian zone|riparian]] forest.<ref name="Sereno1992"/> ''Herrerasaurus'' remains appear to have been the most common among the carnivores of the Ischigualasto Formation.<ref name = "Rogers93"/> It lived in the jungles of Late Triassic [[South America]] alongside another early dinosaur, ''[[Eoraptor]]'', as well as ''[[Saurosuchus]]'',<ref>{{cite journal|last = Sill|first=W.D.|year=1974 |title=The anatomy of ''Saurosuchus galilei'' and the relationships of the rauisuchid thecodonts |journal=Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology |volume=146 |pages=317–362 }}</ref> a giant land-living meat-eating [[rauisuchia]]n; ''[[Venaticosuchus]]'', an [[ornithosuchidae|ornithosuchid]]; and the predatory [[chiniquodontidae|chiniquodontid]] [[cynodont]]s.<ref name = "Rogers93"/> Herbivores were much more abundant than carnivores and were represented by  [[rhynchosaur]]s such as ''[[Hyperodapedon]]'' (formerly ''[[Scaphonyx]]''); [[aetosaur]]s; [[kannemeyeriidae|kannemeyeriid]] [[dicynodont]]s such as ''[[Ischigualastia]]'',  and [[traversodontidae|traversodontid]]s such as ''[[Exaeretodon]]''. These non-dinosaurian herbivores were much more abundant than early ornithischian dinosaurs like ''[[Pisanosaurus]]'' <ref>{{cite journal |last=Bonaparte |first=J.F. |year=1970 |title=Annotated list of the South American Triassic tetrapods |journal=Gondwana Symposium Proceedings and Papers |volume=2 |pages=665–682}}</ref> and therefore more likely prey for ''Herrerasaurus'' than were the early dinosaurs.

==Paleobiology==
The teeth of ''Herrerasaurus'' indicate it was a [[carnivore]]; its size indicates it would have preyed upon small and medium-sized animals. It may have fed on other dinosaurs, such as the [[herbivore|herbivorous]] ''Pisanosaurus''. However, since ''Herrerasaurus'' lived during an era when other dinosaurs were uncommon, more plentiful prey would have included [[rhynchosaur]]s and [[aetosaur]]s. ''Herrerasaurus'' itself may have been preyed upon by giant [[rauisuchia|rauisuchid]]s like ''[[Saurosuchus]]'', as puncture wounds were found in one skull.<ref name="Sereno1993"/>

[[Coprolite]]s (fossilized dung) containing small bones but no trace of plant fragments, discovered in the Ischigualasto Formation, have been assigned to ''Herrerasaurus'' based on fossil abundance.  The mineralogical and chemical analysis of these coprolites indicate that the carnivorous animal had the ability to digest bones.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hollocher |first=K.T. |coauthors=Alcober, O.A.; Colombi, C.E.; and Hollocher, T.C. |title=Carnivore coprolites from the Upper Triassic Ischigualasto Formation, Argentina: chemistry, mineralogy, and evidence for rapid initial mineralization |journal=PALAIOS |year=2005 |volume=20 |pages=51–63 }}</ref> <!--Similar studies made on coprolites assigned to a large Cretaceous theropod (most probably ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'') and concluding to the ability of dinosaurs to dissolve ingested bones, further strengthen the assertion.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Chin | first =K. |coauthors = Tokaryk, T.T., Erickson, G.M., and Calk, L.C. | year = 1998 | title =A king-sized theropod coprolite| journal = Nature | volume = 393 | pages = 680–682}} </ref> Karen's paper said the opposite, that they were passing the bones quickly without digestion-->
