John was transferred to reserve battalions, and in August 1917 he ended up with the Boys' Battalion (also known as the "Young Soldiers' Battalion"), waiting until he was old enough to go to the frontlines. But before he could leave for the front, the war ended.

Babcock emigrated to the [[United States|US]] in the [[1920s]], becoming a naturalized American citizen in 1924.
