'''Italian Mare Nostrum''' was the name given, during [[World War II]], by [[Benito Mussolini]] and his [[Italian fascism|fascist]] propaganda to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] under the domination of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861â€“1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], mainly in 1942.

==The Mare Nostrum of Mussolini==
The Mediterranean was called ''[[Mare Nostrum]]'' (in [[English language|English]]: "Our Sea") during the centuries of the [[Roman Empire]], an empire that fascism intended to recreate after the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|conquest of Ethiopia]] in 1936.

Mussolini wanted to re-establish the greatness of the Roman Empire and believed that Italy was the most powerful of the Mediterranean countries after [[World War I]]. He declared that "the [[20th century|twentieth century]] will be a century of Italian power" and created one of the most powerful naval powers of the world in order to control the Mediterranean Sea <ref>Fleming, Thomas. ''The New Dealers' War''. Perseus Books,2001</ref>.

However, the nation that effectively dominated the Mediterranean was the [[United Kingdom]], as the British had strong naval bases in [[Gibraltar]], [[Malta]] and [[Cyprus]]. The British also controlled the [[Suez Canal]], along with the French; the [[French Third Republic]] had a relatively powerful navy, and controlled the African [[Maghreb]].

When [[Battle of France|France collapsed]] in 1940, Mussolini started to expand the Italian maritime control on the central Mediterranean, attacking British possessions. The ensuing [[Battle of the Mediterranean]] had many changes of fortune and finished with the victory of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].

There were a series of surface actions (e.g., [[Battle of Cape Matapan]], [[Battle of Punta Stilo]], [[Battle of Cape Teulada]], [[Second Battle of Sirte]], [[Battle of Mid-June]], [[Battle of Mid-August]]) between Allied navies and the Italian [[Regia Marina]], during which the British, able to replace losses with warships redeployed from other theatres, finally gained the upper hand.

The Italian Navy's most successful attack, however, was when [[human torpedo]] divers planted mines on British battleships in [[Alexandria]] ([[Egypt]]) harbour (19 December 1941), and the [[HMS Queen Elizabeth (00)|HMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']] and [[HMS Valiant (1914)|HMS ''Valiant'']] were sunk. After these sinkings (and the contemporary destruction of the British [[Force K]]), the Italian Navy obtained for some months the nearly complete control of the central Mediterranean<ref>Blitzer, Wolf. ''Century of War''. Friedman/Fairfax Publishers,2001</ref>.  In this way the Regia Marina was able to deliver the military supply and oil for the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] victory of [[Tobruk]] and for the advance toward [[El Alamein]] in Egypt.

In summer/autumn 1942 Italy controlled the European seashores of the Mediterranean from the [[Rhone]] river in occupied France to [[Mount Olympus]] in Aegean [[Greece]]. A similar situation happened in the African shores of the Mediterranean Sea, where Mussolini's control went from [[Tunisia]] to [[El Alamein]] in [[Egypt]]. This Italian domination was increased by the fact that most of the remaing shores of the Mediterranean were controlled by the fascist [[Spain]] of [[Franco]], the [[France]] of [[Vichy]] and the [[Turkey]] of [[Kemal Ataturk]], all of them with friendliness toward [[Mussolini]].

In those months Mussolini referred to the Mediterranean Sea as ''Mare Nostrum''<ref>Lamb, Richard.  ''Mussolini as Diplomat''. Fromm Ed.,1999</ref>, in the same manner as the Romans had done when they dominated the Classical World.  However, the Roman Mare Nostrum lasted for roughly six hundred years, while Mussolini's Mare Nostrum lasted a few years until the [[Italian armistice]] in September 1943.

All the overseas possessions of Italy in the Mediterranean Sea ([[Dodecanese]], [[Libya]], [[Saseno]] island, etc.) were lost formally as a result of the [[Treaty of peace with Italy (1947)]].
