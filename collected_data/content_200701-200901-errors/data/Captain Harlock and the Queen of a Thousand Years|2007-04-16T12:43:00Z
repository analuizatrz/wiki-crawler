'''''Captain Harlock and the Queen of a Thousand Years''''' was an [[animated]] [[science fiction]] [[television series]] produced by [[Harmony Gold USA]]. The series was created by [[Carl Macek]] in a similar fashion as ''[[Robotech]]'' by combining two unrelated ''[[animé]]'' series, ''[[Captain Harlock]]'' and ''[[Queen Millennia]]'', together and reworking their plots and dialogue in order to create an entirely new story for American audiences.

==Background==
After their initial success with ''Robotech'', Harmony Gold sought to expand their [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] television production in other animation series originating in [[Japan]]. Carl Macek, who produced ''Robotech'', was asked what other ''animé'' series he was interested in dubbing. Macek wanted to dub and localize [[Leiji Matsumoto]]'s series ''Captain Harlock''.

According to Macek, he was then informed a few days later that the rights had been obtained, and he needed to produce 65 episodes.<ref>http://www.cornponeflicks.org/harlock/harlock1000.html</ref> Unfortunately, ''Captain Harlock'' was only 42 episodes long, prompting Harmony Gold to buy another Matsumoto series, ''Queen Millennia''. It then fell to Macek and his team to combine the two shows into one series.

==Production History==
Unlike ''Robotech'', it was decided to combine the two series simultaneously instead of simply running them one after the other with some "connecting" episodes. At the same time, it was also decided to change the timing of episodes, thus creating a situation where clips from episodes at various points in the original series would appear in a single episode in the American series. This resulted in a wildly different plot from both of the original sources.

The new story finds the universe of 2976 as a corrupt and decadent place. Humanity has reached the stars, but has stagnated in progress and morality. It is in this enivronment that a race of sentient [[plants]] known as the Zetons hatch a plot under their queen, Lafresia, to seize Earth after their own planet becomes completely uninhabitable. A lone scientist realizes this and tries to warn Earth, but is laughed off and soon murdered by Zeton agents. Captain Harlock, a friend of the scientist, is framed for the crime and must go on the run. Despite the fact that he has become an outcast, however, Harlock plans to stop the Zeton plot and save humanity, at least from its external enemies. In this endeavor, he joins forces with another captain named Millennia.

==DVD Release==
As of January 2007 this series has had no home release, on [[DVD]] or [[VHS]].
