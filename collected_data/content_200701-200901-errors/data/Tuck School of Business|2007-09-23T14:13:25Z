The '''Amos Tuck School of Business Administration''' is the [[business school]] of [[Dartmouth College]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]]. Founded in [[1900]], Tuck is one of the oldest graduate school of business in the world. Since 2000, it has branded itself the '''Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth'''. It is widely considered one of the top institutions for business education in the world. It is one of six [[Ivy League business schools]].

Tuck offers only one degree program, the [[Master of Business Administration]], alongside shorter programs for executives and recent college graduates. It co-operates with a Master of Engineering Management offered by Dartmouth's [[Thayer School of Engineering]] and also offers a number of dual degrees, including a joint MD/MBA in conjunction with the [[Dartmouth Medical School]], an MSEL/MBA with the [[Vermont Law School]] and a MALD/MBA with [[The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]].

==History==

The school was established by [[Edward Tuck]], and was originally named the [[Amos Tuck]] School of Administration and Finance (in memory of his father). In [[1941]], the official name was changed to the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration.

Tuck initially donated $300,000 in the form of 1,700 [[shares]] of [[preferred stock]] in the [[Great Northern Railway Company of Minnesota]]. He later gave $100,000 to build the first Tuck Hall (now [[McNutt Hall]]) in [[1901]], and over $500,000 for the current Tuck Hall complex in [[1929]].

==Ranking and reputation==
[[Image:TuckSchoolofBusiness.jpg|thumb|290px|right|The Tuck School's main entrance.]]
Tuck consistently ranks in the top 10 in all the major business school rankings. The [[MBA]] program at the Tuck School has been ranked first for several years by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and is also currently ranked first by [[Forbes]]. Tuck has consistently been ranked among the top ten business schools in the world by ''[[BusinessWeek]]'', ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'', and the ''[[Financial Times]]''. Tuck, [[Wharton School of Business]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and the [[Columbia Business School]] are the only US business schools currently ranked in the top ten of each of these five major publications.  These five publications are the main ranking systems in which the top business school programs participate. Tuck places #1 when these rankings are averaged.<ref>http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/news/releases/pr20070917_wsj.html</ref>

The Tuck School has also been ranked first several times by ''[[the Economist]]'''s sister publication, the Economist Intelligence Unit, in its rankings.  Many leading business schools in other countries have exchange programs with Tuck, including the [[Handelshochschule Leipzig (HHL)]], the [[HEC School of Management]], [[IESE]] and [[London Business School]].

==Alumni Giving==
Percentage-wise, Tuck claims the highest Alumni donation record of any business school in the world.<ref name="Tuck Alumni Giving">{{cite news | last = Keating | first = Kim | title = World record: two of every three Tuck alumni give back | work = [[Tuck School News]] | date = [[2007-07-05]] | url = http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/news/releases/pr20070705_alumni.html | accessdate = 2007-07-09 }}</ref> It is the only business school in BusinessWeek's study of US business schools to have at least 50% of its alumni contribute to their ''alma mater'''s annual funds, with 66% making donations.<ref name="Tuck Alumni Giving">{{cite news | last = Keating | first = Kim | title = World record: two of every three Tuck alumni give back | work = [[Tuck School News]] | date = [[2007-07-05]] | url = http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/news/releases/pr20070705_alumni.html | accessdate = 2007-07-09 }}</ref>  At most top B-schools, about 60% of the "annual fund" (which pays for expenses not traditionally covered by the [[financial endowment]]) comes from alumni donations, with the balance coming from wealthy non-alumni donors.  At Tuck, however, 86% of the fund is the result of alumni giving.  In 2007, Tuck announced that 100% of the graduating class contributed towards their class gift.<ref name="Tuck Alumni Giving">{{cite news | last = Keating | first = Kim | title = World record: two of every three Tuck alumni give back | work = [[Tuck School News]] | date = [[2007-07-05]] | url = http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/news/releases/pr20070705_alumni.html | accessdate = 2007-07-09 }}</ref>
