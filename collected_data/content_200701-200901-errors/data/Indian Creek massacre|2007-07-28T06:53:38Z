The '''Indian Creek massacre''' occurred on [[May 20]], [[1832]] when a group of settlers living six miles north of [[Ottawa, Illinois|Ottawa]], [[Illinois]], along the Indian Creek, were attacked by a raiding party of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Fifteen settlers, including women and children, were massacred at the site in present-day [[DeKalb County]].

== Background ==
The attack may gave been spurred by the recent provocations of a Kentuckian settler named William Davis.{{fact|date=July 2007}} Davis was a blacksmith and a mill operator and had dammed [[Indian Creek (Illinois)|Indian Creek]], a vital source of food to a nearby Indian village, as well as committing other transgressions on them.

At the same time, the [[Black Hawk War]] had recently erupted in Illinois. The [[Battle of Stillman's Run]], fought on [[May 14]], [[1832]] proved to be a victory for [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]]'s band over the Illinois Militia. This event may have encouraged the assault at Indian Creek.{{fact|date=July 2007}}

== Massacre ==
After the battle at Stillman's Run, rumors of an attack on white settlers became widespread. The settlement at the Indian Creek had ample cause to evacuate, but William Davis, among others, convinced the inhabitants to stay.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}   

Around forty Indians attacked the settlement on the afternoon of [[May 20]]. Most of the men, working in the fields, fled, leaving the women and children to fend for themselves.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} The cabins were stormed and the inhabitants killed. Two young women, [[Rachel Hall|Rachel]] and [[Sylvia Hall]], were taken prisoner and later released on [[June 2]].{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

It is believed that [[Potawatomi]] Indians, along with three [[Sauk]] Indians, were responsible.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} There is no evidence that Black Hawk sanctioned the massacre; however, he had some alliance with the Potawatomi.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} The prisoners ended up in the care of the [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]]s until ransomed.

== Aftermath ==
The killings triggered mass hysteria in the white population nearby. People abandoned settlements and sought refuge inside military forts, such as [[Fort Dearborn]] in [[Chicago]].

As a result, the Illinois Militia, along with Federal troops, redoubled its efforts, continuing the relentless pursuit of Black Hawk's band. The war would end at the [[Battle of Bad Axe]] and the massacre of three hundred Indians.

After the war, three Potawatomi were charged with committing murder during the Indian Creek massacre, but since witnesses failed to identify them as participants, they were released.
