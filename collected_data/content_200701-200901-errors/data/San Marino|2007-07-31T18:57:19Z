The '''Most Serene Republic of San Marino''' ({{lang-it|Serenissima Repubblica di San Marino}}) is a country in the [[Apennine Mountains]]. It is a [[landlocked country|landlocked]] [[Enclave and exclave|enclave]], completely surrounded by [[Italy]]. One of the [[European microstates]], San Marino has the smallest population of all the members of the [[Council of Europe]].

According to tradition, San Marino is the oldest constitutional [[republic]] in the world still existing: it was founded in the year [[301]] by [[Saint Marinus|Marinus]] of [[Rab]], a [[Christian]] [[Stonemasonry|stonemason]] fleeing the [[Persecution of the early Christians|religious persecution]] of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]]. San Marino has the oldest written constitution still in effect, dating back to 1600.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/law/guide/sanmarino.html|accessdate=2007-03-29|title=Guide to Law Online: San Marino|author=Law Library of United States Congress}}</ref>

==History==  
{{main|History of San Marino}}
According to tradition, Marino left the Adriatic island of [[Rab]] (Italian: ''Arbe'') with his lifelong friend Leo and went to the town of [[Rimini]] as a stone worker. After persecution because of his Christian sermons, he escaped to the nearby [[Monte Titano]], where he built a small church and thus founded what is now the city and the state of San Marino. The official date of foundation of the Republic is [[3 September]] [[301]].

By the mid-5th century, a community was formed; because of its relatively inaccessible location and its poverty, it has succeeded, with a few brief interruptions, in maintaining its independence. In 1631 its independence was recognized by the papacy.

During the early phase of the Italian unification process of the 19th century, San Marino served as a haven of refuge for numerous persons who were persecuted because of their support for [[Italian unification]]. In memory of this support, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] accepted the wish of San Marino not to be incorporated into the new Italian state. [[Napoleon]] refused to take the country. He commented, "Why, it's a model republic!"

The government of San Marino made [[Abraham Lincoln]] an honorary citizen.  He wrote in reply, saying that the republic proved that "government founded on republican principles is capable of being so administered as to be secure and enduring." (Source: [[Irving Wallace]], ''The Book of Lists 3)''

During [[World War II]] San Marino was able to officially remain neutral. [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis forces]] retreated through the country and were pursued by the American and British forces. The [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops left the country a few weeks later. 

The [[head of state]] is a committee (council) of two captains-regent. San Marino also holds the record for the world's first democratically-elected [[Communism|communist]] government, which held office between [[1945]] and [[1957]].

San Marino was the world's smallest republic from [[301]] to [[1968]], until [[Nauru]] gained independence.

San Marino became a member of the [[Council of Europe]] in 1988 and of the [[United Nations]] in 1992. It is not a member of the [[European Union]].

== Politics ==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{main|Politics of San Marino}}

The ''Consiglio Grande e Generale'' ("[[Grand and General Council]]") is elected by popular vote every five years. This [[parliament]] selects two of its members to serve as ''Capitani Reggenti'' ("Captains Regent") for periods of six months. The ''Capitani Reggenti'' and the cabinet form the [[executive branch]] of the government.

The Council also elects the ''Consiglio dei XII'' (Council of Twelve), which forms the [[judicial branch]] during the period of legislature of the Council.

== Municipalities ==
[[Image:San Marino.png|thumb|280px|[[Subnational|Administrative division]].]]
San Marino is divided into the following nine municipalities, known locally as ''castelli'' or ''castles'' (sing. ''castello'', each on a different hill, as depicted on the republic's coat of arms), that are also towns to the world. 

*[[San Marino, San Marino|The City of San Marino]] (''Città di San Marino'') is the eponymous capital. There are also eight minor municipalities: 
*[[Acquaviva, San Marino|Acquaviva]]
*[[Borgo Maggiore]]
*[[Chiesanuova]]
*[[Domagnano]]
*[[Faetano]]
*[[Fiorentino]]
*[[Montegiardino]]
*[[Serravalle, San Marino|Serravalle]]
:*The largest town of the Republic is [[Dogana]], which is not an autonomous castello but rather belongs to the castello of Serravalle.

Each castello, like Italian [[comune|''comuni'']], includes a main town that is the seat of the castello, called ''capoluogo'', and some even smaller localities known as ''[[frazione|frazioni]]''.

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of San Marino}}[[Image:San-Marino-vista-1282.JPG|thumb|right|280px|Much of the Republic can be seen from the top of Mount Titano]]
San Marino is an [[enclave]] in Italy, on the border between the [[Regions of Italy|''regioni'']] of [[Emilia Romagna]] and [[Marche]]. Its topography is dominated by the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] mountain range, and it has a rugged terrain. The highest point in the country, [[Monte Titano]], is situated at 749&nbsp;metres (2,457&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) above sea level. There are no bodies of water of any significant size.

The [[climate]] is [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]], with warm summers and mild winters.

San Marino is the third-smallest country in Europe, with only [[Vatican City]] and [[Monaco]] being smaller.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of San Marino}}

Although San Marino is not an official [[European Union]] member, it is allowed to use the [[euro]] as its [[currency]] by virtue of arrangements with the council of the [[European Union]]; it is also granted the right to use its own designs on the national side of the [[euro coins]]. Before the Euro, the [[Sammarinese lira]] was coupled to and exchangeable with the [[Italian lira]]. The small number of Sammarinese euro coins, as was the case with the lira before it, are primarily of interest to [[coin collecting|coin collectors]].

The [[tourism|tourist]] sector contributes over 50% of San Marino's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], with more than 3.3 million tourists visiting in [[1997]]. Other key [[industry|industries]] are [[bank]]ing, [[electronics]], and [[ceramic]]s. The main [[agriculture|agricultural]] products are [[wine]] and [[cheese]].

San Marino's [[postage stamp]]s, which are only valid for mail posted within the country, are mostly sold to [[philately|philatelists]] and also form a source of income. San Marino is a member of the [[Small European Postal Administration Cooperation]].

The per capita level of output and standard of living are comparable to those of Italy, which supplies much of its food.

===Taxation===

The corporate profits tax rate in San Marino is 19 percent. Capital gains are subject to a five percent tax; interest is subject to a 13 percent withholding tax. 

In 1972, a valued added taxation (VAT) system was introduced in Italy, and was applied in San Marino, in accordance with the 1939 friendship treaty. In addition, a tax on imported goods, to be levied by San Marino, was established. Such taxes, however, were not, and are not, applied to national products. Until 1996, goods manufactured and sold in San Marino were not subject to indirect taxation.

Under the European Union customs agreement, San Marino continues to levy taxes, the equivalent of an import duty, on imported goods. Also, a general VAT was introduced, in replacement of the Italian VAT.

== Transport ==
{{Main|Transport in San Marino}}
San Marino's closest airport, located in Italy, is [[Federico Fellini International Airport]] close to the city of [[Rimini]].

Please see the main article for other forms of transport, current and historical.

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Demographics of San Marino}}
There is no significant difference between the demographics of San Marino and Italy. 

The state has a population of approximately 29,000, including 1,000 foreigners, most of whom are Italians.  About 5,000 Sammarinese live in foreign countries, predominantly in Italy.

The language spoken is [[Italian language|Italian]], with the [[Emiliano-Romagnolo]] dialect, and [[Roman Catholicism]] is the predominant religion. {{see|Demographics of Italy}}

[[Image:Sanmarino5.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Guaita]]
== Culture ==
The [[Three Towers of San Marino]]  are located on the three peaks of [[Monte Titano]] in the capital. They are depicted on both the [[Flag of San Marino ]] and its [[Coat of Arms of San Marino|coat of arms]]. The three towers are Guaita, the oldest of the three — it was constructed in the eleventh century— the  thirteenth-century Cesta, located on the highest of Monte Titano's summits. and the fourteenth-century Montale, on the smallest of Monte Titano's summits, still privately owned.

San Marino also has a cake known as La Torta Di Tre Monti ("Cake of the Three Mountains/Towers"), similar to a layered wafer cake covered in [[Chocolate]].
