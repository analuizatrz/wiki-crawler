'''''Le Corsaire''''' ('''''The Pirate''''') is a [[ballet|Grand ballet]] in three acts, with a libretto by [[Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges]] derived from the poem ''[[The Corsair]]'' by [[Lord Byron]]. Originally choreographed by [[Joseph Mazilier]] to the music of [[Adolphe Adam]]. First presented by the [[Académie Royale de Musique|Ballet du Théâtre Impérial de l´Opéra]] in [[Paris]] on [[23 January]] [[1856]].

The ballet has many celebrated passages which are often extracted and performed independently &mdash; the ''[[Grand ballabile]]'' known as ''Le Jardin Animé''; the ''[[Pas d'action]]'' known as the ''Pas d'Esclave''; and the classical ''[[pas]]'' for three soloist Ballerinas known as the ''Grand Pas de trois des Odalisques''. The most celebrated excerpt is the so-called ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'', which is among classical ballet's most iconic and performed excerpts.

''Le Corsaire'' has been much revised throughout its long and complex performance history. All productions staged throughout world are derived from the many revivals staged by the Ballet Master [[Marius Petipa]] for the [[Imperial Ballet]]. Among the most notable stagings of ''Le Corsaire'' since its original inception &mdash; [[Jules Perrot]] (for the Imperial Ballet -1858); [[Marius Petipa]] (for the Imperial Ballet -1858, 1863, 1868, 1885, and 1899); [[Alexander Gorsky]] (for the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre -1912); [[Samuil Andrianov]] (for the Imperial Ballet -1915); [[Agrippina Vaganova]] (for the Kirov Ballet -1931); [[Pyotr Gusev]] (for the Leningrad Maly Theatre -1955); [[Konstantin Sergeyev]] (for the Kirov Ballet -1972, and for the Boshoi Ballet -1992); [[Yuri Grigorovich]] (for the Bolshoi Ballet -1994); [[Anna-Marie Holmes]] (for the Boston Ballet -1998); [[Ivan Liška]] and [[Douglas Fullington]] (partial reconstruction of Petipa's 1899 revival for the Bavarian State Ballet -2007), and Alexei Ratmansky and Yuri Burlaka (partial reconstruction of Petipa's 1899 revival for the Bolshoi Ballet -2007).

By the time the [[Russian Empire]] fell in 1917, the St. Petersburg edition of Adolphe Adam's score for ''Le Corsaire'' contained additional musical material from eleven composers: [[Cesare Pugni]], [[Prince Pyotr Georgievich of Oldenburg]], [[Léo Delibes]], [[Ludwig Minkus]], [[Prince Nikita Trubetskoi]], [[Riccardo Drigo]], [[Baron Boris Fitinhof-Schell]], [[Yuli Gerber]], [[Albert Zabel]], [[Alexander Zibin]], and [[Mikhail Ivanov (composer)|Mikhail Ivanov]] (all of these composers are rarely credited in modern productions). Although many modern productions credit Delibes jontly with Adam for the score, it is Pugni who has the greater musical contribution of additional material.

Today ''Le Corsaire'' is performed chiefly in two different versions - in [[Russia]] and parts of Europe companies have mounted productions derived from [[Pyotr Gusev]]'s 1955 revival, initially staged for the [[Maly Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Maly Theatre]] of Leningrad, and later for the [[Kirov Ballet]] in 1987 by [[Oleg Vinogradov]]. Outside of [[Russia]] and Europe (primarily in North America), many companies have mounted productions derived from [[Konstantin Sergeyev]]'s revival, initially staged for the [[Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet]] in 1973, and later for the [[Bolshoi Ballet]] in 1992. The most famous production derived from Sergeyev's version is [[American Ballet Theatre]]'s 1999 production.

== The Origins of ''Le Corsaire'' ==

[[Lord Byron]]'s 1814 poem ''The Corsaire'' was adapted for the ballet on five occasions throughout the early to mid 19th century. The first was staged by [[Giovanni Galzerani]] in 1826 for the [[La Scala|Ballet of La Scala]] in Milan.

On [[August 12]], [[1835]] a second adaptation of ''The Corsair'' was presented in Paris by the [[Ballet du Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique]] under the title ''L'Ile des pirates''. This ''ballet-pantomime'' was set to a libretto by the dramatist [[Adolphe Nourrit]], with choreography by the Opéra's Ballet Master [[Louis Henry]]. The music was a pastiche typical of the era, fashioned from airs by [[Beethoven]], [[Rossini]], and [[Luigi Carlini]] by the composer [[Casimir Gide]]. The great Ballerina [[Fanny Elssler]] danced the principal role of Hauptrolle to great accliam, but the production was only given nine performances.

The third adaptation was mounted by the Ballet Master [[Ferdinand Albert Decombè]] to the music of the French harpist [[Nicolas Bochsa]] for the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Ballet of the King's Theatre]] in 1837, a production which was revived in 1844 quite successfully.

The legendary Ballet Master [[Filippo Taglioni]] presented the fourth adaptation of Byron's ''The Corsair'' to the music of [[Herbert Gärich]] on [[March 13]], [[1838]] at the [[Berlin State Opera|Ballet of the Prussian Court Opera]] in Berlin.

A fifth adaptation of ''The Corsair'' proved to be among the most celebrated and enduring ballets ever created, first presented on [[January 23]], [[1856]] by the [[Académie Royale de Musique|Ballet du Théâtre Impérial de l´Opéra]] (The theatre was known more commonly as the ''Paris Opéra''. Today the ballet company is known as the [[Paris Opera Ballet]]). The work was the brainchild of the ''Minister of State'' [[Adolphe Billault]], who also served as director of the Théâtre Impérial de l´Opéra, and of the [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]], wife of [[Napoleon III of France|Emperor Napoleon III]].

The choreographer was the Paris Opéra's renowned ''Première Maître de Ballet en Chef'' [[Joseph Mazilier]], one of the most celebrated choreographers of his time, who was highly skilled in producing the full-length narrative ballets then in vogue. He had many successes to his credit, including ''[[Le Diable à Quatre (ballet)|Le Diable à Quatre]]'' in 1845, and ''[[Paquita]]'' in 1846. As was standard practice in 19th century ballet, a literary man was commissioned to write the libretto, and here Mazilier looked to the most celebrated dramatist available, [[Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges]], who fashioned a scenario loosely based on Byron's poem (Vernoy crafted libretti for many ballets throughout his life, most notably ''[[Giselle]]'' in collaboration with [[Théophile Gautier]] in 1841, and later for Petipa's ''[[The Pharaoh's Daughter]]'' in 1862). 

[[Image:Corsaire -Conductors score -1867.JPG|thumb|right|200px|<center>A page from the ''Bacchanale des Corsaires'' from Act I-Scene I of Adam's hand-written score for ''Le Corsaire'', held in the archives of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]]] 

''Le Corsaire'' was created primarily for the talents of the famous Italian ballerina [[Carolina Rosati]], who was then the Paris Opéra's reigning ''Prima''. Rosati was celebrated for her great beauty, strong ''pointes'', clean ''batterie'', precision of execution, and easily intelligible [[mime artist|mime]]. The score was commissioned, for a phenomenal fee of 6,000 [[franc]]s in addition to royalties, from [[Adolphe Adam]], who at that time was the most distinguished composer writing for both the ballet and the [[opera]] in France. The libretto for ''Le Corsaire'' went through many changes during the long months of the ballet's preparation, requiring Vernoy to be paid an additional 3,000 francs for the work. 

''Le Corsaire'' premiered to a resounding success, with Rosati's interpretation of the heroine Medora becoming the rage of Paris. The stage effects&mdash;designed and executed by the master machinist [[Victor Sacré]]&mdash;were hailed as the best yet seen on the stage of the Opéra. Sacré's realistic staging of the sinking Corsaire ship of the last scene became immortalized by [[Gustave Doré]]'s drawing.

In attendance for the first three performances were Emperor Napoleon III and his wife, the Empress Eugénie, who had played a large part in the work's gestation. So moved by ''Le Corsaire'' was the Empress that she exclaimed ''"In all my life I have never seen, and probably never shall see again, anything so beautiful or so moving."''

Adam's score was highly praised for its melodiousness, orchestration, and dramatic intensity. It was to be the composer's last work&mdash;he died of a heart attack on [[May 3]], [[1856]], nearly four months after the ballet's premiere. On the evening of the day of his death, ''Le Corsaire'' was given at the Paris Opéra in memoriam to him. In attendance was the royal family with their guest of honor, [[William I of Württemberg|King William I of Württemberg]]. As equally moved by the ballet as was the Empress Eugénie, Emperor Napoleon III gave orders that all of the evening's box office receipts be given to the composer's widow. 

''Le Corsaire'' was given 43 performances in 1856 alone at the Paris Opéra with only Rosati as Medora. Her interpretation of Medora was considered by all to be incomparable, and after her departure from Paris in 1859 the ballet was taken out of the repertory. Not long afterwards the Ballet Master Mazilier retired.

== ''Le Corsaire'' in Russia ==
=====The first production=====

''Le Corsaire'' was first staged in Russia by the [[Ballet Master]] [[Jules Perrot]] for the [[Imperial Ballet]] (today known as the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet) in St. Petersburg, being presented for the first time on {{OldStyleDate|January 12|1858|January 24}} at the [[Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre]]. The production was mounted especially for the Ballerina [[Ekaterina Friedbürg]], with the young [[Marius Petipa]] as Conrad. For this production Petipa assisted in rehearsals, and was permitted by Perrot to revise some of the dances, including the ''Pas des Éventails'' of act I-scene 2 (in which Medora and 6 ''coryphées'' create a "peacock effect" with large fans), and the character Gulnare's ''Scéne de seduction'' of act II.

=====Petipa's Revivals=====

By 1863, Jules Perrot had left Russia forever, and Petipa was serving as the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatre's second Balletmaster. The great choreographer [[Arthur Saint-Léon]] held the position of ''Première Maître de Ballet'' (first Ballet Master and Choreographer/Artistic Director) until his death in 1870. Upon the death of Saint-Léon Petipa was named ''Première Maître de Ballet'', a position he would hold until 1903. 

Over the course of his long career, Petipa revived ''Le Corsaire'' on four occasions, each time significantly revising the ''[[mise en scène]]'' and adding a substantial number of new ''[[pas]]'', variations, and incidental dances. His first revival was staged especially for his wife, the ''[[Prima Ballerina]]'' [[Mariia Surovshchikova-Petipa]], with the Danseur [[Christian Johannson]] as Conrad. The production premiered on {{OldStyleDate|Jauary 24|1863|February 5}}, and included new music and revisions by [[Cesare Pugni]], the Imperial Theatre's ''First Ballet Composer''.

Four years later [[Joseph Mazilier]] came out of retirement to mount a revival of ''Le Corsaire'' at the Paris Opéra for the German Ballerina [[Adèle Grantzow]], a production which was also staged in celebration of the [[Universal Exposition]]. For her performance Mazilier added a new ''[[Grand ballabile]]'' to the music of [[Léo Delibes]] titled as the ''Pas des fleurs''. Mazilier's new revival of ''Le Corsaire'' premiered on [[October 21]], [[1867]] to great success. The production was given 81 performances with Grantzow performaing the role of the heroine Medora. After her departure from Paris the work was again taken out of the repertory, never to be performed by the Parisian ballet again.

While performing ''Le Corsaire'' in Paris, Granztow was invited to perform with the Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg. For the occasion, Petipa staged a revival of ''Le Corsaire'' that included Mazilier's ''Pas de fleurs'', re-titled by Petipa as ''Le Jardin Animé'' (''The Animated Garden''), as it is still known today. For the revival, the composer Cesare Pugni again modified the score and added new music. The revival was given for the first time on  {{OldStyleDate|January 25|1868|February 6}}.

Petipa's third revival of ''Le Corsaire'' was presented in a lavish production on {{OldStyleDate|November 10|1885|November 22}}. The revival was staged especially for the talents of the Russian Ballerina [[Eugeniia Sokolova]].

St. Petersburg, 1899]]

Petipa presented his last and most important revival of ''Le Corsaire'' on {{OldStyleDate|January 13|1899|January 25}} January 13/25, [[1899]] at the [[Imperial Mariinsky Theatre]], rechoreographing the majority of the ballet. This production was mounted especially for the ''Prima Ballerina Assoluta'' [[Pierina Legnani]], with [[Olga Preobrajenskaya]] as Gulnare, and [[Pavel Gerdt]] as Conrad.

=====The notation of Petipa's 1899 revival=====

In 1894 the Imperial Ballet began documenting their repertory in [[Stepanov method of dance notation]]. The notation of ''Le Corsaire'' began in 1894 with the scene ''Le Jardin Animé'', and was completed in 1906. After the [[Russian revolution of 1917]] the Imperial Ballet's régisseur [[Nicholas Sergeyev]] brought the choregraphic documentation of out of Russia, utilizing it to stage such works as ''[[The Sleeping Beauty Ballet|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', ''[[Swan Lake]]'', and ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', as well as Petipa's definitive versions of ''[[Giselle]]'' and ''[[Coppélia]]'' for the first time in the west primarily for the [[Vic-Wells Ballet]](today the [[Royal Ballet]]). From there these ballets went on to be staged all over the world. In 1969 [[Harvard University]] purchased this collection, where it now resides as the [[Sergeyev Collection]].

In 2007, the Bavarian State Ballet utilized the notation to reconstruct 25 dances from Petipa's 1899 revival of ''Le Corsaire'' for their new production. The [[Bolshoi Ballet]] made use of the notations as well when they staged their lavish production of ''Le Corsaire'' in 2007.

==== Petipa's additional pieces ====

Petipa inserted a substantial number of supplemental ''[[pas]]'', variations and incidental dances into each of his revivals of ''Le Corsaire''. Today, many of these pieces are quite popular staples of the repertory and competion cicuit. 

=====The ''Pas d'esclave''=====

In 1858 Petipa interpolated a [[pas de deux]] taken from his 1857 ballet ''[[The Rose, the Violet, and the Butterfly]]'', a work set to the music of [[Prince Pyotr Georgievich of Oldenburg]]. Petipa titled the piece as the ''Pas d'Esclave''. 

The ''Pas d'Esclave'' is today presented in a heavily revised edition from Petipa's original. Petipa choreographed the ''Pas d'Esclave'' as a dramatic ''Pas d'action à trois'' during the ''[[divertissement]]'' of the first act, in which a slave girl was presented to the buyers of the Andrianople slave market in order to sell her. Originally the slave girl was partnered by a male slave and an additional suitor. By the time [[Agrippina Vaganova]] staged her version of ''Le Corsaire'' in 1931 for the Kirov Ballet, the ''Pas d'Esclave'' included the character of Gulnare in place of the slave girl. Vaganova further revised the ''[[pas]]'' by excluding the additional suitor. It was not until Pyotr Gusev's revival of ''Le Corsaire'' for the Leningrad Maly Theatre in 1955 that the character Lankendem began to take part in the ''Pas d'Esclave''.

Originally the ''Pas d'Esclave'' consisted of no variations for the soloists. Over time various solos were interpolated from various other ballets. The traditional variations in place today have been included in the ''Pas d'Esclave'' since the early 20th century. The first variation, traditionally danced by the character Lankendem, is set to music by the composer [[Alexander Zibin]]. Taken from an unknown work, the variation was first included in the ''Pas d'Esclave'' in December of 1914 by the Danseur [[Pierre Vladimirov]] (most noted as the first instructor of the male dancers at the [[School of American Ballet]], including the young [[Edward Villella]]). The Mariinsky Theatre's manuscript score for ''Le Corsaire'' titles the solo as ''Variation for Vladimirov''. The female variation, traditionally danced today danced by the character Gulnare, is taken from the composer [[Mikhail Ivanov (composer)|Mikhail Ivanov's]] score for Petipa's 1888 ballet ''[[The Vestal]]''. This variation was possibly added to the ''Pas d'Esclave'' around the turn of the 20th century. Today the variation is performed in an edition by the Ballet Master Pyotr Gusev.

=====''Finesse d'amour''=====

In 1863 Petipa added a ''Scène dansante'' for his wife, Maria Surovshchikova-Petipa, to new music by Pugni. The ''pas'' took place in the first act, with the heroine Medora teasing the Seid Pasha during the scene in the Bazaar. Only selected productions of ''Le Corsaire'' include this ''pas'' today. Recently, the [[Bolshoi Ballet]] presented Petipa's reconstructed choregraphy for ''Finesse d'amour'' in their 2007 production of ''Le Corsaire''.

=====''Pas de Six''=====

For his revival of 1863 Petipa added an elaborate ''Pas de six'' to new music by Cesare Pugni  in the second scene of act I. The ''[[pas]]'' was staged for the characters Medora, Conrad, and four ''coryphées''. The ''pas'' included only one variation for Medora and a dance for the four ''coryphées''.

The ''Pas de six'' was retained in the St. Petersburg edition of ''Le Corsaire'' until 1915. That year the ''pas'' was deleted and replaced by a ''[[Pas d'action]]'' created by the choregrapher [[Samuil Andrianov]]. This is the ''pas'' which would one day be called the ''[[Le Corsaire Pas de Deux]]''.

=====''Le Petite Corsaire''=====

In 1863 Petipa interpolated a '' pas de caractère'' into the second scene of act I for his wife, Maria Surovshchikova-Petipa, to new music by Pugni. In this solo the heroine Medora performs a polka with a prop megaphone while costumed as and imitating a Corsaire. The variation ends with the Ballerina shouting in Russian ''Au bord!''. ''Le Petite Corsaire'' went on to become one of the most celebrated passages of ''Le Corsaire'' (it is described by the Ballerina [[Tamara Karsavina]] in her famous biography ''[[Theatre Street]]''). Today the solo is retained only in selected productions of the ballet.

=====''Pas de trois des odalisques''=====

In 1863 Petipa expanded the ''Pas des odalisques'' of Act II. Originally this ''pas'' consisted only of Adolphe Adam's [[waltz]] from the original score. Petipa expanded this piece into a standard classical ''[[Pas de trois]]'', consisting of an ''[[Entrée (ballet)|entrée]]'' (being Adam's original waltz), 3 variations, and a [[coda (ballet)|coda]]. The first two variations and the coda were set to new music by Pugni, while the third variation was transferred from another part of Adam's original score. In modern times this piece has become quite popular, particularly the three variations which include Petipa's strictly academic choreography. Otfen these solos are performed in ballet competitions.

=====''Danse forbans''=====

In 1868 Petipa added a new [[mazurka]] into act I-scene 2 titled as the ''Danse forbans'', set to new music by Pugni. The Ballet Master choreographed the mazurka to be lead by the character Birbanto, who made his entrance with two prop [[musket]]s which he "fired" on stage to the musical accents. The mazurka proceeded with a large male ''corps de ballet'' dancing with their prop [[Scimitar]] swords. For his revival of 1899 Petipa moved the ''Danse forbans'' to the second scene of act I, where it is still retained today in many modern productions of ''Le Corsaire''.

=====Alternate variations=====

In 19th century ballet is was common practice for a Ballerina or [[Danseur]] to interpolate a variation from another work into a ballet. By the end of the 19th century the Imperial Theatre's archives contained an enormous catalogue of ballet music. Often the old "specialist ballet composers" of the Imperial Theatres would literally "custom score" a variation at the request of a dancer. Alternate variations had found their way into ''Le Corsaire'' throughout the work's performance history in Russia, but for Petipa's 1899 revival, new variations for Medora and Gulnare were used in substitution of Delibes' original solos in the scene ''Le Jardin Animé''. The first, danced by Olga Preobrajenskaya as Gulnare, was originally the ''Variation of Amour'' taken from the 1876 Petipa/Minkus ballet ''[[The Adventures of Peleus or Thetis and Peleus|The Adventures of Peleus]]'', while the second variation, danced by Pierina Legnani as Medora, was taken from Petipa's 1883 ballet ''[[Pygmalion or The Cyprus Statue|Pygmalion]]'' (a.k.a. ''The Cyprus Statue'') to the music of [[Prince Nikita Trubetskoi]]. 

The variation danced in 1899 by Olga Preobrajenskaya as Gulnare is no longer performed in ''Le Jardin Animé'' anywhere in the world, and has been replaced over time by a variation composed by [[Albert Zabel]] (principal harpist in the orchestra of the St. Petersburg [[Imperial Mariinsky Theatre]]), and is still danced by the character Gulnare in almost all productions of ''Le Corsaire'' during the scene ''Le Jardin Animé'' (this variation is danced by the Ballerina [[Paloma Herrera]] in the popular 1999 film of [[American Ballet Theatre]]'s production of ''Le Corsaire'').

The variation danced in 1899 by Pierina Legnani as Medora is still retained in the scene ''Le Jardin Animé'' in the [[Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet's]] production of ''Le Corsaire'' (this variation is danced by the Ballerina [[Altynai Asylmuratova]] in the popular 1989 film of the [[Kirov Ballet|Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet's]] production of ''Le Corsaire'').

In later times the variation for Medora in the scene ''Le Jardin Animé'' has been occasionally replaced. During ''Le Jardin Animé'', the Mariinsky ''Prima Ballerina'' [[Natalia Dudinskaya]] preferred to dance the rarely heard ''Variation of the Flower Girl'' taken from Ludwig Minkus' original score for Petipa's ''[[Don Quixote (ballet)|Don Quixote]]'' (this variation is danced by Medora during ''Le Jardin Animé'' in most western productions of ''Le Corsaire'', notably by [[Julie Kent]] in the popular 1999 film of [[American Ballet Theatre]]'s production of ''Le Corsaire'').

== The ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' ==

The ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' is one of the most popular and performed excerpts in all of classical ballet. In modern times, the piece has become a major repertory staple of ballet companies all of over the world, while many dancers perform it on the ballet competition circuit.

The origins of this famous piece are extremely obscured, largely due to the fact that ballet programs and films often incorrectly credit the wrong choreographer or composer, particularly with pieces derived from Imperial Russia, leading to widespread misconceptions about the origins of many pieces from the classical repertory. With regard to the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'', it is almost always attributed choregraphically to [[Marius Petipa]] (or as "after Petipa"), while its music is either attributed to [[Adolphe Adam]], or [[Riccardo Drigo]], and in some cases even to [[Ludwig Minkus]].

On [[January 11]], [[1915]], Petipa's 1899 revival ''Le Corsaire'' was presented in a new production by the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg. The choreography was performed largely unchanged from Petipa's 1899 design, but for the occasion, the Danseur [[Samuil Andrianov]], who performed the role of Conrad, arranged a new ''[[Pas d'action]] à Trois'' for Act I-Scene 2, which was created in order to supplement the ''Pas des Éventails'' (an elaborate ''[[Grand Pas]]'' which had been performed in the ballet since its original inception), and Petipa's interpolated ''Pas de Six'' of 1863 to the music of Pugni (Andrianov is most noted as the teacher of the young [[George Balanchine]] at the Imperial Ballet School). Andrianov's new ''Pas d'action à Trois'' was the piece which would one day be called the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux''.

The opening ''adagio'' was choregraphed for three dancers, being staged for the characters Medora and Conrad, and an additional suitor (being the same suitor who took part in the ''Pas d'Esclave'' of Act I-Scene 1). There followed variations for Conrad and Medora, with the piece finishing in a spectacular ''[[Coda (ballet)|coda]]''.

Andrianov set the piece to already existing music, with the exception of the ''coda'', which was written especially for the production by the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatre's [[kapellmeister]] [[Riccardo Drigo]]. Andrianov choreographed the opening ''[[Adagio (ballet)|adagio]]'' to a [[nocturne]] composed by Drigo titled ''The Dreams of Spring''. The variation danced by Andrianov as Conrad was taken from Petipa's 1870 ballet ''[[Trilby (ballet)|Trilby]]'', to music by [[Yuli Gerber]]. By the 1940s the variation came to be danced by the character known as the Slave, and later, Ali. This is the famous variation performed by all male dancers today in the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux''.

Tamara Karsavina, who danced Medora in 1915, performed a variation from the Petipa/[[Lev Ivanov|Ivanov]]/[[Enrico Cecchetti|Cecchetti]] ballet ''[[Cinderella (Fitinhof-Schell)|Cinderella]]'', set to a polka by the composer [[Baron Boris Fitinhof-Schell]]. Since 1915, Karsavina's variation has been substituted out quite often, though in Russia, particularly at the Mariinsky Theatre, her variation is still included in the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' (this variation is performed by [[Altynai Asylmuratova]] in the 1989 film of the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet's production of ''Le Corsaire'', as well as by [[Julie Kent]] in the 1999 film of American Ballet Theatre's production). 

In 1931, the great pedagogue [[Agrippina Vaganova]] revised the choreography of the ''Pas d'action à Trois'' as a ''Pas de deux'' especially for the graduation performance of her star pupil, [[Natalia Dudinskaya]], who was partnered by [[Konstantin Sergeyev]]. Through Vaganova's revision, the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' took on the basic shape it has today. In 1939 Vaganova's revision of the ''Pas de deux'' was interpolated into the Kirov Ballet's 1936 production of the full-length ''Le Corsaire'', danced by [[Galina Ulanova]] and [[Nikolai Zubkovsky]]. Over time, the original scheme of the piece being danced as a ''Pas de Trois'' was reinstated into the full-length ballet. It is now only performed as a ''Pas de deux'' at the Mariinsky Theatre during gala performances.

It was the noted ''Première Danseur'' of the Kirov Ballet, [[Vakhtang Chabukiani]], who had the most influential hand in refashioning the male dancing of the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux''. During his performances in the ''Pas'' during the 1930s and 1940s he gave the male role more athletic and virtuoso choreographic elements. His interpretaion of the male role became in essence the standard, and it has remained so to the present day.

When Pyotr Gusev staged his 1955 revival of ''Le Corsaire'' for the Maly Theatre in Leningrad, he restored the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' to its original form as a ''Pas d'action à Trois'', and eventually nearly all Russian productionsperfomed this ''Pas'' as such.

In 1960, [[Rudolf Nureyev]] staged the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' for himself and [[Margot Fonteyn]] in London. All that was available of Drigo's music in the west at the time was a piano reduction, and so Nureyev called upon [[John Lanchbery]] to create the orchestrations. Today, Lanchbery's arrangements are still in use by many ballet companies in the west.

=====The Slave Ali=====

Mikhail Obhukov, the Danseur who was the first to perform in the ''Pas d'action à Trois'' of 1915 that later became the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'', was simply a suitor for the Ballerina and had no other function in the rest of the ballet, aside from partnering the character Gulnare during the ''Pas d'Esclave'' of Act I. By 1937 when the Danseur Nikolai Zubkovsky performed the role, this suitor evolved into a character known as the ''Rhab'' (Russian for ''Slave''), and was identified as Conrad's slave who swears loyalty to Medora as her servant. By the time the Kirov Ballet's ''Première Danseur'' Vakhtang Chabukiani danced the role in the early 1940s, the character wore a costume which consisted of baggy pants and chains strapped around a shirt-less torso, while over time the costume came to include the now standard head-band with a feather protruding from the forehead. When Pyotr Gusev staged his revival of ''Le Corsaire'' for the Maly Theatre in 1955, the Rhab character was named Ali, and was given a more prevalent part in the ballet's action. This change in the character from a mere suitor to an exotic slave also gave rise to revisions in the choreography of the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'', with many of the dancers who performed in the role adding in more athletic and exotic elements of choreography.

=====Alternate Variations for the Ballerina=====

Fitinhof-Schell's variation from ''Cinderella'' danced by Tamara Karsavina in the original 1915 staging of the ''Le Corsaire'' ''Pas d'action à Trois'' - a quick solo in polka time - has been substituted out many times throughout the work's performance's history. In 1958 [[Rudolf Nureyev]] danced the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' with [[Alla Sizova]] for their graduation performance from the [[Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet|Vaganova Choreographic Institutution]] (school of the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet). For the occasion Sizova substituted the original Ballerina's variation for the ''Variation of the Dryad Queen'' from Alexander Gorsky's 1900 revival of Petipa's ballet ''[[Don Quixote (ballet)|Don Quixote]]'' (for this revival, Gorsky added new music by [[Anton Simon]], which included a variation for the Dryad Queen in the scene of Don Quixote's dream. Today this music is almost always incorrectly credited to Ludwig Minkus).

When Rudolf Nureyev staged the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' for the first time in the West, he also included the variation that Sizova danced for their graduation performance, likely due to the fact that the choreography suited the more lyrical gifts of the great Ballerina Fonteyn. For many years Nureyev's staging of the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' was the standard in the west, complete with Fonteyn's interpolated variation.

Another variation often danced in substitution of the original Ballerina solo is the ''Variation of Gamzatti'' from the ''Grand Pas d'action'' from the Petipa/Minkus ''[[La Bayadère]]''.  This variation is actually from the celebrated ''Pas de Venus'' of Petipa's 1868 ballet ''[[Tsar Kandavl]]'' (or ''Le Roi Candaule'') to the music of [[Cesare Pugni]], and was likely added to ''La Bayadère'' in the early Soviet period.  It is danced today in an edition by Pyotr Gusev, originally staged for Natalia Dudinskaya.

== Moscow Productions of ''Le Corsaire'' ==

In March 1858 Petipa was dispatched to mount the Perrot staging of ''Le Corsaire'' for the [[Ballet of the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre]], who performed the production with some regularity until it was taken from the repertory in 1880.  ''Le Corsaire'' was not performed again on the stage of the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre for over twenty years, when the Ballet Master [[Ivan Clustin]] presented his staging on [[March 22]], [[1902]], with the great Ballerina [[Adalaide Giuri]] as Medora, and [[Mikhail Mordkin]] as Conrad.

At the behest of [[Alexander Gorsky]], the company's ''Maïtre de Ballet en Chef'' since 1900, Clustine's production was removed from the Bolshoi's repertory after only fifteen performances, never to be performed again.  It was not until ten years later that a new production was staged in Moscow, being the work of Gorsky.  The production premiered [[January 12]], [[1912]], with [[Ekaterina Geltzer]] as Medora and [[Vasily Tikhomirov]] as Conrad.  Typical of his revivals of works from the classical St. Petersburg repertory, Gorsky added more ethnographic and historically accurate elements with regard to the setting and time in which ''Le Corsaire'' is set (the only surviving example of Gorsky's style in reviving the classical repertory is the famous ballet ''[[Don Quixote (ballet)|Don Quixote]]'', which is performed today all over the world in productions derived from his 1901 and 1903 editions staged in Moscow and St. Petersburg).

For his revival of 1912 Gorsky interpolated a substantial number of new dances and action sequences. Adolphe Adam's score served as the foundation, which included the traditional additional dances as added by Mazilier  and Petipa. Gorsky then made use of a number of airs taken from the works of such composers as [[Edvard Grieg]], [[Reinhold Glière]], [[Karl Goldmark]], [[Frédéric Chopin]], [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky]], and [[Antonín Dvořák]]. Gorsky commissioned the composer [[Anton Simon]] to assemble, adapt, and orchestrate the music, and even include a few numbers of his own. Among the most notable additions was a dream sequence set to a ''[[Nocturne]]'' by Chopin, in which the character Medora dreams of her beloved Conrad. Among other additions were dances for various Turkish, Persian, and Arabian slave-women during the Bazaar scene of the first Act, set to music by Anton Simon.

Gorsky's most striking addition was the ''[[Pas de deux]]'' which would one day be known as the ''[[Tchaikovsky Pas de deux]]''. Originally fashioned by Tchaikovsky from a supplemental ''Pas de deux'' by [[Ludwig Minkus]] for the original 1877 production of ''[[Swan Lake]]'', the piece was placed by the Ballet Master during the second act divertissement set in the Corsaire's underground palace.

Gorsky's revival lasted in the repertory of the Moscow Bolshoi Theatre until 1927. Although the company regularly performed extracts from ''Le Corsaire'' after the production was no longer in the repertory, the full-length work would not be given by the company until [[Konstantin Sergeyev]] presented his version in 1992.

== ''Le Corsaire'' in Leningrad and the West ==

Petipa's last revival of ''Le Corsaire'', which was given a new production in 1915, remained in the repertory of the [[Imperial Ballet]] (or [[Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet]] as it is known today) until 1928. Up to that point the 1899 revival had been performed 224 (after the 1917 Russian Revolution the company was known as the ''State Petrograd Ballet'', and later the ''State Academic Ballet'', before it was renaimed the ''Kirov Ballet'').

[[Agrippina Vaganova]], the revered pedagogue of Russian Ballet, supervised the first "after Petipa" revival of ''Le Corsaire'' for the Kirov Ballet, which was first performed on [[May 15]], [[1931]]. On [[May 21]], [[1936]] another revival of ''Le Corsaire'' was presented by the Kirov Ballet, with [[Natalia Dudinskaya]] as Medora, [[Mikhail Mikhailov]] as Conrad, and [[Vakhtang Chabukiani]] as the Slave (or Rhab, as the character was known in Russia). This was the first production of the full-length work to include Vaganova's 1931 revision of the ''Le Corsaire Pas de deux'' as staged for Dudinskaya's graduation performance. The ''Pas de deux'' was further revised by having the Slave who originally partnered the character Gulnare during the ''Pas d'Esclave'' participate in the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'', with the character of Lankendem performing in the ''Pas d'Esclave''. The 1936 revival did not last long in the company's repertory, and the Kirov Ballet would not perform the work for another thirty two years.

===Pyotr Gusev's Revival of 1955===

The Balletmaster [[Pyotr Gusev]] staged a new version of ''Le Corsaire'' for the [[Maly Theatre]] of Leningrad in 1955. This was the first production of the work to present a completely modified version of the libretto, written by Gusev and the ballet historian [[Yuri Slonimsky]], which included a new character - the slave Ali - who would also perform the ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux'' as the suitor.

Aside from the new libretto Gusev opted to do a complete revision of the ballet's score - although by this time the score for ''Le Corsaire'' contained the traditional interpolated dances by many composers, the majority of the score still belonged to Adolphe Adam. Gusev opted to discard nearly all of Adam's original score in favor of music fashioned out of themes from his 1842 ballet ''[[La Jolie Fille du Gand]]'' and his 1852 opera ''[[Si j'étais roi]]'', with the conductor [[Eugene Kornblit]] adapting and orchestrating the entire score. Another number  was taken from [[Riccardo Drigo]]'s score for Petipa's 1889 ballet ''[[The Talisman (ballet)|The Talisman]]'' - ''pizzicati'' for four Ballerinas added to the scene ''Le Jardin Animé''. Gusev the added dances for Turkish, Persian, and Arabian slave-women to music by Anton Simon, which was taken from Alexander Gorsky's 1912 revival at the Bolshoi Theatre. With the "new"  music fashioned from Adam's other works, new [[leitmotif]]s were created for the ballet's main characters, as well as an all new prologue - this scene included the standard opening of the ballet with the famous shipwreck, followed by a scene set on the sea-shore. Gusev added here a new Entrance for Medora, and an elaborate ''[[Pas]]'' for Gulnare, Medora, and ten other ballerinas, who subsequently find Conrad and his party washed ashore. Soon after the women are kidnapped by Lankendem and his cohorts, which causes Conrad and his party to go to their rescue. 

Gusev's revival premiered on [[May 31]], [[1955]], and went on to become the most popular version of ''Le Corsaire'' in Russia. In 1987 the director of the Kirov Ballet, [[Oleg Vinogradov]], staged Gusev's version for the company, who still retain the production in their repertory.

===Konstantin Sergeyev's Revival of 1973===

In 1973, the Ballet Master of the Kirov Ballet [[Konstantin Sergeyev]] staged his own completely new revision of ''Le Corsaire''. For this production Sergeyev included new variation for the characters Conrad and Birbanto in Act I, as well as a new Adagio for the characters Medora and Conard in Act II (this number is often referred to as the "Bedroom Pas de Deux"). 

Sergeyev's revival only lasted nine performances in the Kirov's repertory - the production was pulled when the Ballet Master fell into disfavor with the Soviet government due to the recent defections from the [[U.S.S.R.]] of [[Natalia Makarova]] and [[Mikhail Baryishnikov]]. His production was replaced in 1977 by Pyotr Gusev's revival, which was staged by the company's newly appointed director Oleg Vinogradov.

In 1989 the Kirov Ballet decided to present a revival of ''Le Corsaire'' for its upcoming world tour.  There was much debate as to whether Gusev's staging would be retained or whether Sergeyev's version would be reinstated.  In the end, the company chose to retain Gusev's version, while still lavishing the production with new sets and costumes.  This staging premiered to great success in New York at the [[Metropolitan Opera House]] on [[July 3]], [[1989]] with the Ballerina [[Altynai Asylmuratova]] as Medora (this production was filmed at the Mariinsky Theatre in April 1989, and has been released onto DVD/video).

In 1992 [[Yuri Grigorovich]], director of the [[Bolshoi Ballet]] of Moscow, invited Sergeyev to mount his 1973 revival of ''Le Corsaire'' for the company.  This production premiered on [[March 11]], [[1992]] to great success, but after only seven performances Grigorovich decided to pull the production from the repertory.  After witnessing the success of Sergeyev's production, Grigorovich decided to stage his own version, which included a refurbished score by the Bolshoi Ballet's chief conductor [[Alexander Sotnikov]].  This version premiered on [[February 16]], [[1994]], but was taken out of the repertory after Grigorovich left the company in 1995.

The sets and costumes designed by [[Irina Tibilova]] for Konstantin Sergeyev's production of ''Le Corsaire'' as staged in Moscow in 1992 sat unused in the archives of the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] for almost five years. At the suggestion of Sergeyev's wife, the celebrated Ballerina and teacher [[Natalia Dudinskaya]], [[Anna-Marie Holmes]] staged Sergeyev's production for the [[Boston Ballet]] (with the assistance of Dudinskaya, [[Tatiana Terekhova]], [[Sergei Berezhnoi]], [[Tatiana Legat]], and [[Vadim Disnitsky]]). The music for this production was copied from the conductor's score used for Sergeyev's production, as well as additional parts taken from the Mariinsky Theatre Library. In some cases the Boston Ballet used copies of the Bolshoi's score from Grigorovish's 1994 version, which contained orchestrations by Alexander Sotnikov. The Boston Ballet music librarian Arthur Leeth, the company pianist Marina Gendal, and conductor Jonathan McPhee performed a cut-and-paste operation on the score as the choreography was adapted for the new staging. This required the re-ordering of many numbers, as well as a few new transitional passages which were composed by Kevin Galie. Galie also did some minor reorchestrating throughout many parts of the score. This production premiered on [[March 27]], [[1997]] with the Ballerina [[Natasha Akhmarova]] as Medora, to great success.

Nearly one year later, [[American Ballet Theatre]] rented the Boston Ballet's production of ''Le Corsaire''. The staging went through even more revisions both choreographically and musically, with musical modifications performed by American Ballet Theatre conductor Charles Parker and the company pianist Henrietta Stern. A crucial change was the transformation of Mediterranean Corsaires into Caribbean Pirates - a change which is far removed from the original libretto. This production premiered on [[June 19]], [[1998]], with [[Nina Ananiashvili]] as Medora, [[Ashley Tuttle]] as Gulnare, [[Giuseppe Picone]] as Conrad, [[Jose Manuel Carreño]] as Ali, and [[Vladimir Malakhov]] Lankendem. The [[American Ballet Theatre|ABT]] production was later filmed at the [[Orange County Performing Arts Center]] in [[Costa Mesa]], [[California]] by [[PBS]] for [[Great Performances]] in 1999, with [[Julie Kent]] as Medora, [[Paloma Herrera]] as Gulnare, [[Ethan Steifel]] as Conrad, [[Angel Corella]] as Ali, and [[Vladimir Malakhov]] as Lankendem.

Today the full-length ''Le Corsaire'' has been staged by many companies all over the world. It is Pyotr Gusev and Konstantin Sergeyev's stagings that serve as the foundation for these productions, though to date there has not been a company who has chose to merge the two. Outside of Russia, primarily in Western Europe and the [[Americas]], it is Sergeyev's production that has been staged primarily, while in Russia and in Eastern Europe Gusev's revision has been staged for the most part.

== Pacific Northwest Ballet School's reconstruction of ''Le Jardin Animé'' ==

In June 2004 the School of the [[Pacific Northwest Ballet]] in [[Seattle]] presented a reconstruction of Petipa's choreography for the scene ''Le Jardin Animè'', taken directly from the notation of the [[Sergeyev Collection]]. It was staged by the dance historian and Stepanov notation expert [[Douglas Fullington]], and [[Manard Stewart]], former principle dancer of the Pacific Northwest Ballet.

== Bavarian State Ballet's Revival of 'Le Corsaire' ==

In 2006, the [[Bayerisches Staatsballett]] (Bavarian State Ballet) presented a partial reconstruction of Petipa's 1899 revival of ''Le Corsaire''. For this production, twenty-five of Petipa's original dances were reconstructed from the [[Stepanov Choreographic Notation]] of the [[Sergeyev Collection]].

Adam's music was restored from the original conductor's score in the archives of the ''Paris Opéra'', while still retaining the traditional additional dances Petipa added to his revivals throughout the mid to late 19th century.

== The Bolshoi Ballet's reconstruction ==

On [[June 21]], [[2007]] the [[Bolshoi Ballet]] presented a partial reconstruction of Petipa's 1899 revival of ''Le Corsaire'' in a lavish production that proved to be the most expensive production of a ballet ever mounted - at some $1.5 million [[USD]].

The choreography was restored for many of the dances from the choregraphic notation of the [[Sergeyev Collection]], while the music was reconstructed from Adam's original score. The production made use of music from Riccardo Drigo's score for [[Lev Ivanov]]'s 1887 ballet ''[[The Enchanted Forest]]''.

A patrol of Turkish traders, in league with the villainous slave dealer Lankandem, are hunting for beautiful woman to sell as slaves. The Turks soon capture the young Greek women, and are paid handsomely by Lankendem. They soon head off to the slave market in a Turkish bazaar, and the corsairs vow to rescue the unfortunate maidens.

'''''Scene 2: The Slave Market'''''
Amidst the bustle and barter the wealthy Seid Pasha turns up at the slave market to purchase beautiful young slave women for his harem. Lankendem shows off all of the fruits of his travels from foreign lands, and though he extols the beauty of captive maidens from Palestine and Algeria, the Pasha is not interested. Soon Lankendem presents Gulnare, who enchants the Pasha. Gulnare and Lankendem dance a ''Pas d'action'' (the ''Pas d'esclave''). He then pays handsomely for her as she is carried off to his harem. But Lankendem has saved his greatest spoil for last - the beautiful Medora. The Pasha soon makes his offer, but is soon outbid by an unknown trader, who is Conrad in disguise.

Conrad promises to free them, but Birbanto and his friends protest, and a fight breaks out. Conrad keeps his word and releases the woman. Lankendem, who has witnessed the conflict, strikes a deal with Birbanto and his friends - in exchange for his freedom, he informs them of a potion that, when sprinkled on a flower, can immideiately induce sleep. Birbanto and his friends agree. Conrad and Medora return, relishing in the chance to be alone together. Lankendem then offers Medora a bouquet of flowers to give to Conrad.

===Scenario for American Ballet Theatre's Version of ''Le Corsaire'' (derived from Sergeyev's version)===
'''''Characters'''''

* Conrad -- Captain of the corsair ship
* Ali -- Conrad's slave
* Birbanto -- First mate, and Conrad's friend
* Lankendem -- Slave dealer
* Medora -- the beautiful slave girl
* Gulnare -- Medora's friend
* Seyd -- A Turkish Pasha

===Prologue===
A pirate ship, manned by Conrad, his slave Ali, and his friend Birbanto, sails toward Turkey.

===Act I===
'''''The Bazaar'''''
Dealers and buyers fill a noisy bazaar where slave girls are being traded. Conrad and his men arrive where Lankendem, the owner of the bazaar, is selling girls. Conrad sees Medora, a slave girl, and falls immediately in love. Seyd, a Pasha, arrives on the scene amidst much fanfare. Lankendem presents three young women, who dance a ''Pas de Trois Classique'' (the ''Grand Pas de Trois des Odalisques'') whom the Pasha rejects. Lankendem then presents Gulnare, a lovely slave girl, and together Gulnare and Lankendem dance a ''Pas d'action'' (the ''Pas d'Esclave''). The Pasha buys her. Lankendem then presents a young slave girl, Medora, and everyone is entranced by her beauty. The Pasha buys her. Conrad instructs the slave to steal Medora back and the corsairs raid the village and kidnap Lankendem.

===Act II===
'''''The Grotto'''''
Conrad shows Medora his cave filled with treasure. Birbanto calls all the corsairs to bring in their stolen bounty to the grotto, as well as the slave girls and Lankendem. Medora, Conrad, and the slave Ali dance a ''Grand Pas Classique''  (the ''Grand Pas de Deux à Trois'' or ''Le Corsaire Pas de Deux''). Afterward, Medora entreats Conrad, in the name of their love, to free all the slave girls. He agrees, but Birbanto rebels against the idea and instead persuades the pirates to riot against Conrad. By the force of Conrad's commanding personality and physical presence, he single-handedly instills terror into the hearts of the corsairs and they abandon their mutinous plan. Not to be thwarted, Birbanto devises a new scheme. He sprays a rose with a [[sleeping potion]] and forces Lankendem to help him pass the flower to Medora, who unwittingly gives it to Conrad. He inhales its aroma and falls into a drugged sleep. The corsairs return to the grotto and attempt to capture Medora. While struggling, she snatches a dagger and cuts Birbanto's arm. In the confusion, Lankendem steals Medora back and escapes. Birbanto is about to kill Conrad but is interrupted by the slave. Stunned and broken-hearted, Conrad discovers Medora missing. Birbanto feigns ignorance and swears his loyalty to Conrad.

===Act III===
'''''Scene 1: The Pasha's Palace''''' The playful Gulnare is interrupted by Lankendem bringing a veiled Medora. The Pasha is delighted that Medora has been recaptured.

'''''Scene 2: Le Jardin Animé'''''' (''The Animated Garden'') The Pasha then decides to take a nap. He dreams of all of the beautiful women of his harem dancing in an enchanted flower garden. The woman dance a ''Grand Ballabile''.

'''''Scene 3: The Pasha's Palace''''' Conrad and his party arrive at the palace in disguise, waking the governor. Once inside, the maurauders attack the Pasha and his guards. After the residents flee, Medora names Birbanto as the traitor and Conrad kills him. Conrad, Ali, Medora and Gulnare all escape to the Corsaire ship.

'''''Scene 4: The Storm''''' The corsair ship sails upon a calm sea. Conrad, at the helm, cradles Medora in his arms. Suddenly a fierce storm blows across as lightning illuminates the darkening sky. Gusting winds shred the sails and a lightning bolt snaps the ship's mast in half. The ship sinks amidst the relentless, turbulent waters.

===Epilogue===
As the wind subsides and the sea calms itself, the moon rises in the sky. It sheds light upon Conrad and Medora, clinging to a rock and offering thanks for their miraculous survival, a testimony to the strength of their love.
