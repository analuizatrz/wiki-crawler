==Plot==
[[Image:9f03.jpg|left|200px|thumb|The title card for ''The Itchy & Scratchy Movie''.]]
Marge and Homer go to Parent Night at [[Springfield Elementary School]] and [[Edna Krabappel|Ms. Krabappel]] tells them that Bart needs more discipline, saying that Bart could become [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. Marge and Homer return home, where Bart had been wreaking havoc and had broken [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa]]'s [[false teeth]]. Bart is sent up to his room without dinner, but eventually Homer breaks and brings him some food (just as Bart was beginning to think that they might not give him any food after all, and that he would have to worry about consequences for his actions). Bart continues to get in trouble, and Homer does not enforce any of the punishments he gives out. Marge scolds Homer and he agrees that the next time he punishes Bart, he'll make it stick. Meanwhile, it is announced that there will be an ''Itchy & Scratchy Movie'' and in anticipation, Bart buys himself a ticket. Later on, Bart is left to babysit for Maggie and he neglects to watch her. Maggie escapes and takes Homer's car for a drive, finally crashing through the wall of Springfield's prison, which allows many of the prisoners to escape. Homer angrily blames Bart and punishes him by forbidding him to ever go see ''The Itchy & Scratchy Movie''. Homer takes Bart's ticket to the movie and tears it up. Bart begs to be given a different punishment but Homer refuses.

After the movie's release, Bart becomes jealous of everyone who has been able to see it. After a while, Marge and Lisa beg Homer to change his mind, saying that Bart has been very well behaved. However, Homer refuses to change his mind, saying that if he sticks with the punishment, Bart could become a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Eventually, the Movie closes and Bart tells Homer that he won, to which Homer replies by saying that they both won.

In a flashforward to forty years into the future, Bart, now Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and Homer are walking down the street and discover that the movie is back in theaters. Homer decides that Bart has learned his lesson and the two watch the movie together.<ref name="bbc"/><ref name=officialsite/><ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=[[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to our Favorite Family]] |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|id=ISBN 0-00-638898-1|pages=p. 236}}</ref>

==Production==
This episode, like many other ''[[Itchy & Scratchy]]'' themed episodes, was written by [[John Swartzwelder]], although the plot was originally pitched by [[Sam Simon]].<ref name="Reiss">{{cite video | people=Reiss, Mike|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> During the table read of the script, the first act received many laughs, but the second act got little positive reaction, leading [[Al Jean]] to believe that the script would require a huge rewrite, although the third act also received a positive reaction.<ref name="Jean"/> For ''The Itchy & Scratchy Movie'' shown at the end of the episode, [[Mike Reiss]] felt that it should top all other ''Itchy & Scratchy'' cartoons in terms of violence, and John Swartzwelder wrote the "most disturbing, horrible sequence", none of which was used.<ref name="Reiss"/>

This was the first episode that [[Rich Moore]] directed at [[Film Roman]].<ref name="Moore">{{cite video | people=Moore, Rich|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The shot of the Korean animation studio really angered the Korean animators and [[Greg Vanzo]], the overseas director, was really insulted and almost sent the scene back.<ref name="Moore"/> Whilst drawing the ''Steamboat Itchy'' sequence, the animators jokingly referred to it as "Steamboat Lawsuit". [[David Silverman]] explained that he did not know "why [they] weren't sued because there's a shot right out of ''Steamboat Willie'' in [the episode]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_12524.html|title=The Simpsons Movie Interviews|accessdate=2007-08-02|author=Sheila Roberts|publisher=Movies Online}}</ref> 

The episode features the first appearance of [[Bumblebee Man]], who is a caricature of "[[El Chapulín Colorado]]" ("The Red Grasshopper"), a character created and portrayed by Mexican television comedian [[Roberto Gómez Bolaños]] (aka "Chespirito"), and his show consists of simple skits, often involving heavy [[slapstick]]. According to the producers whenever they watched [[Telemundo]], this character was always "on", and then they created Bumblebee Man, who is also always "on".<ref name="Reiss"/>

==Cultural references==
[[Image:Steamboat Itchy.png|left|200px|thumb|The Itchy & Scratchy short "Steamboat Itchy", parodies ''[[Steamboat Willie]]''.]]
The opening ''[[Star Trek]]'' film is a parody of how old the crew of the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original ''Star Trek'']] cast looked in the later movies.<ref name="Jean"/> The 1928 "Itchy & Scratchy" short "Steamboat Itchy" is a spoof of the 1928 Disney short, ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'', the debut of [[Mickey Mouse]].<ref name=bbc/> Lisa's line about [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Dustin Hoffman]] appearing anonymously in ''The Itchy & Scratchy Movie'' is a reference to the fact that both had made guest appearances on ''The Simpsons'' using fake names in "[[Stark Raving Dad]]" and "[[Lisa's Substitute]]", respectively.<ref name="Reiss"/> Homer is seen listening to "[[Yummy Yummy Yummy]]" by [[The Ohio Express]] instead of watching the [[moon landing]].<ref name=bbc/> In the flashforward sequence, Homer says "Mmmmm ... soylent green", a reference to the 1973 [[science fiction film]] ''[[Soylent Green]]''.<ref name=bbc/>

==Reception==
During the fourth season, ''The Simpsons'' usually aired on a Thursday, but "Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie" aired on a Tuesday because the executives at Fox had wanted to air an episode during the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]] results because they felt it would mean increased ratings.<ref name="Jean">{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Instead, the episode had approximately 80% of its normal audience.<ref name="Reiss"/>

Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'' called it a "superb episode", especially "[Homer]'s suggestion for punishing Bart's misbehaviour is to give him a present, and his trick for avoiding jury duty is 'to say you're prejudiced against all races'."<ref name=bbc/> "Steamboat Itchy" is one of Matt Groening's favorite moments in the history of the show.<ref name="Groening">{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>
