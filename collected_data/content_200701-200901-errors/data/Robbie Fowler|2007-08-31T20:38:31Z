'''Robert Bernard 'Robbie' Fowler''', born [[9 April]] [[1975]] is an [[England|English]] [[Football (soccer)|footballer]] who currently plays for Championship side [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. 

Fowler's career began with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], with whom he made his debut in 1993. Fowler scored 120 premiership goals for Liverpool in an eight year period. He subsequently played for [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Manchester City F.C.]], before returning to Liverpool in January 2006. As of August [[2007]], Fowler is the fourth [[FA Premier League#Top scorers|highest goalscorer]] in [[FA Premier League|Premier League]] history, behind [[Thierry Henry]], [[Andy Cole]] and [[Alan Shearer]]. 

He has been [[cap (football)|capped]] for [[England national football team|England]] twenty-six times, scoring seven goals. The most recent of these appearances came in the [[FIFA World Cup 2002|2002 World Cup]].

==Early life==
Fowler was born Robert Bernard Ryder<ref>http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N156263070702-1648.htm</ref> in [[Liverpool]] and brought up in the [[Toxteth]] area. He was present in the area at the age of 6 during the [[Toxteth riots]]. As a youngster he was an ardent [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] supporter, regularly travelling to [[Goodison Park]]. He played regularly for schoolboy team Thorvald, and once scored 16 times in a 26–0 rout<ref>http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N156263070702-1648.htm</ref>. He was selected for Liverpool Schoolboys from the age of 11 and was spotted by Liverpool scout Jim Aspinall. He began training with Liverpool once a week and signed schoolboy forms with the club. Two years later he signed as a [[Youth Training Scheme|YTS]] trainee, and turned professional on his seventeenth birthday.

==Football career==
===Liverpool===
Fowler's first involvement with the Liverpool first team came on [[13 January]] [[1993]], when he was an unused substitute in an [[FA Cup]] tie against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton]]. In the following close season, Fowler helped the England Under-18 team to win the 1993 European Championship,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/U18s/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2003/07/56208.htm |title=

Player Profile - Robbie Fowler |publisher=4thegame|accessdate=22 August |accessyear=2007 }}</ref> He scored his first league [[hat-trick]] against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in only his fifth league game. His first thirteen games for the club yielded twelve goals, and he was rewarded with an England Under-21 debut against San Marino in November 1993, in which he scored England's opening goal in the third minute. Fowler was unable to sustain his goal-a-game ratio throughout the season, but finished his first season as the club's leading scorer with eighteen goals in all competitions.<ref name="4thegame"/> 

In the [[1994-95 in English football|1994–95]] season, Fowler was an ever-present for Liverpool, playing in all of their 57 matches, including the victory in the 1995 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] final, and a match against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]  in which he scored a hat-trick in four minutes and thirty-three seconds,<ref>{{cite book |author=Robbie Fowler and David Maddock |title=Fowler: My Autobiography |d=ISBN 1-4050-5132-9 | publisher=Macmillan |year=2005 |pages=128 }}</ref> a Premiership record. Fowler was voted the [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] in two consecutive years (in 1995 and 1996),<ref name="MEN factfile">{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester_city/s/147/147761_robbie_fowler_factfile.html|title=
Robbie Fowler Factfile |publisher=Manchester Evening News|accessdate=21 August |accessyear=2007 }}</ref> a feat equalled only by [[Ryan Giggs]] and [[Wayne Rooney]].

Throughout the mid and late 1990s, Fowler was widely considered to be the most natural finisher playing in England.<ref>{{cite web|authorlink= |coauthors= |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2001/11/19/sfntal20.xml |title=
Gripping battle of the red predators |format= |pages= |publisher=The Telegraph | language= |accessdate=19 June |accessyear=2006 }}</ref> Fowler sealed this reputation as he scored more than thirty goals for three consecutive seasons, up to 1997. [[Stan Collymore]], Fowler's old strike partner, said in his autobiography that Fowler was the best player he has ever played with. Fowler and Collymore were among the most lethal strike partnership in England during the 1995–96 season. In the same season he scored twice in a 4–3 victory over Newcastle, a match considered the best of the decade <ref>{{cite web|authorlink= |coauthors= |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N151936060403-1217.htm |title=
10 YEARS AGO TODAY: MATCH OF THE DECADE |format= |pages= |publisher=The Telegraph | language= |accessdate=23 April |accessyear=2007 }}</ref>

On the December the 14th [[1996]], he scored four against [[Middlesbrough F.C.]], the second of which reached a century of goals one game quicker than his mentor, [[Ian Rush]]. Also in 1996 Fowler received a call-up to the full England squad for the first time in 1996, winning his first cap on [[27 March]] against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] as a substitute,<ref name="MEN factfile"/> and making his first start at international level in England's next match, against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]. Fowler was part of the England squad for [[1996 European Football Championship|Euro 96]], making two appearances in the tournament.  

In 1997, after scoring a goal in a [[Cup Winners' Cup]] game, he lifted his Liverpool shirt to reveal a T-shirt supporting sacked [[Liverpool Dockers' Strike|Liverpool dockers]] for which he picked up a fine, but greatly increased his popularity on [[Merseyside]].<ref>{{cite web|authorlink= |coauthors= |url=http://libcom.org/library/robbie-fowler-fined-supporting-liverpool-dockers |title=

Fowler was part of a group of Liverpool players from the mid-1990s who were nicknamed "The Spice Boys" by the press following a series of off-field controversies. The term was coined by the [[Daily Mail]], and arose due to misplaced rumours that Fowler was dating [[Spice Girls|Spice Girl]] [[Emma Bunton]].<ref>Fowler: My Autobiography, p171-173</ref> The term was subsequently used in a derogatory manner, implying Fowler and colleagues such as [[Jamie Redknapp]], [[Stan Collymore]], [[David James (footballer)|David James]] and [[Steve McManaman]] were underachieving playboys. 

A downturn in Fowler's fortunes began in 1998, after a knee ligament injury kept him out of action for half the season and caused him to miss the [[FIFA World Cup 1998|1998 World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2007/04/12/sfnfow12.xml|title=
 Fowler searches in vain for fitting end |publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=23 August |accessyear=2007 }}</ref> This injury coincided with the rise of [[Michael Owen]], whose debut came in 1997. Owen firmly established himself in the Liverpool team in Fowler's absence. 

In 1999, Fowler was fined £60,000 by his club for bringing the game into disrepute after he had mimed snorting [[cocaine]] off the white line of the [[Penalty area (football)|penalty area]] while celebrating his goal against [[Everton F.C.]]<ref name="MEN factfile"/> Defending himself, he said that he was getting back at Everton fans who had insulted him with false accusations of [[Recreational drug use|drug abuse]]. Fowler received a four match suspension from [[The Football Association|the FA]] for this incident. At the same FA disciplinary hearing, Fowler received a further two match suspension due to a separate incident in which he had [[homophobic]]ally taunted [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] defender [[Graeme Le Saux]] by waving his backside at him. The FA imposed a £32,000 fine for the two incidents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,41304,00.html|title=Fowler hit with six-match ban and record fine |publisher=Guardian|accessdate=26 August |accessyear=2007 }}</ref>

====Treble Season====

The [[2000-01 in English football|2000–01]] season was Robbie’s most successful season, He would appear in three finals scoring 17 goals and lifting three trophies in a unique [[The Treble|Cup Treble]]. In the absence of [[Jamie Redknapp]], who was sidelined by injury, Fowler was named Liverpool captain when starting.<ref name="4thegame"/> However he found himself the third choice Liverpool striker, with Houllier favouring a forward partnership of [[Michael Owen]] and [[Emile Heskey]].<ref name="4thegame"/>  

He did take part in a fourth round [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] hammering of [[Stoke City F.C|Stoke City]] scoring a hat trick in an 8–0 victory en route to Liverpool’s first of three finals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20001130/ai_n14355735 |title=Football: Fowler hat-trick leads Liverpool record rout |accessdate=2007-08-23 |publisher=Independent }}</ref> In the [[Football League Cup Final 2001|final]] against [[Birmingham F.C.|Birmingham]], the club's first cup final since [[1996]], he captained the side, scoring on thirty minutes. Liverpool went on to win the trophy on penalties. Fowler picked up the Alan Hardaker Man of the Match award and lifted the trophy.

Fowler’s season picked up from there as he scored several important goals including a memorable goal against Manchester United and a free kick in the [[FA Cup]] semi-final against [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]]. He featured as a substitute [[FA Cup Final 2001|2001 FA Cup Final]] coming on as a 77th minute replacement for [[Vladimír Šmicer]]. Liverpool, who were 1–0 down at that point, eventually won the game 2–1 with two goals from [[Michael Owen]]. Fowler raised the trophy along with [[Sami Hyypiä]] and [[Jamie Redknapp]].

Four days later he was a substitute again in Liverpool’s third final, the [[2001 UEFA Cup Final]] against [[Deportivo Alavés|Alaves]]. He came on in the 64th minute for Emilie Heskey with the score at 3–3. He scored seven minutes later but Alaves equalised before full time and Liverpool eventually won with a [[golden goal]], an own goal, in the 116th minute.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2001/05/16/sfgliv17.xml |title=UEFA Cup Final: Liverpool hit treble top |accessdate=2007-08-23 |publisher=Daily Telegraph}}</ref> Fowler and Hyypia then raised Liverpool’s third trophy of the season together. Liverpool’s next and final game of the season was against [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton]]. Fowler scored twice in a 4–0 victory that assured them [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] qualification for next season.

====End of First Liverpool Run====

Fowler began the [[2001-02 in English football|2001–02 Season]] amidst controversy with then Liverpool manager [[Gérard Houllier]] when he was dropped from the entire squad for Liverpool's 2–1 victory in the 2001 [[Community Shield]] match against rivals [[Manchester United]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/1487707.stm |title=Fowler sweats on Anfield future   |accessdate=2007-05-26 |last= |first= date=2001-07-13 |publisher=bbc.co.uk }}</ref> He made an appearance in Liverpool's 3–2 victory over European Champions [[Bayern Munich]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/match/season/2001-2002/aug/149/teamsheet.htm |title=Liverpoolfc.tv : 2001-2002 : BAYERN MUNICH 2 - 3 LIVERPOOL   |accessdate=2007-05-26 |last= |first= date=2001-07-24 |publisher=bbc.co.uk }}</ref> but starts were intermittent. In October [[2001]], he scored his first league hat-trick for three years, helping Liverpool beat [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] 4&ndash;1, but was dropped for the following league game. Speculation over Fowler's future persisted for most of Houllier's tenure and became an issue that divided Liverpool fans. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/sports_talk/1488513.stm |title=Is Fowler's Anfield future bleak?   |accessdate=2007-05-26 |last= |first= date=2001-08-12 |publisher=bbc.co.uk }}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/1490333.stm |title=Fowler divides Liverpool fans   |accessdate=2007-05-26 |last= |first= date=2001-08-14 |publisher=bbc.co.uk }}</ref>

His last appearance before leaving the club was against [[Sunderland F.C.|Sunderland]], in which he was substituted at half-time.<ref>''Fowler: My Autobiography'', p317</ref>

===Leeds United===
Despite his popularity with Liverpool fans, who referred to Fowler as "God",<ref>{{cite web | title= 	
Liverpool - City of God | work=UEFA | url=http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/kind=512/newsid=390452.html| accessdate=August 23| accessyear=2007 }}</ref>  a combination of off-field controversy, disputes with Gérard Houllier and training ground arguments with then Assistant Manager [[Phil Thompson]],<ref name="ESPN">{{cite web | title= Robbie Fowler| work=ESPN Soccernet | url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7956&cc=5739| accessdate=September 10| accessyear=2006 }}</ref> led to Fowler's departure to [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]]. Fowler maintains that Houllier forced him out of Liverpool, and accused Houllier of pressuring the [[Liverpool Echo]] newspaper to use its influence to turn opinion against him.<ref name="Observer">{{cite web | title=

The transfer went ahead just one month after his hat-trick at Leicester with a fee of £11 million. He made his Leeds debut in an away game against Fulham,<ref>{{cite web | title=

Fowler scored 12 goals in the remainder of the season, helping Leeds to a [[UEFA Cup]] qualifying place. Fowler was included in the England squad for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], but only made one appearance, coming on as substitute in a second round win over [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]. 

Fowler suffered an aggravation of a pre-existing hip injury in the 2002–03 pre-season, and did not recover until December.<ref name="ESPN"/> Struggling to gain fitness, and seeing team-mates sold off due to a financial crisis, Fowler's form and market value diminished. However, in total he scored 15 goals in 31 appearances for Leeds; a goal every two games.

===Manchester City===
In the [[2002-03 in English football|2002–03 season]], Fowler was transferred to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] following a protracted transfer saga. Fowler initially turned down the move, and  a dispute between Manchester City manager [[Kevin Keegan]] and chairman [[David Bernstein (executive)|David Bernstein]] over whether the transfer should take place due to medical concerns resulted in Bernstein leaving the club.<ref>{{cite web | title= The costly truth about Fowler| work=Manchester Evening News | url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester_city/s/132/132149_comment_the_costly_truth_about_fowler.html| accessdate=August 22| accessyear=2007 }}</ref> Following encouragement from Keegan, Fowler finally signed for Manchester City on [[16 January]] [[2003]] for an initial fee of £3 million and a further £3 million dependent upon appearances.<ref name="MEN factfile"/> Bizarre transfer conditions meant Leeds United still paid a significant proportion of Fowler's wages.<ref>{{cite web | title= New Leeds chairman uncovers fishy past| work=Guardian | url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,9753,960304,00.html| accessdate=August 22| accessyear=2007 }}</ref> Fowler made his Manchester City debut against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on [[1 February]] [[2003]],<ref>{{cite web | title= Baggies grab vital victory| work=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2694025.stm| accessdate=August 22| accessyear=2007 }}</ref> but made a poor start to his Manchester City career, scoring just two goals in the remainder of the season. 

Fowler continued to struggle with fitness problems in the 2003–04 season, completing the full 90 minutes only nine times. The arrival of close friend [[Steve McManaman]] from [[Real Madrid]] gave hope, but the pair failed to rekindle their prolific partnership of yesteryear, and received criticism from the fans and tabloids for their salaries and alleged excesses.<ref>{{cite web | title= Spice Boy grows up| work=Guardian | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1308935,00.html| accessdate=June 21| accessyear=2006 }}</ref> In 2004 Fowler, depressed by his lack of form and fitness, considered retiring, but was persuaded to carry on by Kevin Keegan and [[Stuart Pearce]].<ref>Fowler: My Autobiography, p354-355</ref> He then showed a marked improvement in the second half of the [[2004-05 in English football|2004–2005]] season, scoring his 150th Premiership goal in the 3&ndash;2 win over [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich]] on [[28 February]] [[2005]]. However, his failure to convert a 90th minute penalty kick against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in the final game of the season prevented Manchester City from gaining a place in the [[UEFA Cup]].<ref>{{cite web | title=  City pay the penalty for Fowler miss | work=Daily Telegraph | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2005/05/16/sfgmac16.xml| accessdate=August 21| accessyear=2007 }}</ref> Fowler ended the season as the club's joint top goal scorer,<ref>{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=Manchester City - The Complete Record |publisher=Breedon |location=Derby |date=2006 |id=ISBN 1-85983-512-0}} p504</ref> and gained the approval of the fans, finishing in the top three in the fans' Player of the Year poll, described by Fowler as "one of the proudest achievements of my career".<ref>Fowler: My Autobiography, p347</ref>

Fowler had injury problems at the start of the [[2005-06 in English football|2005–06]] season, and rarely featured when fit, making just two substitute appearances in the first four months of the season. His first start of the season came against [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe]] in the FA Cup on [[7 January]] [[2006]], in which he scored a hat-trick.<ref>{{cite web | title= Man City 3-1 Scunthorpe | work=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/4565242.stm| accessdate=August 21| accessyear=2007 }}</ref> The following week he scored Manchester City's third goal in their 3&ndash;1 win against local rivals [[Manchester United F.C.]] after coming on as substitute. After scoring, he ran to the United supporters, holding up five fingers in reference to Liverpool's five [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] wins, in comparison to United's two. His goal celebration against United would prove to have added significance in the following weeks. However, Fowler made only one more appearance for Manchester City before returning to Liverpool on a free transfer.

===Return to Liverpool===
On [[27 January]] [[2006]], Fowler rejoined Liverpool from Manchester City on a free transfer, signing a contract until the end of the season. Fowler had remained a Liverpool fan after he left the club; he was in the [[Istanbul]] crowd when Liverpool won the Champions League in 2005.

Fowler's return against [[Birmingham City F.C.]] in February [[2006]] was labelled by the press as the stuff of fairytales, and he himself said he felt like 'a kid waking up on Christmas morning every day'. Fowler's first appearance back at Anfield was as a substitute against Birmingham, receiving a rapturous reception upon his introduction. He almost got off to a dream start, scoring a goal in the dying minutes, only for the referee to disallow it for [[Offside law (football)|offside]]. After his return, he had three goals ruled out for offside, before finally getting off the mark on [[15 March]] [[2006]] in a home game against [[Fulham]], the same opponents against which he scored his first ever goal for Liverpool 13 years earlier. 

Fowler's next Liverpool goal, against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], meant he overtook [[Kenny Dalglish]] in the club's all time top scorers, while he marked his 31st birthday with a goal against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. He made it four goals in five games when he scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory over [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on [[April 16]] [[2006]]. However, Fowler's fitness remained a concern. In March 2006, Rafael Benitez commented on how pleased he was with Fowler's work and progress adding, "to buy a Robbie Fowler who is fit and scoring goals would cost a lot, maybe £10m or more". Despite these concerns about his fitness, Fowler finished the 2005–6 season scoring on a more consistent basis than Liverpool's other strikers. In May 2006 he was offered a new one year contract with the club,<ref> {{cite web | title= Fowler to sign new Liverpool deal| work=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/4977356.stm| accessdate=May 21| accessyear=2006 }}</ref> and celebrated by scoring the first goal in Liverpool's last league game of the season in a 3–1 away win at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]. It was his final game of the 2005–6 season, as he was unable to take part in the club's [[2006 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]] success due to being [[cup-tied]].

Fowler featured rarely in his final Liverpool season, making only six league starts. Bizarrely, all three of his League goals were penalties against Sheffield United. Appearances in other competitions were more common due to Rafael Benitez's squad rotation policy. On the [[25 October]] , [[2006]] Fowler was named as Liverpool's [[captain (football)|captain]] for the first time since his return in a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] tie against [[Reading F.C.|Reading Football Club]], scoring just before half-time in a 4–3 win.

On [[5 December]] , [[2006]], Robbie Fowler scored his first two goals in the <ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6210854.stm |title=Clockwatch: Champions League |accessdate=2007-02-24 |last=Cheese |first=Caroline date=2006-12-05 |publisher=BBC Sport online }}</ref> [[UEFA Champions League]] competition proper against [[Galatasaray S.K.|Galatasaray]] (he had previously scored during a qualifying tie some 6 years prior against FC Haka),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/football/champions_league/1500956.stm |title=Liverpool stroll past FC Haka  |accessdate=2007-08-23 |publisher=BBC }}</ref> though Liverpool lost 3–2.

On the [[1st May]] [[2007]] he was a substitute in the [[UEFA Champions League]] Semi-Final against [[Chelsea FC]] brought on in the last few minutes of [[extra-time]]. He set up an attack for [[Dirk Kuyt]] but the shot went straight at the Chelsea keeper. The match went into a penalty shoot-out that Liverpool won. Fowler was due to take the fifth and final spot-kick, but the game had already ended when Dirk Kuyt slotted home his winning penalty.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N155818070502-1501.htm |title=RAFA HAILS SPOT-KICK HERO ZENDEN   |accessdate=2007-05-02 |last= |first= date=2007-05-02 |publisher=liverpoolfc.tv }}</ref>

In what transpired to be his last appearance for the club, against [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] on [[13 May]] [[2007]], Fowler was given the captain's armband one final time. He was substituted two minutes from the final whistle and given a standing ovation. The crowd still chanted his name as the match finished and applauded him for his years of service. He finished his second run as a Liverpool player with a [[UEFA Champions League]] runners up medal, however, he was not named in either the starting eleven or the seven substitutes.

==Outside football==
In association with [[Steve McManaman]], Fowler has invested in several racehorses through a company named ''The Macca and Growler Partnership'', most notably 2003 Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Celebration Chase
winner [[Seebald]].<ref>{{cite web |title=People in racing: Celebrities |work=British Horse Racing |url=http://www.britishhorseracing.com/goracing/racing/peopleinracing/celebrities/1.1.7.4.asp|accessdate=August 23 |accessyear=2007}}</ref> In 2005, Fowler was listed as one of the 1,000 wealthiest Britons by the ''[[Sunday Times Rich List]]''. Business interests including a large property portfolio have resulted in Fowler becoming the third wealthiest footballer,<ref>{{cite web |title=Beckham tops football's rich list |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6212696.stm|accessdate=December 6 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> in Britain, and leading to the affectionate, Manchester City chant; ''We all live in a Robbie Fowler house'' (to the tune of [[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]).<ref name="Observer" /> 

On [[2 September]] [[2005]] he released 'Fowler: My Autobiography', about his time as a footballer and the issues surrounding him. Since his transfer to Liverpool he has updated it and included a section about his return to [[Anfield]]. Excerpts published in newspapers included criticism of the England management. 

Fowler married wife Kerrie on [[9 June]] [[2001]], in the town of [[Duns]] in the [[Scottish Borders]], and has three daughters.<ref>''Fowler: My Autobiography, p351</ref>
