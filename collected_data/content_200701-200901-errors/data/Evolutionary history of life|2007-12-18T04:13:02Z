{{main|Origin of life}}
The details of the origin of life are unknown, though the broad principles have been established. It has been proposed that life, or at least organic components, may have arrived on [[Earth]] from space (see [[Panspermia]]), while others argue that terrestrial origins are more probable. The mechanisms by which life would initially arise are nevertheless held to be similar.<ref name="Scientific-American-panspermia">{{cite journal

Somehow, in the energetic chemistry of early Earth, a molecule (or even something else) gained the ability to make copies of itself&mdash;the replicator. The nature of this molecule is unknown, its function having long since been superseded by life’s current replicator, [[DNA]]. In making copies of itself, the replicator did not always perform accurately; some copies contained an error. If the change destroyed the copying ability of the molecule, there could be no more copies, and the line would die out. On the other hand, a few rare changes might make the molecule replicate faster or better; those strains would become more numerous and successful. As choice raw materials (food) became depleted, strains which could exploit different materials, or perhaps halt the progress of other strains and steal their resources, became more numerous.<ref name="Dawkins-Ancestors-563">{{cite book

There is currently no method of determining which of these models, if any, closely fits the origin of [[Organism|life on Earth]]. One of the older theories, and one which has been worked out in some detail, will serve as an example of how this might occur. 

The high energy from volcanoes, [[lightning]], and [[ultraviolet radiation]] could help drive chemical reactions producing more complex molecules from simple compounds such as [[methane]] and [[ammonia]].<ref name="Fortey-38">{{cite book

All [[organisms]] on [[Earth]] are descended from a common ancestor or ancestral gene pool.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Penny, D.; A.

Secondly, the diversity of life is not a set of completely unique organisms, but organisms that share morphological similarities. Thirdly, vestigial traits with no clear purpose resemble functional ancestral traits, and finally, that organisms can be classified using these similarities into a hierarchy of nested groups.

Past species have also left records of their evolutionary history. [[Fossil]]s, along with the comparative anatomy of present-day organisms, constitute the morphological, or anatomical, record.<ref name=Jablonski>{{cite journal |author=Jablonski, D. |title=The future of the fossil record |journal=Science |volume=284 |issue=5423 |pages=2114&ndash;6 |year=1999 |pmid=10381868}}</ref> By comparing the anatomies of both modern and extinct species, paleontologists can infer the lineages of those species. However, this approach is most successful for organisms that had hard body parts, such as shells, bones or teeth. Furthermore, as prokaryotes such as [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] share a limited set of common morphologies, their fossils do not provide information on their ancestry.

More recently, evidence for common descent has come from the study of [[biochemistry|biochemical]] similarities between organisms.

== Life before Cambrian ==

The '''Precambrian''' extends from 4.6 billion years ago to the beginning of the [[Cambrian]] Period (about 570 [[annum|Ma]]).
It is not known when life originated, but carbon in 3.8 billion year old rocks from islands of western [[Greenland]] may be of organic origin.  Well-preserved bacteria older than 3.46 billion years have been found in [[Western Australia]].  Probable fossils 100 million years older have been found in the same area.

The earliest cells had to form and exist in anoxic conditions. They were probably chemosynthetic.<ref>Gore, Pamela J.W. ([[February 3]] [[1999]]). "[http://gpc.edu/~pgore/geology/geo102/precamb.htm Precambrian life]". Georgia Perimeter College Clarkston. Retrieved on [[2007-10-07]].</ref> A quite diverse collection of soft-bodied forms is known from a variety of locations worldwide between 542 and 600 Ma. These are referred to as ''[[Ediacaran biota|Ediacaran or Vendian biota]]''. Hard-shelled creatures appeared toward the end of that timespan.

A very diverse collection of animal forms appeared around 544 Ma, starting in the latest Precambrian with a poorly understood ''[[small shelly fauna]]'' and ending in the very early Cambrian with a very diverse, and quite modern ''[[Burgess shale|Burgess fauna]]'', the rapid radiation of forms called the ''[[Cambrian explosion]]'' of life.

== Life during Phanerozoic ==

===Paleozoic life===
{{Main|Paleozoic}}
[[Image:Asaphiscuswheelerii.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Trilobites]] flourished throughout the lower Paleozoic era until becoming extinct in the [[Permian]] period]]
The Paleozoic spanned from roughly 542 [[mya (unit)|mya]] to roughly 251 mya ([[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]] 2004).
The Paleozoic covers the time from the first appearance of abundant, hard-shelled animal [[fossil]]s to the time when the [[continent]]s were beginning to be dominated by large, relatively sophisticated reptiles and complex [[fern]]s and [[seed plant]]s. The lower (oldest) boundary was classically set at the first appearance of creatures known as [[trilobite]]s and [[archeocyathid]]s. The upper (youngest) boundary is set at a major [[extinction event]] 300 million years later, known as the [[Permian extinction]]. Modern practice sets the older boundary at the first appearance of a distinctive [[trace fossil]] called ''[[Trichophycus pedum]]''.

At the start of the era, animal life was confined to [[Ediacaran biota|Ediacaran fauna]].
There is some evidence that simple life may already have invaded the land at the start of the Paleozoic, but substantial plants did not take to the land until the [[Ordovician]], followed by animals in the Silurian. Neither group thrived on land until the Devonian. Although primitive [[vertebrate]]s are known near the start of the Paleozoic, animal forms were dominated by [[invertebrate]]s until the mid-Paleozoic. [[Fish]] populations exploded in the Devonian. During the late Paleozoic, great [[forest]]s of primitive plants thrived on land forming the great [[coal]] beds of [[Europe]] and eastern [[North America]]. By the end of the era, the first large, sophisticated reptiles and the first modern plants ([[conifer]]s) had developed.<ref>Rieboldt, S. (November 2002).

===Mesozoic life===
{{Main|Mesozoic}}
The Mesozoic extended roughly from 251 [[Mya (unit)|Ma]] to 65 Ma ([[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]] 2004).
The extinction of nearly all animal species at the end of the [[Permian]] period allowed for the [[adaptive radiation|radiation]] of many new lifeforms.  In particular, the extinction of the large [[herbivore|herbivorous]] and [[carnivore|carnivorous]] [[dinocephalia]] left those [[ecological niche]]s empty. Some were filled by the surviving [[cynodont]]s and [[dicynodont]]s, the latter of which subsequently became extinct. [[Animal]] life during the Mesozoic was dominated, however, by large [[archosaur]]ian [[reptile]]s that appeared a few million years after the Permian extinction: [[dinosaur]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, and aquatic reptiles such as [[ichthyosaur]]s, [[plesiosaur]]s, and [[mosasaur]]s.<ref>"[http://www.fossilmuseum.net/Paleobiology/Mesozoic_Paleobiology.htm Mesozoic Era Paleobiology]". ''Fossil Museum''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-07]].</ref>

The climatic changes of the late Jurassic and Cretaceous provided for further adaptive radiation. The Jurassic was the height of archosaur diversity, and the first [[bird]]s and [[Eutheria|placental mammal]]s also appeared. [[Flowering plant|Angiosperms]] radiated sometime in the early Cretaceous, first in the [[tropics]], but the even temperature gradient allowed them to spread toward the poles throughout the period. By the end of the Cretaceous, angiosperms dominated tree floras in many areas, although some evidence suggests that [[biomass]] was still dominated by [[cycad]] and [[fern]]s until after the KT extinction.

Some have argued that [[insect]]s diversified with angiosperms because insect [[anatomy]], especially the [[mouth]] parts, seems particularly well-suited for flowering plants. However, all major insect mouth parts preceded angiosperms and insect diversification actually slowed when they arrived, so their anatomy originally must have been suited for some other purpose.

As the temperatures in the seas increased, the larger animals of the early Mesozoic gradually began to disappear while smaller animals of all kinds, including [[lizard]]s, [[snake]]s, and perhaps the ancestor [[mammal]]s to [[primate]]s, evolved. The KT extinction exacerbated this trend. The large archosaurs became extinct, while birds and mammals thrived, as they do today.

=== Cenozoic life ===
{{Main|Cenozoic}}
The Cenozoic era covers the 65.5 million years since the [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event]].
The Cenozoic is the ''age of new life''. During this era, mammals diverged from a few small, simple, generalized forms into a diverse collection of terrestrial, marine, and flying animals.
As the [[dinosaur]]s perished at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period, the [[mammal]]s took center stage. The mammals are the largest land animals of the Era, as the dinosaurs had been during the Mesozoic.<ref name=cenlifefm>{{cite web

The fossil record provides us with a few cases of exceptional preservation around the end of this explosion, with famous units such as the [[Burgess shale]] offering a glimpse into a bustling yet strikingly different world, in stark contrast to the microbe-dominated seas of just 80 million years before.

The Cambrian explosion has generated extensive scientific debate. The seemingly rapid appearance of fossils in the "Primordial Strata" was noted as early as the mid 19th century;<ref name=Buckland1841>{{cite book

The Cambrian explosion has proven difficult to study, partly because of the problems involved in matching up rocks of the same age across disparate [[continent]]s.  It should be borne in mind that absolute [[radiometric dating|radiometric]] dates for much of the Cambrian, obtained by detailed analysis of radioactive elements contained within rocks,  have only rather recently become available<ref>e.g. {{cite journal

===Ordovician-Silurian extinction events===
{{Main|Ordovician-Silurian extinction events}}
[[Image:Extinction Intensity.svg|thumb|300px|right|The Ordovician-Silurian extinction event, labeled "End O" here.]]

The extinctions occurred approximately 444&ndash;447 million years ago and mark the boundary between the [[Ordovician Period|Ordovician]] and the following [[Silurian Period]]s.  During this extinction event, which may have been composed of several distinct closely spaced events, there were several marked changes in biologically responsive [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]] [[isotope]]s, which may indicate separate events or particular phases within one event. 

At that time most complex [[multicellular organism]]s lived in the sea, and around 100 marine [[Scientific classification|families]] became extinct, covering about 49 percent<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rohde & Muller|year=2005|title=Cycles in Fossil Diversity|journal=Nature|volume=434|pages=208&ndash;210|id={{doi|10.1038/nature03339}}|issue=7030}}</ref> of [[genus|genera]] of [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] (a more reliable estimate than species). The [[brachiopod]]s and [[bryozoan]]s were decimated, along with many of the [[trilobite]], [[conodont]] and [[graptolite]] families.

Statistical analysis of marine losses at this time suggests that the decrease in diversity was caused more by a sharp increase in extinctions  than by a decrease in [[speciation]].<ref name=Bambach>{{Citation | last=Bambach | first=R.K. | last2=Knoll | first2=A.H. | last3=Wang | first3=S.C. | title=Origination, extinction, and mass depletions of marine diversity | journal=Paleobiology | volume=30 | issue=4 | pages=522&ndash;542 | date=December 2004 | url=http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&issn=0094-8373&volume=30&page=522 | accessdate=[[2007-10-07]]}}</ref>

it is harder to produce such detailed statistics for land, river, swamp and lake environments because good Permian-Triassic rock sequences from terrestrial environments are extremely rare (the [[Karoo|Karoo basin]] is by far the best). 

Even so, there is enough evidence to indicate that:
* Over two-thirds of terrestrial [[amphibian]], [[sauropsid]] ("reptile") and [[therapsid]] ("mammal-like reptile") [[Family (biology)|families]] became extinct. 
* Large herbivores suffered the heaviest losses. 
* All Permian [[anapsid]] reptiles died out except the [[Procolophonidae|procolophonid]]s ([[testudines]] have anapsid skulls but are most often thought to have evolved later, from [[diapsid]] ancestors).<ref>Maxwell, W.

===Late Devonian extinction===
{{Main|Late Devonian extinction}}
The Devonian extinction crisis primarily affected the marine community, and selectively affected shallow warm-water organisms rather than cool-water organisms. The most important group to be affected by this extinction event were the reef-builders of the great Devonian reef-systems, including the [[stromatoporoid]]s, and the [[rugosa|rugose]] and [[tabulate coral]]s. The reef system collapse was so severe that major reef-building (effected by new families of carbonate-excreting organisms, the modern scleractinian  corals) did not recover until the Mesozoic era. 

The late Devonian crash in [[biodiversity]] was more drastic than the familiar extinction event that closed the [[Cretaceous]]: a recent survey (McGhee 1996) estimates that 22 percent of all the ''[[Family (biology)|families]]'' of marine animals (largely [[invertebrate]]s) were eliminated, the category of families offering a broad range of real structural diversity.<ref>McGhee, George R., Jr, 1996. ''The Late Devonian Mass Extinction: the Frasnian/Famennian Crisis'' (Columbia University Press) [http://www.americanscientist.org/template/BookReviewTypeDetail/assetid/28695 reviewed by Sherman J. Suter, Smithsonian]</ref> Some 57 percent of the [[Genus|genera]] went extinct, and&mdash;the estimate most likely to be adjusted&mdash;at least 75 percent of the species did not survive into the following [[Carboniferous]]. The estimates of species loss depend on surveys of marine taxa that are perhaps not well enough known to assess their true rate of losses, and for the Devonian it is not easy to allow for possible effects of differential preservation and [[sampling bias]]es. Amongst the severely affected marine groups were the [[brachiopod]]s, [[trilobite]]s, [[ammonite]]s, [[conodont]]s, and [[acritarch]]s, as well as [[Agnatha|jawless fish]], and all [[placoderm]]s. Freshwater species, including our [[tetrapod]] ancestors, were less affected.

===Triassic-Jurassic extinction event===
{{Main|Triassic-Jurassic extinction event}}
[[Image:Triassic-jurassic boundary.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ranges of families tetrapods through the Triassic and Early Jurassic.]]

The Triassic-Jurassic extinction event occurred 200 million years ago and is one of the major [[extinction event]]s of the [[Phanerozoic]] eon, profoundly affecting life on land and in the oceans.  Twenty percent of all marine families and all large [[Crurotarsi]] (non-dinosaurian [[archosaur]]s), some remaining [[therapsid]]s, and many of the large [[amphibia]]ns were wiped out.  At least half of the species now known to have been living on Earth at that time went extinct.  This event opened an [[ecological niche]] allowing the [[dinosaur]]s to assume the dominant roles in the [[Jurassic]] period.<ref name=Bambach/>

===Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event===
{{Main|Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event}}
[[Image:Impact event.jpg|thumb|300px|Artist's impression of a major impact event. The collision between Earth and an [[asteroid]] a few kilometers in diameter may release as much energy as several million nuclear weapons detonating.]]
The Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event was the catastrophic mass [[extinction]] of extant animal species in a comparatively short period of time, approximately 65.5 [[mya (unit)|million years ago]].

Most, if not all, non-avian [[dinosaur]]s became extinct during or possibly a few years after the event.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Favstovsky, D.E.; P.M. Sheehan|date=2005|url=http://www.gsajournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1130%2F1052-5173%282005%29015%3C4%3ATEOTDI%3E2.0.CO%3B2 |title=The extinction of the dinosaurs in North America|journal=GSA Today|volume=15|issue=3|pages=4–10|accessdate=2007-10-07|doi=10.1130/1052-5173(2005)015%3C4:TEOTDI%3E2.0.CO;2}}</ref> Non-avian dinosaur fossils are not found later than the K–T boundary, except for a few controversial exceptions.  Many other groups of animals and plants, including [[mosasaur]]s, [[plesiosaur]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, and some [[invertebrate]]s, also became extinct at the K–T boundary. The event marks the end of the [[Mesozoic]] Era, and the beginning of the [[Cenozoic]] Era.

Most of the extinctions occurred in a relatively short time because extensive weather changes reduced [[photosynthesis]], thereby decreasing the amount of plant material available to [[herbivore|herbivorous animals]].  This change in food supply caused a massive disruption in Earth's ecology.

Despite the severity of the K–T extinction event, there was significant variability in the rate of extinction of different classes of organisms.  Organisms which depended on [[photosynthesis]] became extinct or suffered heavy losses due to reduced [[sunlight]].  Photosynthesizing organisms, from [[plankton]] (e.g. [[coccolithophorids]]) to land [[plant]]s, formed the primary part of the food chain in the late Cretaceous.  [[Herbivores|Herbivorous]] animals, which depended on plants and plankton as their food, died out as their food sources became scarce; consequently, top [[predators]] such as ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' also began dying.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wilf, P.; K.R.

Animals which built [[calcium carbonate]] shells (for example, coccolithophorids along with many groups of [[mollusc]]s, including [[ammonite]]s, [[rudist]]s, [[fresh water]] [[snail]]s and [[mussel]]s), as well as organisms whose [[food chain]] depended on these [[calcium carbonate]] shell builders, became extinct or suffered heavy losses. For example, it is thought that ammonites were the principal food of [[mosasaur]]s, a group of giant marine reptiles that became extinct at the boundary.<ref name="Kauffman">{{cite journal| author =Kauffman, E. |title =Mosasaur Predation on Upper Cretaceous Nautiloids and Ammonites from the United States Pacific Coast | journal =Palaios| volume =19| issue =1| pages =96&ndash;100| publisher =Society for Sedimentary Geology| date =2004| url=http://palaios.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/reprint/19/1/96|format=PDF | doi =10.1669/0883-1351(2004)019%3C0096:MPOUCN%3E2.0.CO;2|accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref>

Most omnivores, insectivores and [[carrion]]-eaters appear to have survived quite well. At the end of the Cretaceous there seem to have been no purely herbivorous or carnivorous mammals. Many mammals, and the birds which survived the extinction, fed on [[insect]]s, [[larva]]e, [[worm]]s, snails, etc., which in turn fed on dead plant matter. They may have survived the collapse of plant-based food chains because they lived in "[[Detritus (biology)|detritus]]-based" food chains.<ref name="SheehanHansen">{{cite journal| last =Sheehan| first =P.| coauthors =T.A.

In [[stream]] [[Biocoenosis|communities]] few groups of animals became extinct. Stream communities tend to rely less on food from living plants and more on detritus that washes in from land. This may have buffered them from extinction.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Major extinctions of land-dwelling vertebrates at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary, eastern Montana|author=Sheehan, P.M.; D.E.

Extinction was more severe among animals living in the [[Pelagic zone|water column]], than among animals living on or in the sea floor. Animals in the water column are almost entirely dependent on [[primary production]] from living phytoplankton, while many animals living on or in the [[ocean floor]] feed on detritus or can switch to detritus feeding.<ref name="MacLeod">{{cite journal|author=MacLeod, N.; P.F.

The largest air-breathing survivors, [[crocodilian]]s and [[champsosaur]]s, were semi-aquatic. Modern crocodilians can live as scavengers and can survive for months without food. Modern crocodilian young are small, grow slowly, and feed largely on invertebrates and dead organisms or fragments of organisms for their first few years. This has been linked to crocodilian survival at the end of the Cretaceous.<ref name="SheehanHansen"/>

===Holocene extinction event===
{{Main|Holocene extinction event}}
[[Image:ExtinctDodoBird.jpeg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Dodo]], a bird of Mauritius, became extinct during the mid-late [[17th century]] after humans destroyed the [[forest]]s where the birds made their homes and introduced animals that ate their eggs.]]
The Holocene extinction event is a name customarily given to the widespread, ongoing [[mass extinction]] of [[species]] during the modern [[Holocene]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]]. The large number of extinctions span numerous families of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s  including [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s and [[arthropod]]s; a sizeable fraction of these extinctions are occurring in the [[rainforest]]s.  Because the rate of this [[extinction event]] appears to be much more rapid than the "Big Five" mass extinctions, it is also known as the ''Sixth Extinction''.  Since 1500 AD, 784 extinctions have been documented by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]].<ref>(2006). "[http://www.iucn.org/bookstore/HTML-books/Red%20List%202004/completed/Executive%20Summary.html Executive Summary: The Status of Globally Threatened Species]". ''The World Conservation Union. Retrieved on [[2007-10-07]].</ref>  However, since most extinctions are likely to go undocumented, scientists estimate that during the last century, between 20,000 and two million species have become extinct, but the precise total cannot be determined more accurately within the limits of present knowledge.  Up to 140,000 species per year (based on [[Species-area theory]])<ref>Pimm, S.L.; G.J. Russell, J.L. Gittleman, T.M. Brooks (1995). ''The Future of Biodiversity'', Science 269: 347&ndash;50.</ref> may be the present rate of extinction based upon upper bound estimating.

In broad usage, the Holocene extinction event includes the notable disappearance of large [[mammal]]s, known as [[megafauna]], by the end of the [[last ice age]] 9,000 to 13,000 years ago.  Such disappearances have been considered as either a response to climate change, a result of the [[overpopulation|proliferation]] of [[modern human]]s, or both.  These extinctions, occurring near the [[Pleistocene]] / Holocene boundary, are sometimes referred to as the ''[[New World Pleistocene Extinctions|Pleistocene Extinction Event]]'' or Ice Age extinction event.  However the Holocene extinction event continues through the events of the past several millennia and includes the present time.

The observed rate of extinction has accelerated dramatically in the last 50 years, to a pace greater than the rate seen during the Big Five.  There is no general agreement on whether to consider more recent extinctions as a distinct event or merely part of a single escalating process.  Only during these most recent parts of the extinction have plants also suffered large losses. Overall, the Holocene extinction event is most significantly characterised by the presence of man-made driving factors and its very short [[geological timescale]] (tens to thousands of years) compared to most other extinction events.

Significantly, the rate of species extinctions at present is estimated at 100 to 1000 times "background" or average extinction rates in the [[evolution]]ary time scale of planet [[Earth]].<ref>Lawton, J.H.; R.M.

===Prokaryote===
{{Main|Prokaryote}}
It is generally accepted that the [[origin of life|first living cells]] were some form of prokaryote and may have developed out of [[protobionts]]. Fossilized prokaryotes approximately 3.5 billion years old have been discovered, and prokaryotes are the most successful and abundant organism even today. In contrast the eukaryote only appeared between approximately 1.7 and 2.2 billion years ago.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Eukaryotes with no mitochondria|author=Cavalier-Smith, T.|date=1987|journal=Nature|volume=326|pages=332&ndash;3|doi=10.1038/326332a0}}</ref>  While Earth is the only known place in the universe where life exist, some have suggested structures within a Martian [[meteorite]] should be interpreted as fossil prokaryotes; this is open to considerable debate and skepticism. 

Prokaryotes diversified greatly throughout their long existence. The metabolism of prokaryotes is far more varied than that of [[eukaryote]]s, leading to many highly distinct types of prokaryotes.  For example, in addition to using [[photosynthesis]] or organic compounds for energy like eukaryotes do, prokaryotes may obtain energy from inorganic chemicals such as [[hydrogen sulfide]].

===Eukaryote===
{{Main|Eukaryote}}
[[Image:Fiveking.PNG|thumb|right|175px|The original, now outdated, five-kingdom system.]]
The origin of the eukaryotic cell was a milestone in the evolution of life, since they include all complex cells and almost all multi-cellular organisms. The timing of this series of events is hard to determine; Knoll (1992) suggests they developed approximately 1.6 to 2.1 billion years ago.<ref>{{cite journal

[[rRNA]] trees constructed during the 1980s and 1990s left most eukaryotes in an unresolved "crown" group (not technically a true [[crown group|crown]]), which was usually divided by the form of the mitochondrial cristae.  The few groups that lack mitochondria branched separately and so the absence was believed to be primitive, but this is now considered an artifact of [[long branch attraction]] and they are known to have lost them secondarily.

Trees based on [[actin]] and other molecules have painted a different and more complete picture.  Most eukaryotes are now included in several supergroups:

Several authorities recognize two larger clades, the [[unikont]]s and the [[bikont]]s, the unikonts deriving from an ancestral uniflagellar organism, and the bikonts deriving from an ancestral biflagellate.  In this system, the opisthokonts and amoebozoans are considered unikonts, and the rest are considered bikonts.  The chromists and alveolates may be part of a larger group that is ancestrally photosynthetic, called the [[chromalveolate]]s, but this remains contentious.  Some small protist groups have not been related to any of these supergroups, in particular the [[centrohelid]]s.
Eukaryotes are closely related to [[Archaea]], at least in terms of nuclear DNA and genetic machinery, and are placed by some, along with the Archaea, in the clade [[Neomura]].  In other respects, such as membrane composition, they are similar to [[Bacteria|eubacteria]].  Three main explanations for this have been proposed:

* Eukaryotes resulted from the complete fusion of two or more cells, the cytoplasm forming from a eubacterium and the nucleus from an archaeon ([[Viral Eukaryogenesis|alternatively]] a virus).
* Eukaryotes developed from Archaea, and acquired their eubacterial characteristics from the proto-mitochondrion.
* Eukaryotes and Archaea developed separately from a modified eubacterium.

The final hypothesis is currently the most accepted.
The origin of the endomembrane system and mitochondria are also disputed.  The ''phagotrophic hypothesis'' states the membranes originated with the development of endocytosis and later specialized; mitochondria were acquired by ingestion, like plastids.  The ''syntrophic hypothesis'' states that the proto-eukaryote relied on the proto-mitochondrion for food, and so ultimately grew to surround it; the membranes originate later, in part thanks to mitochondrial genes (the [[hydrogen hypothesis]] is one particular version).

===Archaea===
{{Main|Archaea}}
The Archaea are a major group of [[microorganism]]s. Archaea are similar to other [[prokaryote]]s in most aspects of [[Cell (biology)|cell]] structure and [[metabolism]]. However, their genetic [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[translation (genetics)|translation]]&mdash;the two central processes in [[molecular biology]]&mdash;do not show many typical bacterial features, and are in many aspects similar to those of [[eukaryote]]s. For instance, archaean translation uses eukaryotic-like initiation and elongation factors, and their transcription involves [[TATA Binding Protein]]s and TFIIB as in eukaryotes. Many archaeal tRNA and rRNA genes harbor unique archaeal [[introns]] which are neither like eukaryotic introns, nor like bacterial (type I and type II etc which can "home") introns.

Archaea were identified in 1977 by [[Carl Woese]] and [[George E. Fox]] as being a separate branch based on their separation from other prokaryotes on 16S [[rRNA]] [[phylogenetic tree]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Woese, C.; G. Fox | title = Phylogenetic structure of the prokaryotic domain: the primary kingdoms | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 74 | issue = 11 | pages = 5088&ndash;90 | year = 1977 | pmid = 270744}}</ref> These two groups were originally named the Archaebacteria and Eubacteria, treated as [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]s or subkingdoms, which Woese and Fox termed Urkingdoms. Woese argued that they represented fundamentally different branches of living things. He later renamed the groups Archaea and [[Bacteria]] to emphasize this, and argued that together with [[Eukaryota|Eukarya]] they compose [[three-domain system|three Domains]] of living organisms.<ref>{{cite journal | author =Woese, C.R.; O. Kandler, M.L.

The Archaea should not be confused with the [[geological]] term ''[[Archean]] eon'', also known as the ''Archeozoic era''. This refers to the primordial period of [[Earth]] history when Archaea and Bacteria were the only [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] organisms living on the planet.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Altermann, W.; J.

== Evolution of sex ==
{{Main|Evolution of sex}}

The evolution of sex is a major puzzle. The first [[fossil]]ized evidence of sexually reproducing [[organism]]s is from [[eukaryote]]s of the [[Stenian]] period, about 1.2 to 1 billion years ago with [[DNA]] forming 3.5 to 4.6 billion years.<ref>{{cite web | last = Orgel | first = L.E. | url = http://proxy.arts.uci.edu/~nideffer/Hawking/early_proto/orgel.html | title = The Origin of Life on the Earth | work = Scientific American | accessdate = 2007-01-03 }}</ref> Sexual reproduction is the primary method of reproduction for the vast majority of visible organisms, including almost all [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s. [[Bacterial conjugation]], the transfer of [[DNA]] between two [[bacteria]], is often mistakenly confused with sexual reproduction, because the mechanics are similar.

A major question is why sexual reproduction persists when [[parthenogenesis]] appears in some ways to be a superior form of [[reproduction]]. Contemporary evolutionary thought proposes some explanations. It may be  due to selection pressure on the [[clade]] itself—the ability for a population to radiate more rapidly due to a changing environment through sexual recombination than parthenogenesis allows. Alternatively, sexual reproduction may allow for the 'ratcheting' of evolutionary speed as one clade competes with another for a limited resource.

Organisms need to replicate their genetic material in an efficient and reliable manner. The necessity to repair genetic damage is one of the leading theories explaining the origin of sexual reproduction. [[Diploid]] individuals can repair a mutated section of its DNA via [[homologous recombination]], since there are two copies of the gene in the cell and one copy is presumed to be undamaged. A mutation in an [[haploid]] individual, on the other hand, is more likely to become resident, as the [[DNA repair]] machinery has no way of knowing what the original undamaged sequence was.<ref name="dna-repair">{{cite journal | author = Bernstein, H.; H. Byerly, F. Hopf, R. Michod | title = Origin of sex | journal = J Theor Biol | volume = 110 | issue = 3 | pages = 323&ndash;51 | year = 1984 | id = PMID 6209512}}</ref>  The most primitive form of sex may have been one organism with damaged DNA replicating an undamaged strand from a similar organism in order to repair itself.<ref name="tatiana">{{cite book | author = Judson, O. | title = Dr. Tatiana's sex advice to all creation | publisher = Metropolitan Books | location = New York | year = 2002 | id = ISBN 0-8050-6331-5 | pages =233&ndash;4}}</ref>

Another theory is that sexual reproduction originated from [[Selfish DNA|selfish parasitic genetic elements]] that exchange genetic material (that is: copies of their own genome) for their transmission and propagation. In some organisms, sexual reproduction has been shown to enhance the spread of parasitic genetic elements (e.g. yeast, filamentous fungi).<ref name="hickey">{{cite journal | author = Hickey, D. | title = Selfish DNA: a sexually-transmitted nuclear parasite | journal = Genetics | volume = 101 | issue = 3&ndash;4 | pages = 519&ndash;31 | year = 1982 | id = PMID 6293914}}</ref>  [[Bacterial conjugation]], a form of genetic exchange that some sources describe as sex, is not a form of reproduction.  However, it does support the selfish genetic element theory, as it is propagated through such a "selfish gene", the [[F-plasmid]].<ref name="tatiana"/>

A third theory is that sex evolved as a form of cannibalism.  One primitive organism ate another one, but rather than completely digesting it, some of the 'eaten' organism's DNA was incorporated into the 'eater' organism.<ref name="tatiana"/>

A theory states that sexual reproduction evolved from ancient [[haloarchaea]] through a combination of [[jumping genes]], and swapping [[plasmid]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Extreme Microbes | first=S. | last=DasSarma | contribution=Extreme Microbes | work=American Scientist | year=2007 | volume=95 | pages= page 224&ndash;31 }}</ref>

A comprehensive ''origin of sex as vaccination'' theory proposes that eukaryan sex-as-syngamy (fusion sex) arose from prokaryan unilateral sex-as-infection when infected hosts began swapping nuclearized genomes containing coevolved, vertically transmitted symbionts that provided protection against horizontal superinfection by more virulent symbionts. Sex-as-meiosis (fission sex) then evolved as a host strategy to uncouple (and thereby emasculate) the acquired symbiont genomes.<ref name="sterrer">{{cite journal | author = Sterrer, W. | title = On the origin of sex as vaccination | journal =  Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 216 | pages = 387&ndash;96 | year = 2002}}</ref>
