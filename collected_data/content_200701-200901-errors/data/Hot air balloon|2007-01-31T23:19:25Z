'''Hot air balloons''' are the oldest successful human [[flight]] technology, dating back to the [[Montgolfier brothers]]' invention in [[Annonay]], [[France]] in 1783. The first flight carrying humans was made on [[November 21]], [[1783]], in [[Paris]] by [[Pilâtre de Rozier]] and the [[Marquis d'Arlandes]]. Hot air balloons that can be propelled through the air rather than just being carried along by the [[wind]] are known as [[airship]]s or, more specifically, [[thermal airship]]s.

Attractive aspects of [[balloon (aircraft)|ballooning]] include the exceptional quiet (except when the propane burners are firing), the lack of any perceptible feeling of movement and the birds-eye view. Since the balloon moves with the wind, the passengers feel absolutely no wind, except for brief periods during the flight when the balloon climbs or descends into air currents of different direction or speed.

A hot air balloon consists of a bag called the [[envelope (lighter-than-air-craft)|envelope]] that is capable of containing hot air. Suspended beneath is the [[gondola]] or [[wicker]] basket (in certain, long distance or high altitude balloons, a [[capsule]]) which carries a source of heat capable of producing a sufficient temperature gradient between the air inside the envelope and the surrounding air mass to give enough lift to keep the balloon and its passengers aloft. Unlike [[gas balloon]]s, the envelope does not have to be sealed at the bottom since the rising hot air only exerts pressure on the upper hemisphere of the balloon to provide lift. In today's sports balloons the envelope is generally made from nylon fabric and the mouth of the balloon (closest to the burner flame) is made from fire resistant material such as [[Nomex]]. 

Recently, balloon envelopes have been made in fantastic shapes, such as hot dogs, rocket ships, and the shapes of commercial products.

==History==
Unmanned hot air balloons are mentioned in [[China|Chinese]] history.
[[Zhuge Liang]] in the [[Three Kingdoms]] era, Shu Kingdom, used airborne lanterns for military signaling.
These lanterns are known as Kongming lanterns (孔明灯).

There is also some speculation that hot air balloons were used by the Nazca Indians of Peru some 1500 years ago as a tool for designing [[Nazca lines|vast drawings on the Nazca plain]].[http://www.nott.com/Pages/projects.php]

===First recorded flight===
[[image:Montgolfier Balloon.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A model of the Montgolfier brothers balloon at the [[London Science Museum]]]]
The first clearly recorded instances of balloons capable of carrying passengers used hot air to obtain [[buoyancy]] and were built by the brothers Josef and Etienne [[Montgolfier]] in Annonay, France. They were from a family of paper manufacturers who had noticed the ash rising in fires. After experimenting with unmanned balloons and flights with animals, the first balloon flight with humans on board took place on [[ October 19]] [[1783]] with the physician [[Pilâtre de Rozier]], the manufacture manager, [[Jean-Baptiste Réveillon]] and [[Giroud de Villette]], at the [[Folie Titon]] in actual Paris. Officially, the first fly was 1 month later, [[21 November]] [[1783]]. [[King Louis XVI]] had originally decreed that condemned criminals would be the first pilots, but a young physicist named [[Pilâtre de Rozier]] and the [[Marquis Francois d'Arlandes]] successfully petitioned for the honor. The first hot air balloons were basically cloth bags (sometimes lined with paper) with a smoky fire built on a grill attached to the bottom.  They had a tendency to catch fire and be destroyed upon landing.

===Military use===
The first military use of aircraft took place during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], when the French used a tethered Hydrogen balloon to observe the movements of the Austrian army during the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)]]. Hot air balloons were employed during the [[American Civil War]]. Though the military balloons used by the [[Union Army Balloon Corps]] under the command of Prof. [[Thaddeus S. C. Lowe]] were limp silk envelopes inflated with coke gas or hydrogen, the [[Confederate Army]] did attempt to counter with a rigid Montgolfier style hot air, or "hot smoke balloon." Captain John R. Bryant inflated his rigid cotton balloon with a fire of oil-soaked pine cones. The balloon was soon captured by Union forces as the Confederate's techniques of balloon handling were not competent.

===Modern revival===
The first modern hot air balloon was designed and built in 1960 by [[Ed Yost]]. He made the first free flight of such an aircraft in [[Bruning, Nebraska|Bruning]], [[Nebraska]] on [[22 October]] [[1960]].  Initially equipped with a plastic envelope and kerosene fuel, Yost's designs rapidly moved onto using a modified propane powered "weed burner" to heat the air and lightweight nylon fabric for the envelope material.

Most of the giant [[jettison|jettisonable]] [[propane]] [[fuel tank]]s are no longer attached. One still hangs in front of the two-man sealed pressurized capsule. The flight holds the distance record for a hot air balloon.]]

===Today===
Today, hot air balloons are used primarily for recreation. There are some 7,000 hot air balloons operating in the United States.

Hot air balloons are able to fly to extremely high altitudes. On [[November 26]], [[2005]], Vijaypat Singhania set the world altitude record for highest hot air balloon flight, reaching  21,290 meters (69,852 feet). He took off from downtown [[Bombay]], [[India]] and landed 240 km (150 miles) south in [[Panchale]]. The previous record of 19,811 meters (64,980 ft) had been set by [[Per Lindstrand]] on [[June 6]], [[1988]] in [[Plano, Texas]]. However, like all registered aircraft, oxygen is needed for all crew and passengers for any flight that reaches and exceeds an altitude of 12,500 feet.

The furthest that a hot air balloon has ever been flown is 7,671.91 km. On January 15, 1991, the ''Virgin Pacific Flyer'' balloon completed the longest flight in a hot air balloon when [[Per Lindstrand]] (born in [[Sweden]], but resident in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]) and [[Richard Branson]] of the UK flew from [[Japan]] to Northern [[Canada]]. 

With a volume of 74,000 m³ (2,600,000 ft³), the balloon envelope was the largest ever built for a hot air craft. Designed to fly in the trans-oceanic [[jetstream]]s the ''Pacific Flyer'' recorded the highest ground speed for a manned balloon at 245 mph (394 km/h).

The longest duration hot air balloon flight ever made is 50 hours and 38 minutes made by 
Michio Kanda and Hirosuke Tekezawa of [[Japan]] on January 2, 1997.[http://records.fai.org/balloons/current.asp?id1=ax&id3=3&id2=1]

==Construction and theory of operation ==
[[image:yellow.balloon.inflation.arp.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A hot air balloon is partially inflated with cold air from a petrol-driven fan, before the propane burners are used for final inflation.]]
A hot air balloon for manned flight uses a single layered, fabric gas bag (lifting "envelope"), with an opening at the bottom called the mouth or throat. Attached to the envelope is a basket, or gondola, for carrying the passengers. The basket is usually made of wicker and ratan, but can be made of aluminum. Mounted above the basket and centered in the mouth is the "burner" which injects a flame into the envelope, heating the air within. The heater or burner is fueled by [[propane]], a liquefied gas stored in pressure vessels, similar to high pressure [[forklift]] cylinders.

===The envelope===
Modern hot air balloons are usually made of light-weight and strong synthetic fabrics such as [[ripstop nylon]], or [[dacron]] (a [[polyester]]).<ref name="eballoon">{{cite web
| url = http://www.eballoon.org/balloon/envelope.html
| title = eballoon.org
| accessdate = 2006-12-21}}</ref> During the manufacturing process, the material is cut into panels and sewn together, along with structural load tapes (webbing) that carry the weight of the gondola or basket. Vertical rows of panels are referred to as [[gore]]s due to their triangular shape. Envelopes can have as few as 16 gores or as many as 24 or more.<ref name="Head">{{cite web
| url = http://home.att.net/~headballoons/second.htm
| title = Head Balloons
| accessdate = 2007-01-12}}</ref> The use of more gores usually means a smoother shape.

The fabric (or at least part of it, the top 1/3 for example) may be coated with a sealer, such as [[silicone]] or [[polyurethane]], to make it impermeable to air.<ref name="Cameron">{{cite web
| url = http://www.cameronballoons.com/hyperlast.html
| title = Cameron Balloons Hyperlast
| accessdate = 2006-12-21}}</ref> It is often the degredation of this coating and the corresponding loss of impermiability that ends the effective life of an envelope, not weakening of the fabric itself. Heat, moisture, and mechanical wear-and-tear during set up and pack up are the primary causes of degredation. Once an envelope becomes too porous to fly, it may be retired and used as a 'rag bag': cold inflated and opened for children to run through.

Envelopes often have a crown ring at their very top. This is a hoop of smooth metal, usually aluminum and approximately 1 foot in diameter, to which vertical load tapes attach.

===Envelope sizes===
A range of envelope sizes is available. The smallest, one-person, basket-less balloons (called "[[Hopper balloon|Hoppers]]" or "[[Cloudhopper]]s") have less than 1,000 cubic meters (35,000 ft³) of envelope volume. At the other end of the scale are the balloons used by large commercial sightseeing operations that carry well over two dozen people and have envelope volumes of up to 15,000 cubic meters (600,000 ft³). However, most balloons are roughly 2,500 cubic meters (100,000 ft³) and carry 3 to 4 people.

===Generating lift===
[[Image:Cloudhoppers.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A pair of Hopper balloons.]]
Raising the air temperature inside the envelope makes it lighter than the surrounding (ambient) air. This causes the balloon and its payload to rise. The amount of lift (or [[buoyancy]]) provided by a hot air balloon depends primarily upon the difference between the temperature of the air inside the envelope and the temperature of the air outside the envelope. For most envelopes made of nylon fabric, the maximum internal temperature is limited to approximately 120 °C (250 °F). It should be noted that the melting point of nylon is significantly higher than these maximum operating temperature — about 230 °C (450 °F). However the lower temperatures are generally used because the higher the temperature, the more quickly the strength of the nylon fabric degrades over time. With a maximum operating temperature of 120 °C, balloon envelopes can generally be flown for between 400 and 500 hours before the fabric needs to be replaced. Many balloon pilots operate their envelopes at temperatures significantly below the maximum in order to extend the longevity of their envelope fabric.

For typical atmospheric conditions, a hot air balloon requires about 3 cubic meters of envelope volume in order to lift 1 kilogram (50 ft³/lb).  The precise amount of lift provided depends not only upon the internal temperature mentioned above, but the external temperature, altitude above sea level, and humidity of the surrounding air.
On a hot day, the balloon cannot be loaded as much as on a cool day, because the temperature required for launch will exceed the maximum sustainable for nylon envelope fabric.

In the lower atmosphere, the lift provided by a hot air balloon decreases about 3% for each 1,000 meters (1% per 1,000 ft) of altitude gained.

====Hybrids====
The [[Rozier]] type of hybrid balloon, called after its creator, Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier, has separate cell for helium as well as a cone below for hot air (as is used in a hot air balloon) to heat the helium at night. 

===Control===
The direction of flight depends on the wind, but the altitude of the balloon can be controlled by changing the temperature of the air inside the envelope. 

====Delayed response====
One of the tricks involved in flying a balloon is learning to deal with the delayed response. To slow or stop a descent requires the pilot to light the burner. This sends hot combustion exhaust through the mouth into the envelope where it expands and forces some cooler air out of the mouth. This lightens the total weight of the system and increases its buoyancy, but not immediately. From the time that the burner is lit until the balloon slows or stops its descent can take 30 seconds or more, depending on its rate of decent and how cold it has become. This delay requires a great deal of anticipation on the part of the pilot.

====Vents====
[[Image:Hot air balloon interior.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The inside of a hot air balloon's envelope, seen from the gondola.]]
The top of the balloon usually has a vent of some sort.  The most common type of vent is  a disk-shaped flap of fabric called a ''parachute vent''. The fabric is connected around its edge to a set of "vent lines" that converge in the center.  (The arrangement of fabric and lines looks roughly like a parachute -- thus the name.) These "vent lines" are themselves connected to a control line that runs to the basket. A parachute vent is opened by pulling on the control line.  Once the control line is released, the pressure of the remaining hot air pushes the vent fabric back into place.  A parachute vent can be opened briefly while in flight to initiate a rapid descent. (Slower descents are initiated by allowing the air in the balloon to cool naturally.) The vent is pulled completely open to collapse the balloon after landing.

An older, and today less commonly used, style of vent is called a "Velcro-style" vent.  This too is a disk of fabric at the top of the balloon.  However, rather than having a set of "vent lines" that can repeatedly open and close the vent, the vent is secured by "hook and loop" fasteners (such as Velcro) and is only opened at the end of the flight.  Balloons equipped with a "Velcro-style" vent typically have a second "maneuvering vent" built into the side (as opposed to the top) of the balloon.

Some hot air balloons have ''turning vents'' which are side vents which, when opened, cause the balloon to rotate. Such vents are particularly useful for balloons with rectangular baskets in order to align the wider side of the basket for landing.

===Instrumentation===
A balloon may be outfitted with a variety of instruments to aid the pilot. These commonly include an [[altimeter]], a rate of climb (vertical speed) indicator, envelope (air) temperature, and ambient (air) temperature.<ref name="lindstrand">{{cite web
| url = http://www.lindstrand.com/instruments.php
| title = FLYTEC 3040 DIGITAL WIRELESS INSTRUMENT PACKAGE 
| accessdate = 2006-12-26}}</ref> A [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receiver can be useful to indicate ground speed (traditional aircraft air speed indicators would be useless) and direction.

==Flight techniques==
[[Image:Hot Air Balloons , Albuquerque , Ektachrome by Scott Williams.jpg|thumb|right|Early Morning Departures]]

Most hot air balloon launches are made during the cooler hours of the day, at dawn or two to three hours before sunset. At these times of day, the winds are typically light making for easier launch and landing of the balloon. Flying at these times also avoids [[thermal]]s, which are vertical air currents caused by ground heating that make it more difficult to control the balloon.  In the extreme, the downdrafts associated with strong thermals can exceed the ability of a balloon to climb and can thus force a balloon into the ground.

===Sequence===
====Set up====
[[Image:Ballon2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Hot air balloon being inflated by its propane burners prior to a dawn launch.]]
A hot air balloon flight starts with unpacking the balloon from its carrying bag. A [[gasoline]]-powered [[fan (implement)|fan]] is used to blow cold (outside) air into the envelope. The cold air partially inflates the balloon to establish its basic shape before the burner flame is aimed into the mouth heating the air inside. A crew member stationed opposite the mouth, holds a rope (crown line) tied to the apex (crown) of the envelope. The "crown-man" role is two fold, one is to prevent the envelope from excessive sway and two is to prevent the balloon rising until it is sufficiently buoyant. Once the balloon is upright, pilot and passengers climb into the basket. When the pilot is ready for launch, more heat is directed into the envelope and the balloon lifts off.

[[Image:Take_off.jpg|thumb|Setting up and taking off]]
The crew then pack up inflation equipment and follow the balloon with the retrieve vehicle (also called a chase vehicle)

====Flight====
During the flight, the pilot's only ability to steer the balloon is the ability to climb or descend into wind currents going different directions.  Thus, it is important for the pilot to determine what direction the wind is blowing at altitudes other than the balloon's altitude.  To do this, the pilot uses a variety of techniques.  For example, to determine wind directions beneath the balloon a pilot might simply spit or release a squirt of shaving cream and watch this indicator as it falls to determine where possible turns are (and their speed).  Pilots are also looking for other visual clues such as flags on flagpoles, smoke coming from chimneys, etc.  To determine wind directions above the balloon, the pilot will obtain a weather forecast prior to the flight which includes upper level wind forecasts.  The pilot will also send up a helium pilot balloon, known as a ''met-balloon'' in the UK and ''pibal'' in the USA, prior to launch to get information about what the wind is actually doing.  Another way to determine  actual wind directions is to watch other hot air balloons, which are the equivalent of a large ''met-balloon''.

=====Level Flight=====
The burner is designed to create enough heat to warm up the balloon quickly. It is most efficient only when wide open. There is no good way to maintain the exact temperature required to maintain equilibrium.

Add to that the fact that when a hot air balloon is not actively being heated, it is cooling off. This means that it is in perfect equalibrium only momentarily. The rest of the time it is either too warm or too cool and so either climbing or decending.

These two facts together mean that under most conditions level flight is anything but. The goal of the pilot is to light the burner at the right interval and for the right duration (a few seconds) to keep the balloon slowly drifting up and down about the desired altitude.

An exception is made when flying close to the ground, as in an approach to a landing. Then the burner may be lit for very short bursts at a much higher frequency, thus sacrificing efficiency for accuracy.

====Landing====
Most pilots try to perform as smooth a landing as possible. This becomes difficult if the air at ground level is moving at more than 5 mph or so. If the balloon is moving at this speed or more when it contacts the ground, the basket (which usually does not have wheels of any kind on the bottom) may drag for a bit or even tip over. Even the presence of ground crew may not help much. The combined weight (for an average passenger-carrying system) of
*the envelope: 250&nbsp;lbs, 113&nbsp;kg
*basket: 140&nbsp;lbs, 63.5&nbsp;kg
*burner: 50&nbsp;lbs, 22.7&nbsp;kg 
*3 fuel tanks with fuel: 3 * 135&nbsp;lbs = 405&nbsp;lbs, 184&nbsp;kg
*5 passengers: 5 * 150&nbsp;lbs each = 750&nbsp;lbs, 340&nbsp;kg
*the air in the envelope (100,000&nbsp;ft³ at 0.062&nbsp;lb/ft³ = 3.1&nbsp;tons, 2812&nbsp;kg)
can easily exceed the weight of a large automobile (total = 3.9&nbsp;tons, 3538&nbsp;kg).<ref name="Cameron" /> (It is best not to be on the downwind side of a landing balloon to avoid being pinned between it and a hard place.) Pilots can improve the situation by landing in a spot protected from the wind, such as behind a line of trees or in a small valley.

Once the balloon has landed, the envelope is deflated and detached from the basket. The envelope is then packed into its carrying bag. The burner and the basket are separated and all components are packed into the retrieve vehicle.

===Competition===

In competition, the pilots need to be able to read different wind directions at different altitudes. Balloon competitions are often called "races" but they're most often a test of accuracy, not speed. For most competitive balloon flights, the goal is to fly as close as possible to one or more exact points called "targets". Once a pilot has directed the balloon as close as possible to a target, a weighted marker with an identifying number written on it is dropped. The distance between a pilot's marker and that target determines his or her score. During some competitive flights, pilots will be required to fly to 5 or more targets before landing. To assist with navigation, topographic maps and GPS units are used.  Another common form of competition is the "Hare and Hound" race.  The Hare balloon takes off a set amount of time before the Hound balloons and typically flies with multiple altitude changes to make it more difficult for the chasing balloons to match its flight path.  After a set amount of flight time, the Hare will land and typically lay out a target cross for the Hounds to drop their weighted markers near.  As above, the distance between a pilot's marker and the target determines his or her score. 

Some experienced pilots are able to take a flight in one direction then rise to a different altitude to catch wind in a returning direction. With experience, luck, and the right conditions, some pilots are able to control a precision landing at the destination. On rare occasions, they may be able to return to the launch site at the end of the flight. This is sometimes called a box effect, usually when flying in valleys with drainage winds.

===Hazards===
The dangers of the sport include excessive (vertical or horizontal) speed during landing, mid-air collisions that may collapse the balloon, and colliding with high voltage power lines.  It is the last of these, contact with power lines, that poses the greatest danger.  One of the most common causes of serious ballooning accidents in the US is power line strikes.<ref> {{cite web
|url = http://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/SoftCart.exe/JOURNALS/FORENSIC/PAGES/2118.htm?E+mystore
|title = Rare Electrocution Due to Powerline Contact in a Hot-Air Balloon: Comparison with Fatalities from Blunt Trauma
|accessdate = 2007-01-16}}</ref> 
One reason for the high frequency of such incidents is the fact that pilots often attempt to land their balloons on or near roads in order to reduce the amount of off-road driving necessary to recover the balloon.  However, in most rural areas where balloons fly, roads usually have power lines running along them.

Of the 11 accidents involving fatalities recorded by the [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]] between 1997 and 2007, 4 involved contact with power lines, 3 involved falling after hanging onto the outside of a rising balloon, 3 involved striking an object on landing (boulder, wall, or tree), and 1 involved an equipment failure (an eyebolt).<ref> {{cite web
|url = http://ntsb.gov/ntsb/query.asp
|title = Fatal Balloon Accidents between Jan 1997 and Jan 2007
|accessdate = 2007-01-16}}</ref>

The recent advent of vertically aerodynamic sport balloons which can climb and descend at twice the rate of a conventional balloon (1500 ft/min as opposed to 700 ft/min) has significantly increased the danger posed by collision or accidental ground impact during competition. Many pilots have also reported strange aerodynamic performance during very aggressive climbs, such as greatly reduced air resistance at vertical speeds over +1500 ft/min, resulting in a sudden, unexpected acceleration. At present there is little research into high vertical-speed balloon flight to understand this phenomenon.

===Night flight===
[[Image:Hot air balloon glow.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Hot air balloons at night]]
The FAA requires balloons to fly under [[visual flight rules]].  If equipped with lights that make it visible to other aircraft, balloons can fly in the dark.  However, such flights are usually limited to either "dawn patrol" flights that begin before sunrise with landings made after there is sufficient light to see any obstacles or to race/record flights that typically go throughout the night and the landing again made during daylight hours. 

===Tethering===
Sometimes, especially at balloon festivals or other special events, balloons will be flown while still tied to the ground by ropes, referred to as '''tethers'''. This enables the pilot to provide shorts rides to many passengers instead of drifting with the wind away from the event with just one load of passengers. There are a variety of tethering techniques, depending on the balloon manufacturers instructions and current wind conditions. Tethers can be attached to the basket, burner support, the top of the envelope, or any combination thereof. Even though tethered, a registered aircraft is considered to be flying as soon as it leaves the ground, and is subject to all the appropriate rules and regulations.

Tethered balloons are sometimes inflated at night, an event called a "night glow" for the impressive visual effects.  At such events, pilots will usually operate the liquid valve known as the whisper burner (or sometimes called the ''cow burner'' as it is designed to make a different sound when operating so as not to startle livestock) on the burner creating a spectacular bright orange flame instead of the main valve which creates the more typical (and efficient) blue flame.

==Safety equipment==

To help ensure the safety of pilot and passengers, a hot air balloon may carry several pieces of safety equipment.

===In the basket===

In order to relight the burner, in case the [[pilot light]] goes out and the optional [[piezo ignition]] fails, the pilot should have ready access to a [[flint spark lighter]].

Many systems, especially those that carry passengers have completely redundant fuel and burner systems: two fuel tanks, connected to two separate hoses, which feed two distinct burners. This enables a safe landing in the case of a clog somewhere in one system or if a system must be disabled because of a fuel leak.

===On the occupants===

At least the pilot should wear flame resistant gloves. These can be made of leather or some more sophisticated material, such as [[nomex]]. These will enable the pilot to shut off a gas valve in the case of a leak even if there is a flame present. Quick action on the pilot's part to stop the flow of gas can turn a potential disaster into an inconvenience.

At least the pilot should wear clothes made of natural fibers. These will singe and not burn readily if brought into contact with an open flame. Many synthetic fibers unless especially formulated for use near flame or high temperatures, such as [[nomex]], will melt onto the wearer and can cause severe burning.

Some balloon systems, especially those that hang the burner from the envelope instead of supporting it rigidly from the basket, require the use helmets by the pilot and passengers.

===On the ground crew===

The ground crew should wear gloves on their hands whenever the possibility of handling ropes or lines exists. The mass and exposed surface to air movement of a medium sized balloon is sufficient to cause rope burns to the hands of anyone trying to stop or prevent movement.

The ground crew should also wear sturdy shoes and at least long pants in case of the need to access a landing or landed balloon in rough or overgrown terrain.

==Maintenance and repair==
As aircraft, hot air balloons require regular maintenance in order to remain airworthy. As aircraft made of fabric and that lack direct horizontal control, hot air balloons may occasionally require repairs to rips or snags.

While some operations, such as cleaning and drying, may be performed by the owner or pilot, other operations, such as sewing, must be performed by a qualified repair technician and recorded in the balloon's maintenance log book.

===Maintenance===
To ensure long life and safe operation, the envelope should be kept clean and dry. This prevents mold and mildew from forming on the fabric and abrasion from occurring during packing, transport, and unpacking due to contact with foreign particles. In the event of a landing in a wet (because of precipitation or early morning or late evening dew) or muddy location (farmer's field), the envelope should be cleaned and laid out or hung to dry.

The burner and fuel system must also be kept clean to ensure safe operation on demand. Damaged fuel hoses need to be replaced. Stuck or leaky valves must be repaired or replaced.

The wicker basket may require occasional refinishing or repair. The skids on its bottom may require occasional replacement.

===Repair===
In the case of a snag, burn, or rip in the envelope fabric, a patch may be applied or the effected panel completely replaced. Patches may be held in place with glue, tape, stitching, or a combination of these techniques. Replacing an entire panel requires the stitching around the old panel to be removed, and a new panel to be sewn in with the appropriate technique, thread, and stitch pattern.

==Licensing==
Depending on the size of the balloon, location, and intended use, hot air balloons and their pilots need to comply with a variety of regulations.
===Balloons===
In the USA, balloons below a certain size (empty weight of less than 254&nbsp;pounds or 115&nbsp;kg) can be used as [[Ultralight aviation|ultralights]] and cannot carry passengers, except for [[Flight training|pilot training]]. Anything larger than that must be registered (have an [[Aircraft registration|N-number]]), have an [[airworthiness]] certificate, and pass annual inspections.

===Pilots===
In the USA, a pilot does not need a license to fly an [[Ultralight aviation|ultralight]], but training is highly advised. For any balloon larger than an ultralight, or in order to carry passengers, a pilot must have a [[Pilot_certification_in_the_United_States|pilot certificate]] from the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]. In order to carry paying passengers (and attend many [[Hot air balloon festivals|balloon festivals]]), a pilot must have a [[Pilot_certification_in_the_United_States#Commercial|commercial pilot certificate]]. Commercial pilots may also act as [[flight instructor]]s.

==Events==
{{main|Hot air balloon festivals}}

There are many regular gatherings of balloons and balloonists around the world.  Most of these events are held on annual basis.  The festivities provide both a place for balloonists to interact as well as a venue for entertaining spectators.  Events range in size from a few balloons and no spectators to hundreds of balloons with hundreds of thousands of spectators.

==Manufacturers==
[[Image:balloon-specialshape.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Three "special shape" balloons with a conventionally shaped hot air balloon at the [[Canberra]] Balloon Festival, [[Australia]], 2004]]
The largest manufacturer of hot air balloons in the world is [[Cameron Balloons]] of [[Bristol]] and part owned subsidiary company, [[Lindstrand Balloons]] of [[Oswestry]], England. [http://www.aerostar.com/ Aerostar International, Inc.] of [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]] is North America's largest balloon manufacturer and is a close second in world manufacturing (note: Aerostar will no longer be building balloons beginning January 2007). [http://www.fireflyballoons.net/ Firefly Balloons], formerly known as The Balloon Works, is another popular manufacturer of hot-air balloons located in [[Statesville, North Carolina]]. Another long time producer of hot air balloons is [http://www.headballoons.com Head Balloons, Inc.], located in [[Helen, Georgia]].

Cameron Balloons, and another English balloon manufacturing company, Thunder and Colt (since acquired by Cameron), have been the main innovators and developers of special shaped balloons. These hot air balloons use the same principle of lift as conventional inverted teardrop shaped balloons but often sections of the special balloon envelope shape make no contribution to the balloon's ability to stay afloat. They have been produced in great variety and with eye-popping invention and wit.
