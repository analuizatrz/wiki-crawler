'''Nine Inch Nails''' (abbreviated as '''NIN''') <!--Avoid the Cyrillic letter, please--> is an [[United States|American]] [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] circa 1988 by [[Trent Reznor]]. As its main [[Producer (music)|producer]], singer, songwriter, and [[instrumentalist]], Reznor is the only official member of Nine Inch Nails and remains solely responsible for the musical direction of the band. His lyrics are largely concerned with dark explorations of the self, and the time between major studio albums (bridged by releases of [[remix]]es and [[live album]]s) has been extended by Reznor's battles with personal issues. After recording a new album, Reznor usually assembles a [[Nine Inch Nails: Live|live band]] to tour with him extensively; this live component is generally considered a separate entity from Nine Inch Nails in the [[recording studio]]. On stage, NIN performs amongst visually spectacular elements and live performances often culminate with the destruction of musical instruments.<ref name="Reimink">{{cite web

NIN's music straddles a wide range of genres and techniques while retaining a characteristically intense sound. [[Underground music]] audiences warmly received the band's early activity, and Nine Inch Nails went on to produce several highly influential releases in the 1990s to international acclaim. The band's work has been nominated for nine [[Grammy awards]], winning the [[Best Metal Performance]] category in 1993 and 1996. Media coverage of NIN reached a peak in 1997, when ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Trent Reznor one of the 25 most influential people in America.<ref name="Time">{{cite web

[[Image:Nin-pretty_hate_machine.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]''<br>(1989)]]
Primarily consisting of the ''Purest Feeling'' demos written, arranged, and performed by Trent Reznor with the addition of studio production and several new songs (including singles "[[Head Like A Hole]]" and "[[Sin (Nine Inch Nails song)|Sin]]"), NIN released ''Pretty Hate Machine'' in 1989. The album's production marked Reznor's first collaboration with [[Adrian Sherwood]] (who produced "Down in It" in [[London, England]] without having met Reznor face-to-face)<ref name = "AP90" /> and [[Mark Ellis (record producer)|Mark "Flood" Ellis]]. Flood's production would appear on each major NIN release until 1994, and Sherwood has done remixes for the band as recently as 2000. The songs on ''Pretty Hate Machine'' feature catchy melodies set against dark, introspective lyrics; Reznor proclaimed this combination "a sincere statement" of "what was in [his] head at the time."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/thrash.shtml

While recording the earliest NIN tracks, Reznor was unable to find a band that could articulate his songs as he wanted and instead decided to play all the instruments himself. For the band's studio recordings, this role largely remains Reznor's, though he has since involved other musicians and assistants. Nine Inch Nails first toured North America opening for industrial band Skinny Puppy as well as [[alternative rock]] acts such as [[Peter Murphy (musician)|Peter Murphy]] and [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]],<ref name="AMG" /> when Reznor received a reputation for smashing instruments on stage out of frustration.

The fruit of Reznor's disillusionment with his record label and culmination of the band's harsh, aggressive live sound, '''''Broken''''' was released in 1992 and took the form of an [[Extended Play|EP]] of six songs plus two bonus tracks; it went platinum in the US by the year's end.<ref name="RIAA.com" /> In the liner notes, Reznor credits his band from the 1991 tour as an influence on the guitar-based sound of ''Broken'', a sound that he described as "a blast of destruction".<ref name = "Shock" /> The song "[[Wish (song)|Wish]]", which was featured in a video directed by [[Peter Christopherson|Peter 'Sleazy' Christopherson]] of [[Coil (band)|Coil]], won a Grammy award in the 1992 Best Metal Performance category.<ref>{{cite web

Christopherson and Reznor collaborated on a longform music video (informally called ''[[Broken (film)|The Broken Movie]]''), incorporating more gruesome footage linking these three clips, but it has never been officially released. Videos for "Help Me I Am In Hell", "Gave Up" (filmed in [[Beverly Hills, California]] at Le Pig studios, site of the [[Charles Manson]] murders, where Reznor recorded ''The Downward Spiral'') and a 1995 live performance of "Wish" were made separately. ''Broken'' was followed by the remix EP ''[[Fixed (album)|Fixed]]'' in late 1992. Rather than tour for either EP, Reznor retreated to the studio and began work on a full-length follow-up.

The album spawned two commercial singles ("[[March of the Pigs]]" and "[[Closer to God|Closer]]") and two additional tracks ("[[Hurt (song)|Hurt]]" and "Piggy") were issued to radio without a commercial single release. In many ways, the "Closer" promo directed by [[Mark Romanek]] set a standard for Nine Inch Nails videos with its eerie images of pigs' heads and [[BDSM]] paraphernalia. MTV made significant edits to the video for objectionable content, but broadcast the edited version frequently, and a similarly censored radio edit that partially mutes the song's explicit lyrics received extensive radio airtime. "Hurt", which closes ''The Downward Spiral'' and was nominated for a [[Best Rock Song]] Grammy award in 1995,<ref name = "Grammy95" /> enjoyed renewed success when it was [[Cover version|covered]] by [[Johnny Cash]] in 2003 (appearing in another Romanek video).

This and other performances from NIN's marathon ''Self Destruct'' tour were documented on ''Closure''. The Nine Inch Nails live band also made appearances in performance videos for "Hurt", "Wish" and "Eraser", which were not issued to MTV, as well as "March of the Pigs" (re-recorded in-studio with one camera in a single take).

After ''The Downward Spiral'', Reznor produced a remix album entitled ''[[Further Down the Spiral]]'', the only non-major NIN release to be certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] in the US.<ref name="RIAA.com" /> It featured contributions from electronic music pioneer [[Aphex Twin]] and Jane's Addiction guitarist [[Dave Navarro]]. There are two versions of ''Further Down the Spiral'', both featuring exclusive content. A tenth anniversary reissue of ''The Downward Spiral'' was released on [[November 23]], [[2004]] as a two disc "Deluxe Edition" package. The release was remastered in [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] high definition [[Multichannel audio|5.1 surround sound]]. The first disc was a hybrid SACD/CD, one layer readable by SACD players, the other layer with the original stereo recording for CD players. A second dual-layer SACD featured b-sides, demos, and other non-album tracks in 2 channel stereo. The remastered 5.1 recording was also released concurrently as a two-sided [[DualDisc]]. One side included the album in [[Dolby Digital]] for standard DVD players as well as high definition [[DVD-A]] playable on DVD-A players, the other side was the original album in stereo readable by most traditional CD players.<ref>{{cite web

In the months following the release of ''With Teeth'', two new songs surfaced: "Non-Entity" (first performed by Reznor solo at the ''ReactNow!'' [[Hurricane Katrina]] [[benefit concert]]) and "Not So Pretty Now", both of which have appeared on set lists of the ''With Teeth'' tour. During a chat with fans on the official NIN fan club, The Spiral, Reznor stated that these songs were outtakes from the ''With Teeth'' sessions, and studio recordings of them may surface.<ref name="Spiral">{{cite web

===Corporate entanglements===
Nine Inch Nails was involved in a much-publicized feud with TVT Records, the first record label to sign the band.<ref name = "Shock" /> Reznor successfully sued to leave the label, but not without begrudgingly allowing them a percentage of all his future songwriting royalties. In reaction to TVT's artistic meddling, Reznor began releasing NIN albums on his own [[Nothing Records]] imprint.<ref name = "Huxley" /> Years later, Reznor sued his former friend and manager [[John Malm, Jr.]], co-founder of Nothing, for [[breach of contract]] and breach of [[Fiduciary|fiduciary duty]].<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=102

Nine Inch Nails dropped out of the 2005 [[MTV Movie Awards]] show because of a disagreement with the network over the use of an unaltered image of [[George W. Bush]] as a backdrop to the band's performance of "The Hand that Feeds", which includes such lyrics as:

:''What if this whole crusade's a charade''
:''And behind it all there's a price to be paid''
:''For the blood on which we dine''
:''Justified in the name of the holy and the divine''

On [[May 26]], [[2005]], Reznor wrote "apparently, the image of our president is as offensive to MTV as it is to me" on the [http://www.nin.com/current/archive3.html NIN website].<ref name = "E! Online" /> MTV replied that they respected Reznor's point of view, but were "uncomfortable" with the performance being "built around partisan political statements." A performance by the [[Foo Fighters]] replaced NIN's time slot on the show.<ref name = "E! Online" />

The ownership rights to ''Pretty Hate Machine'' were put on auction by TVT in 2005 at the behest of [[Prudential Financial|Prudential Securities]] bankruptcy proceedings. They offered the album as part of an overall package that included the rights to the ''Television's Greatest Hits'' compilations and the ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' movie soundtracks. In addition, the highest bidder was offered a percentage of future sales in all of Nine Inch Nails' TVT-related releases. [[Rykodisc]], who did not win the auction but were able to license the rights from Prudential, re-issued ''Pretty Hate Machine'' on [[November 22]], [[2005]].<ref>{{cite web

On [[October 24]], [[2006]], after being alerted by a fan website, Reznor issued a [[cease and desist]] to [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] for using three songs from ''The Fragile'' on air without permission.

==Discography==
{{main|Nine Inch Nails discography}}

While Nine Inch Nails has only issued five major studio albums, each is accompanied by numerous satellite releases, including [[remix album]]s, [[single (music)|singles]] with extensive [[b-side]]s, and tour documentaries. Indeed, each primary release is seen as the center of an associated era, in which the secondary releases are vital to understanding the artistic whole. This is underscored by the use of [[Nine Inch Nails discography#Halo numbers|''Halo'' numbers]], a sequential numbering system that applies to every NIN release and carries the implicit message that each is an equally-weighted component of the catalog, regardless of length or format. ''Halo'' numbers could also be considered as marketing enticement for fans to complete their collections.

Nine Inch Nails has recorded five songs specifically for film soundtracks: a cover of [[Joy Division]]'s "Dead Souls" for ''[[The Crow (album)|The Crow]]'', "[[Burn (Nine Inch Nails song)|Burn]]" and a reworked version of "Something I Can Never Have" for ''[[Natural Born Killers (soundtrack)|Natural Born Killers]]'', "[["The Perfect Drug" Versions|The Perfect Drug]]" for ''[[Lost Highway (soundtrack)|Lost Highway]]'' (which was nominated for a Best Hard Rock Performance Grammy in 1997),<ref>{{cite web

===Future releases===
In his blog on The Spiral fan club website, Trent Reznor announced the title of the next album as ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]''.<ref name="Spiral" /> The first single of the album, according to a recent article at Blabbermouth.net, will be titled "Survivalism."

== Musical characteristics ==
Nine Inch Nails' music has been categorized as [[Rock and roll|rock]], [[electronica]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[Alternative rock|alternative]], or, most commonly, [[industrial rock]].<ref name="AMG" /> This latter categorization upset [[industrial music]] "purists", most of whom disdained the application of the term to what could be regarded as [[pop song]]s. Reznor has never referred to his music as industrial but admits to borrowing techniques from such bands as [[Throbbing Gristle]] and [[Test Dept.]]<ref name="Axcess">{{cite web

| title = Talking About Nothing with Trent Reznor
| publisher = ''Axcess'' (1994), archived at [http://www.theninhotline.net The NIN Hotline]
| accessdate = 2006-10-22
}}</ref> Despite the disparity between those artists initially operating under the term "industrial" and NIN itself, it has become common in journalistic descriptions of Reznor's body of work to describe it as such. In actuality, the band's output has covered a wide range of genres: "The Perfect Drug" has the flavor of [[drum and bass]], "Down in It" was influenced by early [[Skinny Puppy]] (particularly their song "[[Mind: The Perpetual Intercourse|Dig It]]"),<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://9inchnails.com/articles/articles.php?id=17
| title = An Interview with Trent Reznor
| publisher = ''Spin'' (March 1996), archived at [http://www.9inchnails.com Painful Convictions]
| accessdate = 2006-10-22}}</ref> "Happiness in Slavery" is tinged with [[industrial metal]] in the vein of [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], "The Frail" is a melancholy piano piece, and most of ''Pretty Hate Machine'' could be described as dark electronic pop.

While it displays uncommonly versatile sonic design and composition for a [[rock band]], certain techniques and styles are found throughout NIN's catalog. Extreme [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] are staples of songs like "With Teeth", "Wish" ({{audio-nohelp|Wish.ogg|sample}}) and "[[The Day the World Went Away]]" ({{audio-nohelp|TDtWWA.ogg|sample}}), which quickly change from quiet to loud and back again; the latter two end with a loud climax followed by an abrupt stop, rather than by fading out or letting the final note resonate. Reznor's singing follows a similar pattern, moving from whispers to screams with facility. The band's music also has distinct rhythmic features, occasionally favoring odd [[time signatures]], abrupt time signature changes and jarring [[polyrhythm|cross-rhythms]] (examples of which can be found in songs like "La Mer", "March of the Pigs" and "The Collector").<ref name = "PopMatters" /><ref>{{cite web | url =

| author = Nash, Rob
| accessdate = 2006-12-20
}}</ref>

On each album since ''Broken'', Reznor has included at least one piece built around an instrumental [[ostinato]]. These tracks tend to begin moderately quiet and slowly crescendo into a climax of noise and distortion; "Help Me I Am In Hell," "Eraser," "The Way Out Is Through," "La Mer" and "Beside You in Time", all of which are typically accompanied by a video segment when performed live, fit into this category. Similarly, some NIN albums contain a repeating [[Motif (music)|motif]] that reappears multiple times in different songs and contexts (either on a different musical instrument, with a transposed harmony or in an altered tempo).<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xrevw136.shtml

| publisher = Lollipop Online (May 2000), archived at [http://www.theninhotline.net The NIN Hotline]
| author = Marburger, Lex
| accessdate = 2006-12-20}}</ref>

Reznor also has an affinity for [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] in his compositions, often created with chromatic melody and/or harmony. Perhaps the most famous use of this technique is in the song "Closer" ({{audio-nohelp|Closer.ogg|sample}}), where Reznor adds a four-note synthesizer riff featuring an [[augmented (music)|augmented interval]] after the first chorus. He concludes the song with a heavily chromatic piano motif, the same that recurs on the title track of ''The Downward Spiral''.<ref name = "PopMatters" /> "[[Hurt (song)|Hurt]]" ({{audio-nohelp|Hurt.ogg|sample}}), from the same album, features a highly dissonant [[tritone]] in the verses, a B5(#11), which is emphasized when Reznor sings the [[eleventh]] on the word "I" every time the B/F [[Dyad (music)|dyad]] is played. In other cases, Reznor resorts to pure atonality, either by using oddly tuned instruments (as in tracks such as "Leaving Hope" and "[[The New Flesh]]") or literal noise in the song's arrangement ("Happiness In Slavery", "Mr. Self Destruct" and "The Wretched" being prime examples).

==Band members==
{{main|Nine Inch Nails: Live}}
It is generally understood that the Nine Inch Nails live band is a separate entity from the recording studio-based component of NIN.<ref name="Reimink" /> Occasionally, past band members are invited to participate in the process, but when not directly involved with recording new material, Nine Inch Nails' lineup tends to change drastically between major tours. Aside from Trent Reznor remaining on lead vocals, nothing about the live band has remained constant since its inception. Reznor cited the long gestation period between studio albums as part of the reason for these personnel changes.<ref>{{cite web
