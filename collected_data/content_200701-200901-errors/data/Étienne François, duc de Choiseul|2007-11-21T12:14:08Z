'''Étienne-François, duc de Choiseul''' ([[June 28]], [[1719]] &mdash; [[May 8]], [[1785]]) was a [[France|French]] military officer, diplomat and statesman.

He was the eldest son of François Joseph de Choiseul, marquis de Stainville (1700&mdash;1770), and bore in early life the title of comte de Stainville. He entered the army, and during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] served in [[Bohemia]] in [[1741]] and in [[Italy]], where he distinguished himself at the battle of Coni, in [[1744]]. From 1745 until 1748 he was with the army in the [[Low Countries]], being present at the sieges of [[Mons]], [[Charleroi]] and [[Maastricht]]. He attained the rank of [[lieutenant-general]], and in [[1750]] married Louise Honorine, daughter of Louis François Crozat, marquis du Châtel (d. 1750), who brought her husband her share of the large fortune of her grandfather [[Antoine Crozat]] and proved a most devoted wife.

Choiseul gained the favour of [[Madame de Pompadour]] by procuring for her some letters which [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV]] had written to his cousin Madame de Choiseul, with whom the king had formerly had an intrigue; and after a short time as [[bailli]] of the [[Vosges]] he was given the appointment of ambassador to [[Rome]] in [[1753]], where he was entrusted with the negotiations concerning the disturbances called forth by the [[papal bull|bull]] ''[[Unigenitus]]''. He acquitted himself skilfully in this task, and in [[1757]] his patroness obtained his transfer to [[Vienna]], where he was instructed to cement the new alliance between France and [[Austria]]. His success at Vienna opened the way to a larger career, when in [[1758]] he supplanted [[Cardinal de Bernis]] (1715-1794) as [[Foreign Minister of France|minister for foreign affairs]] and so had the direction of French foreign policy during the [[Seven Years' War]]. At this time he was made a [[peer of France]] and created ''duc de Choiseul'' ([[Duke]]). Although from 1761 until 1766 his cousin [[César Gabriel de Choiseul]] (1712-1785), duc de Praslin, was minister for foreign affairs, yet Choiseul continued to control the policy of France until 1770, and during this period held most of the other important offices of state. As the author of the ''[[Pacte de Famille]]'' he sought to retrieve by an alliance with the [[Bourbon house]] of Spain the disastrous results of the alliance with Austria; but his action came too late. His vigorous policy in other departments of state was not, however, fruitless.

Coming to power in the midst of the demoralization consequent upon the defeats of [[Rossbach]] and [[Crefeld]], by boldness and energy he reformed and strengthened both army and navy, and although too late to prevent the loss of [[Canada]] and [[India]], he developed [[French colonies]] in the [[Antilles]] and [[San Domingo]], and added [[Corsica]] and [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] to the crown of France. His management of home affairs in general satisfied the ''[[philosophes]]''. He allowed the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' to be published, and brought about the [[Suppression of the Jesuits|banishment of the Jesuits]] and the temporary abolition of the order by [[Pope Clement XIV]].

Choiseul's fall was caused by his action towards the [[Jesuits]], and by his support of their opponent [[La Chalotais]], and of the provincial parlements. After the death of Madame de Pompadour in 1764, his enemies, led by [[Madame du Barry]] and the chancellor [[René Nicolas Charles Augustin de Maupeou|Maupeou]], were too strong for him, and at the height of the [[Falkland Crisis (1770)|Falkland Crisis]] in [[1770]] he was ordered to retire to his estate at [[Chanteloup]]. The intrigues against him had, however, increased his popularity, which was already great, and during his retirement, which lasted until [[1774]], he lived in the greatest affluence and was visited by many eminent personages. Greatly to his disappointment [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] did not restore him to his former position, although the king allowed him to come back to Paris in 1774, where he died on May 8, 1785, leaving behind him a huge accumulation of debt which was scrupulously discharged by his widow.

Choiseul possessed both ability and diligence, and though lacking in tenacity he showed foresight and liberality in his direction of affairs. In appearance he was a short, ill-featured man, with a ruddy countenance and a sturdy frame. His ''Mémoires'' were written during his exile from Paris, and are merely detached notes upon different questions. [[Horace Walpole]], in his ''Memoirs'', gives a very vivid description of the duke's character, accuses him of [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)|exciting the war]] between [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]] in [[1768]] in order to be revenged upon the tsarina [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]], and says of his foreign policy, "he would project and determine the ruin of a country, but could not meditate a little mischief or a narrow benefit." " He dissipated the nation's wealth and his own; but did not repair the latter by plunder of the former," says the same writer, who in reference to Choiseul's private life asserts that "gallantry without delicacy was his constant pursuit." Choiseul's widow, a woman " in whom industrious malice could not find an imperfection," lived in retirement until her death on December 3, 1808.

[[Choiseul Island]], the largest island of the [[Solomon Islands]] is named after him.
