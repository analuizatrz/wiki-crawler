'''Gela''' is a city in the [[province of Caltanissetta]] in the south of [[Sicily]], [[Italy]]. The city is at about 84 kilometers distance from the city of [[Caltanissetta]], on the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The city has a larger population than the provincial capital, and ranks second in land area.

Gela is an important industrial city and port town. One important industry that is located here is that of petroleum refinery. The city can be reached from other cities, like Syracuse and Caltanissetta, by train.

==History==
===Ancient Gela===
The city was founded around [[688 BC]] by colonists from [[Rhodos]] (Rhodes) and [[Crete]], 45 years after [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]. The city was named after the [[Gela (river)|river Gela]]. The Greeks had many colonies in the south of what is now Italy, and for many centuries the Greeks had a major influence on the area. Gela flourished and, after only a century, a group of ''Geloi'' founded the colony of [[Agrigento]]. The expansion, however, led to economic and social strains, which led the plebs to leave the city and settle in nearby [[Maktorion]]. However, the revolt was opposed by the great priest of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and the exiled plebs returned to Gela.

For over a century no further mention is made about the internal politics of the city, until the ancient historians note that a tyrant, [[Cleander of Gela|Cleander]], ruled Gela between [[505 BC]] and [[498 BC]]. After his death, power transferred to his brother [[Hippocrates of Gela|Hippocrates]], who conquered Callipoli, [[Leontini]], [[Naxos (Sicily)|Naxos]], Hergetios and Zancles, the current [[Messina]]. Only [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], with the help of her former colonizing city, [[Corinth]] and [[Corcyra]], managed to escape the Gelese expansion. When [[Camarina]], a Syracusan colony, rebelled in [[492 BC]], Hippocrates intervened to wage war against Syracuse. After having defeated the Syracusan army at the Heloros river, he besieged the city. However, in the end he was convinced to retreat in exchange for the possession of Camarina. The tyrant lost his life in [[491 BC|491]] in a battle against the [[Siculi]], the native Sicilian people.

Hippocrates was succeeded by [[Gelo]], who, in [[484 BC|484]], conquered Syracuse and moved his seat of government there.  His brother [[Hiero I of Syracuse|Hiero]] was given control over Gela. When [[Theron]] of Agrigento conquered [[Himera]] and a [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] army disembarked in Sicily to counter him, he asked for help from Gela and Syracuse. Gelo and Hiero were victorious in the subsequent [[battle of Himera]], in which the Carthaginian leader Hamilcar lost his life.

After the death of Gelo (478 BC), Hiero moved to Syracuse, leaving Gela to Polyzelos. Thenceforth the history of the city becomes uncertain: it has been suggested that the citizens freed themselves from the rule of tyrants and established a democratic government. 

Many of the ''Geloi'' returned from Syracuse in this period, and the city regained part of its power: [[Aischylos]] died in this city in [[456 BC]]. Gela was at the head of Sicilian league the pushed back the [[Athens|Atheniese]] attempt to conquer the island in [[424 BC|424]] (see [[Sicilian Expedition]]).

In [[406 BC|406]] the Carthaginians conquered Agrigento and destroyed it. Gela asked for the help of [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]]. However, for unknown reasons, the latter did not arrive in time and, after heroic deeds, Gela was turned into ruins and its treasures sacked ([[405 BC|405]]). The survivors took refuge in Syracuse. In [[397 BC|397]] they returned home and joined [[Dionysius II of Syracuse|Dionysius II]] in his struggle for the freedom from the invaders, and in [[383 BC]] they saw their independence acknowledged.

Under [[Agathocles]] ([[317 BC|317]]-[[289 BC]]) the city suffered again for internal strife between the general population and the aristocrats. When the Carthaginians arrived in [[311 BC]], they met little resistance and captured the city with the help of the ''aristoi''. In [[282 BC]] [[Phintias]] of Agrigento, who had founded a city next to the modern [[Licata]], destroyed ruthlessly Gela to crush forever its power.

===Roman, Byzantine and Mediaeval Gela===
The city subsequently disappeared from the chronicles. Under the Roman domination a small settlement still existed, which is mentioned by [[Virgil]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Cicero]] and [[Strabo]]. Later it was a Byzantine minor center. Under the Arab it was known as "City of Columns".

The later city was founded in AD [[1233]] by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] by the name '''Terranova''', by which it remained known until [[1928]]. The new settlement was west of the ancient Gela, andwas provided with a castle and a line of walls. Terranova, also known as ''Heracles'', was a royal possession until [[1369]], when King [[Frederick III of Sicily|Frederick III of Aragon]] gave it to Manfredi III Chiaramonte. In [[1401]], however, it was confiscated after the treason of Andrea Chiaramonte, and assigned to several Aragonese feudataries. In [[1530]] the title of Marquis of Terranova was created for Giovanni Tagliavia Aragona, and in 1561 his son Carlo obtained the title of Duke. The Terranova Aragona held the city until [[1640]], when the marriage of Giovanna Tagliavia Aragona and Ettore Pignatelli give the possession to the latter's family. The Pignatelli held the fief until 1812.

===Modern Gela===

Renamed '''Terranova di Sicilia''', in 1927 the city was given back the name of Gela.

During the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] in [[World War II]], Allied forces repelled an Italian and German armored counterattack at Gela in July 1943. The [[US First Infantry Division]] landed on the beaches during the initail assault, also.

After the war, a large [[oil refinery]] was built in the Gela's territory, as a part of [[Enrico Mattei]]'s industrial expansion plan. This move tried to help the economy of the region, but instead it created significant damage to the area's visual appearance and touristic appeal. The chaotic building program, which was carried out in the absence of a planning process, created almost intractable social problems. 

In the 1980s, the area saw the increasing power of a [[mafioso]] association, [[Stidda]], which was protagonist of a long series of violences and homicides. In December 2001, as part of a large anti-mafia operation led by the provincial [[carabinieri]], 88 arrest warrants were carried out and a number of companies associated with Gela's Rinzivillo mafia clan were seized under suspicion of money laundering and drug trafficking. The strong mafia influence in the city is partly responsible for the Gela's lack of tourism, with attempts to invest in the local tourism industry (through the creation of hotels etc.) being repeatedly, and mysteriously, blocked.

Recently a development and recovering program has slightly improved the situation of the city. The universities of [[University of Catania|Catania]] and [[University of Palermo|Palermo]] have opened faculties in Gela, and the historical center, as well as the archaeological area, the seaside and the Castelluccio, have been renovated.
