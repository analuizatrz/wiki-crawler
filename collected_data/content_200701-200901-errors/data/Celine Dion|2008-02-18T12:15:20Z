Her popularity spread to other parts of the world when she competed in the 1982 [[Yamaha (manufacturer)|Yamaha]] [[World Popular Song Festival]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], and won the musician's award for "Top Performer" as well as the gold medal for "Best Song," with "[[Tellement j'ai d'amour pour toi]]" ("I Have So Much Love for You").<ref name=Jam>[http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/D/Dion_Celine.html Celine Dion Biography].

A year after she had learned English, Dion made her debut into the Anglophone market with ''[[Unison (album)|Unison]]'' (1990).<ref name=Jam>[http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/D/Dion_Celine.html Celine Dion Biography].

[[March 07]], [[1994]]</ref> The album was largely influenced by 1980s [[soft rock]] music that quickly found a niche within the [[adult contemporary]] radio format. ''Unison'' hit the right notes with critics: Jim Faber of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote that Dion's vocals were "tastefully unadorned," and that she never attempted to "bring off styles that are beyond her."<ref>{{cite web | title=Entertainment Weekly | work=Review--Céline Dion Unison | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/review/music/0,6115,313100_4_0_,00.html| accessmonthday=November 18 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> Stephen Erlewine of ''[[All Music Guide]]'' declared it as, "a fine, sophisticated American debut."<ref>{{cite web | title=All Music Guide | work=Review--Céline Dion Unison | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:6227gjlrj6in | accessmonthday=November 18 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> Singles from the album included "[[(If There Was) Any Other Way]]," "[[The Last to Know]]," "[[Unison (song)#Céline Dion version)|Unison]]," and "[[Where Does My Heart Beat Now]]," a mid-tempo soft-rock ballad which made prominent use of the [[electric guitar]]. The latter became her first single to chart on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number four. The album established Dion as a rising singer in the United States, and across [[Continental Europe]] and Asia. In 1991, Dion was also a soloist in "[[Voices That Care]]," a tribute to American troops fighting in [[Operation Desert Storm]]. 

Dion's real international breakthrough came when she duetted with [[Peabo Bryson]] on the title track to [[Disney]]'s animated film ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991).<ref name=Bliss>Bliss, Karen. "25 Years of Canadian Artists." ''Canadian Musician''. March 01, 2004. pg. 34. ISSN: 07089635</ref> The song captured a musical style that Dion would utilize in the future: sweeping, classically influenced ballads with soft instrumentation. Both a critical and commercial hit, the song became her second U.S. top ten single, and won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Best Song]], and the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]].<ref name=Time1>Alexander, Charles P. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,980285,00.html The Power of Celine Dion]". ''[[Time (Magazine)|Time]]''. [[March 07]], [[1994]]</ref>
"[[Beauty and the Beast (Disney song)|Beauty and the Beast]]" was featured on Dion's 1992 [[Celine Dion (album)|self-titled]] album, which, like her debut, had a strong rock influence combined with elements of soul and classical music. Owing to the success of the lead-off single and her collaboration with Foster and [[Diane Warren]], the album was as well received as ''Unison''. Other singles that achieved moderate success included "[[If You Asked Me To#Céline Dion version|If You Asked Me To]]" (a [[Cover version|cover]] of [[Patti LaBelle]]'s song from the 1989 movie ''[[Licence to Kill]]'') which peaked at number four on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], the gospel-tinged "[[Love Can Move Mountains]]," and "[[Nothing Broken But My Heart]]." As with Dion's earlier releases, the album had an overtone of love. 

By 1992 ''Unison'', ''Céline Dion'', and media appearances had propelled Dion to superstardom in North America. She had achieved one of her main objectives: wedging her way into the Anglophone market and achieving fame.<ref name=atop>Alexander, Charles P.

However, the relationship was kept a secret as they both feared that the public would find their relations inappropriate.<ref name=cel>"Celine Dion." ''Contemporary Musicians, Volume 25''. Gale Group, 1999.</ref>

===1993–1995: Popularity established===

In 1993 Dion announced her feelings for her manager by declaring him "the colour of [her] love" in the dedication section of her third Anglophone album ''[[The Colour of My Love]]''. However, instead of criticizing their relationship as Dion had feared, fans embraced the couple.<ref name=Time1>Alexander, Charles P.

[[March 07]], [[1994]]</ref> Eventually, Angélil and Dion married in an extravagant wedding ceremony in December 1994, which was broadcast live on Canadian television. 

As it was dedicated to her manager, the album's motif focused on love and romance.<ref name=plugged>[http://www.pluggedinonline.com/music/music/a0001109.cfm Celine Dion, ''The Colour of My Love'']. ''Plugged in''. Retrieved [[September 13]], [[2007]]</ref> It became her most successful record up to that point, selling more than six million copies in the U.S., two million in Canada, and peaking at number-one in many countries. The album also spawned Dion's first U.S., Canadian, and Australian number-one single "[[The Power of Love (Jennifer Rush song)#Céline Dion version|The Power of Love]]" (a remake of [[Jennifer Rush]]'s 1985 hit), which would become her [[signature song|signature hit]] until she reached new career heights in the late 1990s.<ref name=atop>Alexander, Charles P. "The Arts & Media/Music: At Age Five She Belted Out French pop tunes standing atop tables." ''Time International''. February 28 1994. pg 44.</ref> Subsequent singles, such as "[[When I Fall in Love#Céline Dion and Clive Griffin version|When I Fall in Love]]," a [[duet]] with [[Clive Griffin]], and "[[Misled]]" failed to reach the upper tier of the pop charts in the U.S., but were moderately successful in Canada. ''The Colour of My Love'' also became Dion's first bona fide hit in Europe, and in particular the [[United Kingdom]]. Both the album and the single "[[Think Twice (song)|Think Twice]]" simultaneously occupied the top of the British charts for five consecutive weeks. "Think Twice," which remained at number one for seven weeks, eventually became the fourth single by a female artist to sell in excess of one million copies in the U.K.,<ref>{{cite web | title=Celinedion.com| work=The Journey so Far| url=http://www.celinedion.com/celinedion/english/journey3.html | accessmonthday=August 16 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> while the album was eventually certified five-times platinum for two-million copies sold.

Dion kept to her French roots and continued to release many Francophone recordings between each English record.<ref name=Brit>"Celine Dion." Compton's by Britannica. ''Encyclopedia Britannica''. 2005.</ref> These included ''[[Dion chante Plamondon]]'' (1991); ''[[À l'Olympia]]'' (1994), a live album that was recorded during one of Dion's concerts at the [[Paris Olympia|Olympia Theatre]] in [[Paris]]; and ''[[D'eux]]'' (1995 — also known as ''The French Album'' in the United States), which would go on to become the best-selling French album of all time.<ref name=Brit>"Celine Dion." Compton's by Britannica. ''Encyclopedia Britannica''. 2005.</ref> As these albums were in French, the worldwide commercial success was limited. However, Dion's Francophone fans embraced each release,<ref>Colombo, John Robert. ''Arts and Entertainment: Popular Music. The 1998 Canadian Global Almanac''. Macmillan Canada, 1998.</ref> and generally, they achieved more credibility than her Anglophone works.<ref name=crit>"Celine Dion." ''Newsmakers 1995'', Issue 4. Gale Research, 1995.</ref>

The mid-1990s was a transitional period for Dion's musical style, as she slowly diverged from strong rock influences and transitioned into a more pop and soul style (though the electric guitar remained a central part of her music). Her songs began with more delicate melodies that used softer instrumentations, and built up to strong climaxes, over which her vocals could be displayed.<ref name=Let>''[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:osr67u50o0jw All Music Guide]''.

Compared to her debut, both the quality and sound of Dion's music had also changed significantly. The soft-rock influences on her earlier releases were no longer prominent; they were replaced by more soul/adult contemporary styles. However, the theme of "love" remained in all her releases, and this led to many critics dismissing her work as banal.<ref name=find>{{cite web | title= findarticles.com|work =The unsinkable Céline Dion - French-Canadian singer - Interview|url= http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_3_29/ai_54133689|accessmonthday=December 5 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> In a scathing review of ''Let's Talk About Love'', Rob O'Connor wrote:

Dion was also criticized for some of her remakes and duets. "[[The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face#Céline Dion version|The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face]]" and "[[All the Way (song)|All the Way]]" were described as disastrous and "creepy" by both Allison Stewart of ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' and Erlwine of ''All Music Guide''.<ref>Stewart, Allison.

===2000–2002: Career break===

Chuck Taylor of ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' wrote, "the performance... brings to mind what has made her one of the celebrated vocalists of our time: the ability to render emotion that shakes the soul.

===2002–2003: Return to music===
Dion's aptly titled ''[[A New Day Has Come]]'', released in March 2002, ended her three-year break from the music industry. The album was Dion's most personal yet, and established a more mature side of Dion with the songs "[[A New Day Has Come (song)|A New Day Has Come]]," "[[I'm Alive]]," and "[[Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)]]," a change that resulted from her new-found maternal responsibilities, because, in her own words, "becoming a mother makes you a grown-up."<ref name=vh1>{{cite web| title=VH1 | work= Céline Dion: Let's Talk About Success: The Singer Explains Her Career High-Points| url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1453531/04222002/dion_celine.jhtml| accessmonthday = December 19 | accessyear= [[2005]]}}</ref> She stated, "''A New Day Has Come'', for Rene, for me, is the baby.

[[Image:ImageOHcap5.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The upbeat tempo of "[[One Heart (song)|One Heart]]" and the bright colours and "party" style of the music video were a new direction to Céline Dion's work.]]

Drawing inspiration from personal experiences, Dion released ''[[One Heart]]'' (2003), an album that represented her appreciation for life.<ref>Flick, Larry. ''One Heart''. [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' magazine. New York: [[March 29]] [[2003]]. Vol.115, Iss. 13; pg. 30, 1 pgs</ref> The album largely consisted of dance music &mdash; a deviation from the soaring, melodramatic ballads, for which she had once been given mixed reception. Although it achieved moderate success, ''One Heart'' hinted at Dions' inability to overcome the creative wall that she had hit, and words such as "predictable" and "banal" appeared even in the most lenient reviews.<ref>{{cite web | title=All Music Guide | work=Review--One Heart| url= http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:30dovwnqa9ek| accessmonthday=July 17 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref>Durchholz, Daniel.

Atlanta, Georgia: [[March 25]] [[2003]]. pg. C.1.</ref> 

By the mid 2000s Dion's music had changed to the point where her releases possessed maternal overtones. ''[[Miracle (Celine Dion album)|Miracle]]'' (2004), a multimedia project conceived by Dion and photographer [[Anne Geddes]], had a theme centering on babies and motherhood. The album was saturated with lullabies and other songs of maternal love and inspiration, the two most popular being covers of [[Louis Armstrong]]'s "[[What a Wonderful World]]" and [[John Lennon]]'s "[[Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)#Céline Dion version|Beautiful Boy]]." The reviews for ''Miracle'' were generally weak: while [[Charles Taylor]] of ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' magazine wrote that the single "Beautiful Boy" was "an unexpected gem" and called Dion "a timeless, enormously versatile artist,"<ref>Taylor, Chuck. ''Céline Dion: "Beautiful Boy"''. ''Billboard''. New York: October 16, 2004.Vol.116, Iss. 42; pg. 33, 1 pgs</ref> Chuck Arnold of ''People'' Magazine labeled the album as excessively sentimental,<ref>Arnold, Chuck. "Review: Celine Dion, Miracle." ''[[People Magazine]].'' [[November 22]] [[2004]]. pg, 48.</ref> while Nancy Miller of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' opined that "the whole earth-mama act is just opportunism."<ref>{{cite web | title=Entertainment Weekly | work=Review: Miracle| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/review/music/0,6115,724253_4_0_,00.html| accessmonthday= November 30 | accessyear= 2005}}</ref> 

The Francophone album ''[[1 fille & 4 types]]'' (''1 Girl & 4 Guys'', 2003), fared better than her first two comebacks, and showed Dion trying to distance herself from the "diva" image. She recruited [[Jean-Jacques Goldman]], Gildas Arzel, Eric Benzi, and Jacques Veneruso, with whom she had previously worked on two of her best selling French albums ''[[S'il suffisait d'aimer]]'' and ''[[D'eux]]''. Labeled "the album of pleasure" by Dion herself, the cover showed Dion in a simple and relaxed manner, contrary to the choreographed poses usually found on her album covers. The album achieved relative critical success: reviewer Stephen Erlwine of ''All Music Guide'' wrote that Dion was "getting back to pop basics and performing at a level unheard in a while."<ref>{{cite web | title= All Music Guide| work=Review--1 Fille & 4 Types|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:5uhqoatawijz|accessmonthday=November 20 |accessyear= 2005}}</ref> 

Though her albums were relatively successful, signs of a decline began to appear in the poorer critical reception of ''[[The Collector's Series, Volume One]]'' (2000), ''A New Day Has Come'' (2002), and ''One Heart'' (2003). The mass appeal of Dion's later works had declined due to the nature of the themes. Her songs received less airplay as radio became less embracing of balladeers like Dion, Carey and Houston, and was focused on more up-tempo, [[Urban contemporary|Urban]]/[[Hip hop music|Hip-hop]] songs.<ref>Gardner, Elysa.

In early 2002 Dion had announced a three-year, 600-show contract to appear five nights a week in an entertainment extravaganza, ''[[A New Day...]]'', at [[Caesars Palace]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].<ref name= Lavid>Helligar, Jeremy. "Celine Dion livin' la vida Vegas!." ''Us''.

''<nowiki>'A New Day'</nowiki>: Vegas gamble pays off for Céline Dion"''.

"Celine Dion livin' la vida Vegas!." ''Us''. [[March 31]], [[2003]].pg 56.</ref> The show, put together by Dragone, was a combination of dance, music, and visual effects. It included Dion performing her biggest hits against an array of dancers and special effects.

Reviewer Mike Weatherford felt that, at first, Dion was not as relaxed as she should be, and at times, it was hard to find the singer among the excessive stage ornamentations and dancers. However, he noted that the show had become more enjoyable, due to Dion's improved stage-presence and simpler costumes.<ref name=jour>{{cite journal | author= Weatherford, Mike| title= Show review: As Dion feels more comfortable, her show improves| journal= Reviewjournal.com | year= 2004| url= http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Oct-01-Fri-2004/weekly/24865136.html}}</ref> 
The show was also well-received by audiences, despite the complaints of expensive tickets; the show sold out almost every night since its 2003 opening. According to ''[[Pollstar]]'', Dion sold 322,000 tickets and grossed [[United States dollar|US$]]43.9 million in the first half of 2005, and by July 2005, she had sold out 315 out of 384 shows.<ref>{{cite news | title= Dion extends long Las Vegas stint| date=Sunday, [[19 September]] [[2004]] | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3670760.stm}}</ref>

===2005 –present: Back to studio===
In 2005, Dion released her first comprehensive greatest hits album in French, ''[[On ne change pas]]'', which features three new songs, including a duet with [[Il Divo]] called "[[I Believe in You (Je crois en toi)|I Believe in You]]" and two other new song. The Album debuted at number 1 in France and set a record for a compilation album selling 109,000 copies in the first week and went on to sell 1.5 million copies worldwide. A dvd Compilation was also released with the same title [[On ne change pas (DVD)|On ne change pas]] and was a big success in France.

Her latest French language album, ''[[D'elles]]'', released on [[May 21]] [[2007]], debuted at the top of the Canadian album charts, selling 72,200 copies in its first week.

==Artistry and image ==
Dion grew up listening to the music of [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Carole King]], [[Anne Murray]], [[Barbra Streisand]], and the [[Bee Gees]], all of whom she would eventually collaborate with. During her younger years, which she spent performing in her parents' piano bar along with her other siblings, she also performed many songs by [[Ginette Reno]] and other popular Quebecois artists. She has also expressed appreciation for [[Édith Piaf]], Sir [[Elton John]], and [[opera]] singer [[Luciano Pavarotti]], as well as many soul singers of the 1960s, 70's and 80's, including [[Roberta Flack]], [[Etta James]] and [[Patti Labelle]], whose songs she would later rerecord. Her English-language material has been influenced by numerous genres, including [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[R&B]] and [[soul music|soul]], and her lyrics focus on themes of poverty, world hunger, and spirituality, with an overemphasis on love and romance.<ref name=plugged>[http://www.pluggedinonline.com/music/music/a0001109.cfm Celine Dion, ''The Colour of My Love''].

Dion has faced considerable criticism from many critics, who state that her music often retreats behind pop and soul conventions, and marked by excessive sentimentality.<ref name= Enc>{{cite web | title=The Canadian Encyclopedia | work=Céline Dion Biography | url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0000970

Many critics have stated that Dion's involvement in the production aspect of her music is fundamentally lacking, which results in her work being overproduced<ref name=cbcc>"[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/celinedion.html The real Céline: Céline Dion’s new French album shows her personal side]." ''CBC''. [[May 29]], 2007. Retrieved [[September 25]], 2007.</ref> and impersonal.<ref name=crit>"Celine Dion." ''Newsmakers 1995'', Issue 4. Gale Research, 1995.</ref> Additionally, while she came from a family in which all of her siblings were musicians, she never learned to master any musical instruments, although it does appear she can play the piano to an extent (based upon a video released of the recording sessions for her "Let's talk about love" album. However, she did help to compose many of her earlier French songs, and had always tried to involve herself with the production and recording of her albums. On her first English album, which she recorded before she had a firm command of the English language, she expressed disapproval of the record, which, according to her, could have been avoided if she had assumed more creative input.<ref name=crit>"Celine Dion." ''Newsmakers 1995'', Issue 4. Gale Research, 1995.</ref> By the time she released her second English album ''[[Celine Dion (album)|Celine Dion]]'', she had assumed more control of the production and recording process, hoping to dispel earlier criticisms. She stated, "On the second album I said, 'Well, I have the choice to be afraid one more time and not be 100 percent happy, or not be afraid and be part of this album.' This is my album."<ref name=crit>"Celine Dion." ''Newsmakers 1995'', Issue 4. Gale Research, 1995.</ref> She would continue to involve herself in the production of subsequent releases, helping to write a few of her songs on ''[[Let's Talk About Love]]'' (1997) and ''[[These Are Special Times]]'' (1998).<ref>Among others, Dion helped to compose "[[Treat Her Like a Lady]]" from ''Let's Talk About love'', and "[[Don't Save It All for Christmas Day]]" from ''These Are Special Times''</ref>

Despite her success, Dion is often the subject of media ridicule and parody. She is frequently impersonated on shows like ''[[MADtv]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[South Park]]'' for her strong accent, as well as her conservative nature and on-stage movements. She is also heavily mocked in her home country of Canada on popular shows ''[[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'' and ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]''. However, Dion has stated that she is unaffected by the comments, and has even stated that she is flattered that people take the time to impersonate her.<ref name=vh1>{{cite web| title=VH1 | work= Céline Dion: Let's Talk About Success: The Singer Explains Her Career High-Points| url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1453531/04222002/dion_celine.jhtml| accessmonthday = December 19 | accessyear= [[2005]]}}</ref> She even invited [[Ana Gasteyer]], who parodied her on SNL, to appear on stage during one of her performances.

Dion is rarely the center of media controversies. However, in 2005, following the [[Hurricane Katrina]] disaster, she appeared on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' and tearfully criticized [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] regarding the [[Iraq War]] and his slow response in aiding the victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]]: "How come it's so easy to send planes in another country, to kill everyone in a second, to destroy lives? We need to be there right now to rescue the rest of the people."<ref>{{cite web | title=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation| work= Céline Dion takes swipe at Iraq war; donates $1m to Katrina victims| url=http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2005/09/04/Arts/celine_dion_iraq20050904.html| accessmonthday=July 14 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> She later claimed, "When I do interviews with [[Larry King]] or the big TV shows like that, they put you on the spot, which is very difficult.
