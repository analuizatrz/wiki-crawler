'''''The Lion King''''' is a [[1994 in film|1994]] [[animated feature]] film produced by [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. It is the 32nd film in the [[List of Disney animated features|Disney animated feature]] canon, and the highest-grossing traditionally animated feature film in the [[United States]]. The film focuses on a young [[lion]] in [[Africa]] named [[Simba]], who learns of his place in the "Circle of Life" while struggling through various obstacles to become the rightful king.

''The Lion King'' is a musical film, with songs written by composer [[Elton John]] and lyricist [[Tim Rice]], and a film score by [[Hans Zimmer]]. The score and one of its songs won [[Academy Award]]s.<ref name="boxofficemojo">{{cite web | work=boxofficemojo.com- 1994 Academy Awards | title=''The Lion King'' - 1994 Academy Awards |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/oscar/movies/?id=lionking.htm| accessdate=17 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Disney later produced two related movies: a [[sequel]], ''[[The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]'', and a semi-[[prequel]], ''[[The Lion King 1Â½]]''.

==Production==
''The Lion King'' was originally called ''King of the Jungle'' during early stages of production.<ref name="kingofthejungle">{{cite web | work=The Lion King (1994) | title=The Lion King (1994) |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/| accessdate=12 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref> As in the case of the earlier film ''[[Bambi]]'', animators studied real-life animals for reference, and some of the filmmakers went to [[Kenya]] to observe the natural habitat that would be shown in the film.<ref>''The Lion King'': Platinum Edition DVD, (2003) Disc 2, 'Production Research Trip'</ref>

The film's significant use of computers helped the filmmakers to present their vision in new ways.  The most notable use of [[computer animation]] is in the "wildebeest stampede" sequence. Several distinct wildebeest characters were built in a 3D computer program, multiplied into the hundreds, [[cel shading|cel shaded]] to look like drawn animation, and given randomized paths down a mountainside to simulate the real, unpredictable movement of a herd. Similar multiplication occurs in the "Be Prepared" musical number with identical marching hyenas.<ref>''The Lion King'': Platinum Edition DVD, (2003) Disc 2, 'Computer Animation'</ref>

''The Lion King'' was once considered a secondary project to ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'', both of which were in production at the same time. Most of the Disney Feature Animation staff preferred to work on ''Pocahontas'', believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two.<ref>''The Lion King'': Platinum Edition DVD, (2003) Disc 2, 'Origins'</ref> However, when the two films were released, ''The Lion King'' received more positive feedback and bigger grosses than ''Pocahontas'' yet both were both critical and commercial sucesses.<ref name="rottentomatoestlk">{{cite web | work=Rotten Tomatoes | title=Rotten Tomatoes - The Lion King |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lion_king/| accessdate=24 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="rottentomatoespocahontas">{{cite web | work=Rotten Tomatoes | title=Rotten Tomatoes - ''Pocahontas'' |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1063809-pocahontas/| accessdate=17 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Plot==
[[Image:Lionkingopeningscene.JPG|270px|thumb|left|Rafiki holding Mufasa and Sarabi's newborn cub, Simba]]
The story of ''The Lion King'' takes place in the fictional Pride Lands of Africa, where a lion rules over the other animals as king.
 
At the beginning of the film, Rafiki, a [[mandrill]] [[shaman]], presents [[Simba]], the newborn cub of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi, to a gathering of animals at Pride Rock. Meanwhile, Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, realizes that he is no longer the heir to the throne and plots to kill Simba and Mufasa.

Scar plants curiosity in Simba about the [[elephant's graveyard|elephant graveyard]], a place beyond the borders of the Pride Lands where Mufasa has forbidden Simba to go. Simba takes his friend, Nala, to the elephant graveyard, where the cubs are chased by Shenzi, Banzai and Ed, Scar's [[spotted hyena]] minions, only to be rescued by Mufasa. Scar becomes angry as he intended for the hyenas to kill the cubs. Plotting further, Scar gathers more hyenas and buys their loyalty by claiming that if he were king they would never be without food. Later, Scar lures Simba into a gorge for a "surprise from his father," while the hyenas engineer a [[wildebeest]] stampede down into the gorge where Simba is. Alerted by an insincerely dramatic Scar, Mufasa races to rescue his son from the stampede, and after saving Simba, Mufasa is killed by Scar, who thwarts his attempted climb to safety over an edge of a cliff. Scar convinces Simba that that he was responsible for his own father's death, and recommends that he flee the Pride Lands, never to return. To compound this, Scar sends his hyena henchmen to kill Simba, but as Simba reaches a thorny embankment, the hyenas let him escape, hurling threats that he will be killed if ever seen again.  Informed that both Mufasa and Simba were killed, the pride regretfully allows Scar to assume the throne as the closest of kin.

Simba collapses in a distant desert, where he is found by Timon, a [[meerkat]], and Pumbaa, a [[warthog]], who adopt and raise Simba under their carefree "[[Hakuna Matata]]" lifestyle. When Simba is grown, he encounters his childhood friend Nala, who relays that Scar's tyrannical reign has devastated the Pride Lands. She demands that Simba return and take his rightful place as king, but Simba refuses, still guilty about supposedly causing his father's death. After some advice from Rafiki and the ghost of his father, Simba, followed by Timon and Pumbaa, returns home.

Once back at Pride Rock, Simba confronts his uncle and the truth about Mufasa's death is revealed by an overly confident Scar. A fierce battle breaks out between the lionesses and the hyenas while Simba fights Scar. In the midst of their fight, Scar tries to surreptitiously blame everything on the hyenas, but they overhear his conversation with Simba.  Simba eventually triumphs over his uncle and kicks him over a low cliff, where he is surrounded by the now resentful hyenas. The hyenas surround their traitorous fallen leader and kill him by devouring him alive.

With the rightful king in place, the Pride Lands are restored. The movie concludes with Rafiki lifting Simba and Nala's newborn cub high into the air, thus continuing the circle of life.

''The Lion King'' became the highest grossing film of 1994 worldwide, and the second highest in the USA (losing to ''[[Forrest Gump]]'').<ref name="movies">{{cite web | work= movies.com | title=Highest grossing movies of 1994 |url=http://movies.go.com/boxoffice?cat=1994| accessdate=18 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref>  The film initially made [[United States dollar|US$]]312,855,561 domestically, but including its 2002 [[IMAX]] re-release the domestic amount was $328,541,776.

It held the record for the most successful animated feature film in history until that record was broken by the computer animated ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' in 2003.  Since ''[[Shrek 2]]'' surpassed ''Nemo'''s gross in 2004, it now ranks third, still remaining the highest-grossing film using traditional animation. When adjusted for inflation, it is the fourth top-grossing animated film (below ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' and ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]'').

===Songs===
These are the musical numbers of the film, listed in order of appearance.

*'''"[[Circle of Life]]"''' is sung by an off-screen [[Carmen Twillie (actress) | Carmen Twillie]], with African vocals by [[Lebo M]] and his African choir. This song is played during the ceremony where a newborn Simba is presented to the animals of the Pride Lands.  The song is reprised at the end of the film.

*'''"Morning Report"''', a song originally not in the film (it was created for the live musical version), was added with an accompanying animated sequence in the 2003 Platinum Edition home video re-release.  Sung by [[Zazu]] ([[Jeff Bennett]]), [[Mufasa]] ([[James Earl Jones]]) and young [[Simba]] (Evan Saucedo), the song is an extension of the scene in the original film where Zazu delivers a morning report to Mufasa, and later gets pounced on by Simba.  

*'''"[[I Just Can't Wait to Be King]]"''' is sung by young Simba ([[Jason Weaver]]), young Nala (Laura Williams), and Zazu ([[Rowan Atkinson]]). Simba uses this musical number in the film to distract Zazu so that he and Nala can sneak off to the elephant graveyard, while expressing his wish to be king as soon as possible.

*'''"[[Be Prepared (song)|Be Prepared]]"''' is sung by Scar ([[Jeremy Irons]]/[[Jim Cummings]]), [[Shenzi, Banzai and Ed#Shenzi|Shenzi]] ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]), [[Shenzi, Banzai and Ed#Banzai|Banzai]] ([[Cheech Marin]]) and [[Shenzi, Banzai and Ed#Ed|Ed]] (Jim Cummings). In this song, Scar reveals to his hyena minions his plot to kill Mufasa and Simba.

*'''"[[Hakuna Matata (song)|Hakuna Matata]]"''' is sung by [[Timon and Pumbaa|Timon]] ([[Nathan Lane]]), [[Timon and Pumbaa|Pumbaa]] ([[Ernie Sabella]]) and Simba (Jason Weaver as a cub and [[Joseph Williams]] as an adult).  Timon and Pumbaa use this song as a warm welcome to Simba as he arrives at their jungle home, and to symbolize their "no worries" lifestyle. Simba grows into a young adult by the end of the song.

*'''"[[Can You Feel the Love Tonight]]"''' is a love song sung mainly by an off-screen Kristle Edwards, with Timon (Nathan Lane), Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella), adult Simba (Joseph Williams) and adult Nala ([[Sally Dworsky]]).  This musical sequence shows Timon and Pumbaa's frustration at Simba falling in love, and the development of Simba and Nala's romantic relationship. The song won the [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for Best Original Song during the [[67th Academy Awards]].

=== Soundtrack and other albums ===

{{main|The Lion King (soundtrack)}}

The film's original motion picture soundtrack was released on [[July 13]], [[1994]].

On [[February 28]], [[1995]], Disney released an album entitled ''[[Rhythm of the Pride Lands]]'', a sequel of sorts to the original soundtrack which featured songs and performances inspired by, but not featured in, the film.  Most of the tracks were composed by African composer Lebo M and focused primarily on the African influences of the film's original music, with most songs being sung either partially or entirely in various African languages. Several songs featured in the album would later have incarnations in other ''The Lion King''-oriented projects, such as the stage musical or the direct-to-video sequels (examples being "He Lives In You" used as the opening song for ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride''; and a reincarnation of "Warthog Rhapsody", called "That's All I Need", in ''The Lion King 1Â½''). ''Rhythm of the Pride Lands'' was initially printed in a very limited quantity. However, it was re-released in 2003 and included in some international versions of ''The Lion King'''s special edition soundtrack with an additional track.

==Sequels and spin-offs==
The success of the film led to several spin-offs, its first being a 70mm film released in 1995 entitled ''[[Circle of Life: An Environmental Fable]]''. It promoted environmental friendliness and was shown in the Harvest Theater in [[The Land (Disney)|The Land Pavilion]] at [[Epcot]] in [[Walt Disney World]]. Also debuted in 1995 was a spin-off television series called ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|The Lion King's Timon and Pumbaa]]'' which focused on the titular meerkat and warthog duo in a more modern, human world to the film's.

In addition, a [[direct-to-video]] sequel called ''[[The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]'' was released in 1998, focusing on Simba's daughter [[Kiara]]. Finally, a direct-to-video [[prequel]]/midquel, ''[[The Lion King 1Â½]]'' (also known as ''The Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata''), was released in 2004, showing the timeline of ''The Lion King'' from the perspective of Timon and Pumbaa.



==Home video==
''The Lion King'' was first released on [[VHS]] and [[laserdisc]] in the [[United States]] on [[March 3]], [[1995]], under [[Disney]]'s "[[Masterpiece Collection]]" video series. The VHS tape quickly became one of the best-selling videotapes of all time: 4.5 million tapes were sold on the first day.<ref name="homevideosellingfigures">{{cite web | work=ComingSoon.Net | title=''The Lion King'' home video selling figures|url=http://comingsoon.net/news.php?id=1818| accessdate=7 June|accessyear=2006}}</ref> In addition, Deluxe Editions of both formats were released. The VHS Deluxe Edition included the film, an exclusive lithograph of Rafiki and Simba (in some editions), a commemorative "Circle of Life" epigraph, six concept art lithographs, another tape with the half-hour TV show ''The Making of The Lion King'', and a certificate of authenticity. The CAV laserdisc Deluxe Edition also contained the film, six concept art lithographs and ''The Making of The Lion King'', but also included storyboards, character design artwork, concept art, rough animation, and a directors' commentary that the VHS edition did not have, on a total of four double sided disks. These home video versions of ''The Lion King'' all went into [[moratorium (entertainment)|moratorium]] in 1997.<ref name="homevideoinfo">{{cite web | work=Lionking.org | title=TLK on Home Video|url=http://www.lionking.org/homevideo.html| accessdate=24 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

On [[October 7]], [[2003]], the film was re-released on VHS and released on DVD for the first time as ''The Lion King: Platinum Edition'', as part of Disney's Platinum Edition line of animated classic DVDs. The DVD release featured a remastered version of the film created for the 2002 [[IMAX]] release and a second disc with bonus features. The film's soundtrack was available in its original Dolby 5.1 track or in a new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix. The DVD was the first of Disney DVDs to include the Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix.<ref name="DVDfeatures">{{cite web | work=disney.go.com | title=''The Lion King'' Special Edition DVD features|url=http://disneyvideos.disney.go.com/moviefinder/products/3038703.html#details| accessdate=18 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref> By means of [[seamless branching]], the film could be viewed either with or without a newly-created scene â a short conversation in the film replaced with a complete song, "The Morning Report". A Special Collector's Gift Set was also released, with the DVD set, five exclusive lithographed character portraits (new sketches created and signed by the original character animators), and an introductory book entitled ''The Journey''.<ref name="homevideoinfo">{{cite web | work=Lionking.org | title=TLK on Home Video|url=http://www.lionking.org/homevideo.html| accessdate=24 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref> More than two million copies of the Platinum Edition DVD and VHS units were sold on the first day of release.<ref name="homevideosellingfigures">{{cite web | work=ComingSoon.Net | title=''The Lion King'' home video selling figures|url=http://comingsoon.net/news.php?id=1818| accessdate=7 June|accessyear=2006}}</ref> A DVD boxed set of the three ''Lion King'' films (in two-disc Special Edition formats) was released on [[December 6]] [[2004]].

The Platinum Edition of ''The Lion King'' was criticized by fans mainly for its false advertising: producer [[Don Hahn]] had earlier stated that the film would be in its original 1994 theatrical version, but it was confirmed after release that it was the "digitally enhanced" IMAX version instead, which is slightly different than the original theatrical cut.<ref name="dvddifferences">{{cite web | work=UltimateDisney.com | title=The Lion King: Platinum Edition DVD Review (Page 2) which shows the differences between the film presented on the DVD and the original theatrical cut|url=http://www.ultimatedisney.com/thelionking2.html| accessdate=23 August|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

== Musical ==
{{main|The Lion King (musical)}}

The film was adapted into an award-winning [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theater|stage musical]] with the same title, directed by [[Julie Taymor]], and featured actors in representational animal costumes as well as [[banraku puppetry|banraku]] and [[shadow puppetry|shadow]] puppetry . The stage show first opened on [[July 31]], [[1997]] at the Orpheum Theatre in [[Minneapolis]] and was an instant success.  After opening on Broadway, the show was nominated for eleven [[Tony Awards]]; it won six, including Best Musical and Best Director. 

International productions, including a long-running production at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London]], are currently running to varied success.

== Controversies ==
===Story origin===
[[Image:Kimbasimba.JPG|thumb|290px|left|Comparison of ''Kimba the White Lion'' (left) and ''The Lion King'' (right).]]
{{main|Kimba the White Lion#The Lion King controversy}}
''The Lion King'' was originally advertised as being the first animated Disney film not based on an already-existing story. However, elements of the film bear a resemblance to a famous 1960s [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] [[television]] show, ''[[Kimba the White Lion]]''.<ref name="Kimba">{{cite web | work=Kimbawlion.com | title=Comparison screen-shots of ''The Lion King'' and ''Kimba the White Lion''|url=http://www.kimbawlion.com/rant2.htm| accessdate=7 June|accessyear=2006}}</ref>  The similarities include that the protagonists' names are alike (though Simba is Swahili for lion), that most characters in ''Kimba'' have an analogue in ''The Lion King'', and that various individual scenes are nearly identical in composition and camera angle. Disney's official stance is that any resemblance is coincidental, and directors [[Roger Allers]] and [[Rob Minkoff]] stated that they were well into the development process before the ''Kimba'' similarity was identified. Despite the resemblances between the film and the series, neither Disney nor the family of [[Osamu Tezuka]], ''Kimba'''s creator, has filed a lawsuit.

The filmmakers, however, admitted that the story of ''The Lion King'' was inspired by the 1942 Disney animated film ''[[Bambi]]'', the [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] and [[Moses]] stories from the [[Bible]], and [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]''.<ref name="storyinspiration">{{cite video | people = Don Hahn, Roger Allers, Rob Minkoff | title = The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 2)  | medium = DVD  | publisher = Walt Disney Home Video  | date = 2003}}</ref> [[Christopher Vogler]], in his book ''[[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers]]'', described Disney's request that he suggest how to improve the plot of ''The Lion King'' by incorporating ideas from ''Hamlet''.<ref name="mythicstructure">{{cite book | last=Vogler | first=Christopher | title=''The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers'' | date=1998}}</ref>

The plot also bears a resemblance to the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian myth of [[Osiris]] and [[Set (mythology)|Set]]. According to the myth, Set murdered his brother, Osiris, out of jealousy. [[Horus]], Osiris' son, later battled and defeated Set in a fight for the crown of Egypt. The plot also has certain elements of the African story of [[Sundiata]].

===Alleged subliminal message===
[[Image:lionkg2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The alleged "SEX" frame]]
In one scene of the film's original VHS release, it appears that the word "SEX" was embedded into several frames of animation,<ref name="The "SEX" frame">{{cite web | work=Snopes|title=The alleged "SEX" frame in ''The Lion King''|url=http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/lionking.htm| accessdate=1 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> which conservative activist [[Donald Wildmon]] asserted was a [[subliminal message]] intended to promote [[sexual promiscuity]]. However, the films' [[animator]]s have stated that the letters spell "SFX" (a common abbreviation of "special effects"), and was a sort of innocent "signature" signed by the effects animation team to the work they did.<ref name="sfx">{{cite web | work=Lionking.org FAQ: Hey!

The use of the song "[[The Lion Sleeps Tonight]]" in a scene with Timon and Pumbaa has led to disputes between Disney and the family of [[South Africa]]n [[Solomon Linda]], who composed the song (originally titled "Mbube") in 1939. In July 2004, the family filed suit, seeking $1.6 million in royalties from Disney. In February 2006, Linda's heirs reached a legal settlement with Abilene Music, who held the worldwide rights and had licensed the song to Disney for an undisclosed amount of money.<ref name="undisclosed">{{cite web | work=BBC news |title=Disney settles Lion song. dispute|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4721564.stm. | accessdate=31 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref>)

Due to its popularity, ''The Lion King'' has been referenced in various media.  For instance, in the animated TV series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' spoofed the film in the episode, "[['Round Springfield]]". Towards the end of the episode, the ghost of Mufasa appears in the clouds with [[Bleeding Gums Murphy]], [[Darth Vader]] and James Earl Jones, saying: "You must avenge my death, Kimba... dah, I mean Simba," a reference to the ''Lion King''/''Kimba the White Lion'' controversy.<ref name="simpsons">{{cite web | work=TV.com | title=A clip from the Simpsons episode 'Round Springfield' which parodied The Lion King|url=http://www.tv.com/media_player/1019/4/viewer.php?context_type=101&context_id=146| accessdate=23 August|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Disney has also referenced ''The Lion King'' in its own films. In the Disney-released, [[Pixar]]-produced 1995 computer animated film ''[[Toy Story]]'', the song "[[Hakuna Matata]]" can be heard playing in [[List of Toy Story characters#Andy Davis|Andy's]] car during the film's climax.<ref name="toystory">{{cite web | work=Easter Eggs | title=''Toy Story'' easter eggs|url=http://www.eeggs.com/items/46803.html| accessdate=10 February|accessyear=2007}}</ref>  Pumbaa made brief appearances in ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''<ref name="hunchback">{{cite web | work=The Internet Movie Database | title=''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' trivia|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116583/trivia| accessdate=27 August|accessyear=2006}}</ref> and ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'',<ref name="aladdin3">{{cite web | work=Disney Animation Kingdom - Jokes | title=''Aladdin and the King of Thieves'' in-jokes|url=http://disney.wretch.cc/Joke/aatkot.htm| accessdate=27 August|accessyear=2006}}</ref> both released in 1996. The 1997 animated film ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'' paid homage to both ''The Lion King'' and the [[Nemean Lion]]: Scar's skin is worn by Hercules while he is posing for a painting on a [[Greece|Greek]] vase.<ref name="hercules">{{cite web | work=Disney Animation Kingdom - Jokes | title=''Hercules'' in-jokes|url=http://disney.wretch.cc/Joke/c35.htm| accessdate=27 August|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Video games==
Two video games based on the film have been released. The first, entitled, ''[[The Lion King (video game)|The Lion King]]'', was published in 1994 by [[Virgin Group|Virgin]] and was released on [[NES]], [[SNES]], [[Game Boy]], [[Sega Master System]], [[Sega Mega Drive|Sega Genesis]], [[Game Gear]], [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[Amiga]]. The second, entitled ''[[The Lion King: Simba's Mighty Adventure]]'', was published in 2000 by Activision and was released on [[PlayStation]] and [[Game Boy Color]].

A third game was published in 2004 simply called ''The Lion King'' for [[Game Boy Advance]] in Europe and Asia, but was in fact a game based on the direct-to-video prequel/midquel ''[[The Lion King 1Â½]]'' with Timon and Pumbaa as the playable characters.

Part of the main plot of ''The Lion King'' is retold in the [[2005]] [[Square Enix]] [[PlayStation 2]] game ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''. The characters of the film appear in "Pride Lands", one of the many Disney "worlds" in the game. The plot is altered and new dialogue was recorded to accommodate the presence of the three main protagonists ([[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]], [[Donald Duck]] and [[Goofy]]).
