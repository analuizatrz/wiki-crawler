'''Jakub Karol Parnas''', also known as '''Yakov Oskarovich Parnas''' ({{lang-ru|Яков Оскарович Парнас}}) ([[January 16]], [[1884]] &ndash; [[January 29]], [[1949]]) was a prominent [[Poland|Polish]]–[[Soviet]] [[biochemist]] who contributed to the discovery of the [[Glycolysis|Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas]] pathway, together with [[Otto Fritz Meyerhof]] and [[Gustav Georg Embden]]. A collaborator with the [[Soviet]] regime since its invasion of Poland in 1939, he fell victim to a [[Stalinist]] [[purge]] in 1949.

==Biography==
Parnas was born in 1884 in [[Mokriany]] near [[Drohobych]], at that time part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], in the province of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] (now split between Poland and Ukraine), to [[Jewish]] parents. He graduated from the [[Technical University of Berlin|Royal Technical College of Charlottenburg]] in [[1904]]. From [[1920]] to [[1941]], he was head of the Institute of the Medical Chemistry at [[Lviv University]]. He traveled across Europe, collaborating with universities in [[Cambridge]], [[Naples]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Ghent]] and [[Zurich]]. He was a member of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]], [[Corresponding Member]] of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]], as well an honorary doctor of [[Sorbonne University]] and the [[University of Athens]].

After the [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet invasion of Poland]] and annexation of [[Western Ukraine]] in [[1939]] by the [[Soviet Union]], Parnas remained in [[Lviv]] to continue his work in the institute. He also started collaborating with the Soviet authorities by taking on a political role in the communist District [[Soviet]] Worker's Delegation. In [[1941]], after the [[German invasion of the Soviet Union]], Parnas was evacuated deeper into the USSR and remained there for the rest of his life. Only a few days after his departure [[Lviv]] was occupied by the [[Nazi Germany]] army, who [[massacre of Lwów professors|massacred]] approximately 45 Lwów professors. 

In the Soviet Union, Parnas met [[Joseph Stalin]], convinced him of his usefulness and shortly thereafter received his own laboratory. He became an [[Academician]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences of the USSR]] and a founding member of the [[Russian Academy of Medical Sciences|Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR]]. 

Despite his achievements and popularity, Parnas was falsely accused of being a spy of the [[West]] and arrested by the [[KGB]] on [[January 28]], [[1949]]. According to KGB's archives, he died during his first interrogation at [[Lubyanka (KGB)|Lubyanka prison]] from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on [[January 29]], [[1949]].

==Achievements==
Parnas's major work was the study of the mechanisms of [[carbohydrate]] [[metabolism]] in [[muscle]] tissue. Together with [[Władysław Baranowski]], he discovered the process of [[phosphorolysis]].<ref>http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1947/cori-lecture.pdf.</ref> Parnas also made a major contribution to the theoretical analysis of [[glycolysis]].

==Legacy==
Parnas is honored by the Polish–Ukrainian Parnas Conference organized by the Polish and Ukrainian
Biochemical Societies, which has been held every two years since 1999.
