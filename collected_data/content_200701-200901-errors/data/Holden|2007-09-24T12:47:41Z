'''Holden''', officially '''GM Holden Ltd''', is an [[Australia]]n [[automaker]] based in [[Port Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], originally independent but now a subsidiary of [[General Motors]] (GM).<ref name = "profile">{{Cite web | url = http://media.gm.com/aus/holden/en/company/facts/corp_profile.html | title = Corporate Profile | publisher = [[General Motors]] | accessdate = 2007-08-06}}</ref> The Holden automotive [[marque]] is one of GM's "alpha" brands. Holden has taken charge of vehicle operations for General Motors in [[Australasia]] and holds partial ownership of [[GM Daewoo]] in [[South Korea]] on behalf of GM.<ref>{{Cite web | date = [[2005-02-01]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=9144&vf=1 | title = Spanner in the works | publisher = [[The Sun-Herald]] | accessdate = 2007-07-07}}</ref>

Over the years, Holden has offered a broad range of locally produced vehicles, with supplementary models imported from various parts of the General Motors empire. In the past, Holden has offered [[Badge engineering|rebadged]] [[Nissan]] and [[Toyota]] models in sharing arrangements.<ref name = "milestones">{{Cite web | url = http://media.gm.com/aus/holden/en/company/history/history_milestones.html | title = Holden Company Milestones | publisher = [[General Motors]] | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref> 

Holden cars are manufactured at [[Elizabeth, South Australia]], while engines are produced at [[Port Melbourne, Victoria]].<ref name = "profile"/> Historically, production or assembly plants were operated in all mainland [[States and territories of Australia|states of Australia]]: [[Woodville, South Australia]] (body production only), [[Pagewood, New South Wales]], [[Dandenong, Victoria]], [[Acacia Ridge, Queensland]] and [[Mosman Park, Western Australia]]. Consolidation of all car production at Elizabeth, South Australia, was completed in 1988, although some assembly operations continued at Dandenong until the mid-1990s.<ref name = "milestones"/> The [[Holden New Zealand]] subsidiary opened an assembly plant based in [[Petone]], [[New Zealand]], in 1926, but manufacturing operations ceased after an announcement was made on [[April 26]] [[1990]] indicating local production would be phased out and vehicles would be imported [[Duty (economics)|duty]] free.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.holden.co.nz/heart/heritage/ | title = Heart of Holden - Holden Heritage | publisher = [[Holden New Zealand]] | accessdate = 2007-05-27}}</ref>

== History of the marque ==
=== Early history ===
In 1852 James Alexander Holden emigrated to [[South Australia]] from [[England]] and established '''J.A. Holden & Co''' in 1856, a saddlery business in [[Adelaide]].<ref name = "heritage1">{{Cite web | last = Kennedy | first = Alistair | coauthors = Kennedy, Ewan; Davis, Tony | url = http://media.gmcanada.com:8221/aus/holden/en/company/history/HH13Part1.pdf | title = The Holden Heritage - 13th Edition, part one | publisher = GM Holden Ltd | accessdate = 2007-05-09}}</ref> [[Edward Holden]], James' son, entered the firm in 1905 with a genuine interest in automobiles.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Hancock | first = Joan | coauthors = Richards, Eric | url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090705b.htm | title = Holden, Sir Edward Wheewall (1885 - 1947) | publisher = Australian Dictionary of Biography | accessdate = 2007-05-18}}</ref> From there, the firm evolved through various partnerships and in 1908, as Holden and Frost, moved into the business of minor repairs to car upholstery.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/history_holden.htm | title = Holden History | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref> The company began producing complete motorcycle sidecar bodies in 1913, and Edward experimented with fitting bodies to different types of carriages.<ref name = "milestones"/> After 1917, wartime trade restrictions led the company to commence full-scale production of vehicle body shells.

J.A. Holden incorporated a new company in 1919, '''Holden's Motor Body Builders Ltd''' (HMBB).<ref name = "heritage1"/> HMBB made bodies to suit a number of [[chassis]] imported from manufacturers such as [[Buick]] and [[Dodge]].<ref name = "milestones"/> In 1931 General Motors purchased the business and formed '''General Motorsâ€“Holden's Ltd'''.<ref name = "heritage1"/> Since then two name changes have occurred, the first in 1998 when the company became '''Holden Ltd''' and the second in May 2005 when it became '''GM Holden Ltd'''.<ref name = "heritage1"/>

=== Australia's own car ===
[[Image:48-215 launch.jpg|thumb|Launch of the first Holden in November 1948 by Prime Minister [[Ben Chifley]].]]
After the end of [[World War II]], the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] took steps to encourage an Australian automotive industry.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.holden.com.au/www-holden/jsp/corporateinfo/history/chifley.jsp | title = The Birth of 'Australia's Own Car' | publisher = GM Holden Ltd | accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref> While it is widely accepted that General Motors was the only automobile manufacturer to accept the challenge to build "Australia's Own Car", both [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and General Motors provided studies to the Australian Government of the day. Ford's long and complex document listed the impact and employment effects of a Ford-based vehicle and associated infrastructure, whereas GM's was a three-page list of the members of parliament and what each member would receive in "financial aid".<ref name = "NAA">{{Cite web | url = http://www.naa.gov.au/The_Collection/transport/road.html | title = Road transport | publisher = [[National Archives of Australia]] | accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref>

Holden's managing director [[Laurence Hartnett]] was particularly enthusiastic about developing and building an Australian car. The [[Holden 48-215|48-215]] (also unofficially called the FX), was developed and launched in 1948. The [[Mid-size car|mid-size]] 48-215 was fitted with a 132.5&nbsp;[[cubic inch]] (2,171&nbsp;cc) engine,<ref name = "heritage1"/> and its design was based on a previously rejected post-war [[Chevrolet]] proposal.<ref name = "drive">{{Cite web | last = Morley | first = David | date = [[2004-10-14]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/buy/TopTen/ChangedTheWorld.aspx | title = 10 cars that changed the world | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref> General Motors had rejected the design because the engine was deemed too small for the [[United States]] market.

=== 1950s: domination of the Australian market ===
During the 1950s, Holden dominated the Australian marketplace, offering buyers a combination of style, comfort, performance, economy, and value that no competitor could match.<ref name = "NAA"/><ref name = "heritage1"/> Less expensive four-cylinder cars did not offer Holden's ability to deal with rugged rural areas.<ref name = "NAA"/> Another factor in Holden's success was the large investment in production capacity, which allowed Holden to meet increased post-war demand for motor cars.<ref name = "milestones"/> [[Holden 48-215|48-215]] [[sedan]]s were produced in parallel with the [[Holden 50-2106|50-2106]] [[coupe utility]] from 1951, which was known [[Colloquialism|colloquially]] as the "Ute" and became ubiquitous in Australian [[rural]] areas as the workhorse of choice. Production continued with minor changes until 1953, when the Ute was replaced by the face-lifted [[Holden FJ|FJ]] model.<ref name = "ute">{{Cite web | date = [[2001-04-24]] | url = http://www.autoweb.com.au/cms/newsarticle.html?&start=70&showall=&id=HOL&doc=gmh0104242 | title = An Aussie Icon Turns 50 - The Holden Ute: 1951 - 2001 | publisher = Web Publications Pty Limited | accessdate = 2007-05-30}}</ref>

The FJ was the first major change to the Holden since its 1948 introduction. Over time it gained iconic status and remains one of Australia's most recognisable automotive symbols.<ref name = "heritage1"/> A new horizontally slatted radiator grille dominated the front-end of the FJ, which had other trim changes but no changes to the body panels.<ref name = "heritage1"/> Holden paid homage to the FJ with the [[Holden Efijy|Efijy]] [[concept car]] at the 2005 [[Australian International Motor Show]] in [[Sydney]].<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.rsportscars.com/eng/cars/holden_efijy.asp | title = 2005 Holden Efijy Concept | publisher = RSportsCars.com | accessdate = 2007-05-30}}</ref>

[[Image:Millionth Holden.JPG|thumb|left|The millionth Holden (an EJ) comes off the line at [[Dandenong, Victoria]] on [[October 25]] [[1962]].]]

While the FJ was little changed from the 48-215, marketing campaigns and price cuts kept vehicle sales steady until a completely redesigned model, the FE, was launched in 1956, and offered as a [[station wagon]] as well as a sedan. Mechanical components carried over from the FJ, but the appearance was very different. Strong sales continued in Australia, and Holden achieved a market share of more than 50 percent.<ref name = "ute"/>

=== 1960s: response to the challenge of competition ===
The 1960s brought further change to Holden. The company faced serious competition for the first time when its major competitors began to import cars from overseas. The decade opened with Holden offering its third major new model, the FB. Styling was inspired by 1957 Chevrolets, with [[tailfin]]s and a wrap-around [[windshield]] with "dog leg" [[Pillar (car)|A-pillars]]. By the time Holden introduced the FB in 1960, many considered the appearance dated. Much of the motoring industry at the time noted that the adopted styling did not translate well to the more compact Holden. The FB became the first Holden adapted for [[Driving on the left or right|left-hand drive]] markets, enhancing its export potential.<ref name = "heritage1"/>

In 1960, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] unveiled the new [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]] in Australia, only months after its introduction in the [[United States]], and soon after Holden introduced the FB. The Falcon's headlights were incorporated into the radiator grille, and [[automatic transmission]] was an option, but to Holden's advantage, the Falcon suffered from serious durability weaknesses, particularly in the front suspension. Early tests indicated that the Falcon was not well suited for [[Environment of Australia|Australian conditions]], and Falcon customers later agreed.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Mercer | first = Sandy | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_ford_falcon_xk.htm | title = Ford Falcon XK | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref> In response to the Falcon, Holden introduced the face-lifted EK in 1961, featuring two-tone paintwork, chrome trim,<ref name = "heritage1"/> and the option of automatic transmission. The EH, premiering in 1963, featured the new [[Holden Red motor|Red motor]], which improved vehicle performance over the previous [[Holden Grey motor|Grey motor]].<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/holden_red_motor.htm | title = Holden 6 Cylinder RED Motor | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-09}}</ref>

[[Image:1968-1971 Holden Brougham 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Holden Brougham]] (1968â€“1971) was Holden's first [[Full-size car|full-size]] [[luxury vehicle]]. Broughams were based on the mainstream [[Holden Kingswood|Kingswoods]] of the same years, but featured a lengthened rear body.]]

In February 1965 Holden introduced the HD,<ref name = "heritage1"/> which was quickly replaced by the face-lifted HR in April 1966 because the car's styling proved unpopular. The HR had new front and rear styling and higher capacity engines, and Holden sold in excess of 250,000 units over the two-year production run. In 1968, Holden introduced its next major new model, the HK.<ref name = "HK">{{Cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_hk.htm | title = Holden HK | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref> This included Holden's first [[V8 engine]], a [[Chevrolet]] engine imported from the United States.<ref name = "heritage2">{{Cite web | last = Kennedy | first = Alistair | coauthors = Kennedy, Ewan; Davis, Tony | url = http://media.gmcanada.com:8221/aus/holden/en/company/history/HH13Part2.pdf | title = The Holden Heritage - 13th Edition, part two | publisher = GM Holden Ltd | accessdate = 2007-05-09}}</ref> A long-wheelbase prestige model, the [[Holden Brougham|Brougham]], was based on the HK, and the first full-size two-door Holden, the [[Holden Monaro|Monaro]], was also based on the HK sedan.<ref name = "heritage2"/> The name "Monaro" is an [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] word meaning "higher ground" or "higher plain".<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.webwombat.com.au/motoring/news_reports/4_05_hold.htm | title = Monaro arriving this year | publisher = WebWombat Pty Ltd | accessdate = 2007-06-14}}</ref> The main-stream [[Holden Special]] was re-branded the [[Holden Kingswood|Kingswood]], and a basic [[Fleet vehicle|fleet model]] was introduced, known as the [[Holden Belmont|Belmont]].<ref name = "HK"/>

A face-lifted HK, known as the HT, was introduced in 1969. The exterior changes included a new radiator grille,<ref name = "HT">{{Cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_ht.htm | title = Holden HT | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref> new rear doors on [[sedan]]s (with larger windows), and new rear styling with a larger rear window, boot lid, and tail lights. Holden also introduced the first Australian designed and mass produced V8 engine, available in two capacities: 253&nbsp;cubic inch (4.2&nbsp;L) and 308&nbsp;cubic inch (5.0&nbsp;L).<ref name = "HT"/> The following year, Holden offered the HG: a lightly face-lifted car with a revised radiator grille, tail lights, interior trim, and colours. The HG's big selling point was its Tri-Matic three-speed automatic transmission, which Holden produced at its [[Woodville, South Australia]], factory.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_hg.htm | title = Holden HG | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref>

Despite the arrival of serious competitors in the 1960s, namely the Ford Falcon, [[Chrysler Valiant]], and the introduction of [[Japan]]ese cars, Holden's locally-produced large six- and eight-cylinder cars remained Australia's top-selling vehicles. Exports boosted sales of the Kingswood sedan, station wagon, and utility body styles to places such as [[Indonesia]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and [[South Africa]], where the vehicles were badged as the Chevrolet Kommando.<ref name = "heritage1"/>

[[Image:Holden Torana 1971.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Holden Torana|Torana]] was Holden's first [[compact car]], and had its origins in British [[Vauxhall Viva]]s of the mid-1960s.]]

==== Torana: the compact car ====
{{main|Holden Torana}}
The [[Holden Torana|Torana]] was Holden's first [[compact car]] in a market dominated by Japanese models. The name "Torana" is an [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] word meaning "to fly".<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_torana.htm | title = Holden Torana | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref> Since 1964, Holden had assembled the HA series [[Vauxhall Viva]], marketing the car as "Vivaâ€”the GMH small car" and de-emphasising the [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] brand. The first Torana, the HB, replaced the Viva in 1967, and Holden offered the LC, a Torana with new styling, in 1969. This was the first compact six-cylinder car in the Australian marketplace.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_torana_lc.htm | title = Holden Torana LC | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref> 

The next development of the Torana was the LH series, which was introduced in 1974.<ref name = "LH">{{Cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_torana_lh.htm | title = Holden Torana LH | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref> The LH was offered as a four-door sedan only, with a three-door hatchback variant added in the superseding LX series (manufactured between 1976 and 1978). The LH and LX series were offered with a wide range of engine choices, ranging from a 1.9&nbsp;litre four-cylinder, 2.8&nbsp;litre and 3.3&nbsp;litre six-cylinder or 4.2&nbsp;litre and 5.0&nbsp;litre eight-cylinder.<ref name = "LH"/> At the time, the Torana was the only car in the world to be offered with such a diverse range of engines, although the [[Chevrolet Nova]] offered this choice in the 1960s. The four-cylinder Torana later became the [[Holden Sunbird]], sold from 1974 to 1980.<ref name = "LH"/> And the UC series, which followed the LX in 1978, saw the demise of the V8 engine range.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_torana_uc.htm | title = Holden Torana UC | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-08-16}}</ref> 

The Torana departed from Holden's line-up in 1979, soon followed by the Sunbird in 1980. After the 1978 introduction of the [[Holden Commodore]], the Torana became the "in-between" car, squeezed out by the smaller and more economical [[Isuzu Gemini|Gemini]] and the larger, more sophisticated Commodore. The closest successor to the Torana was the [[Holden Camira]], released in 1982 as Australia's version of GM's medium-sized "[[GM J platform|J-Car]]".<ref name = "AutoBiography">{{Cite book | last = Robinson | first = Peter L. | title = AutoBiography | url = http://www.focus.com.au/ProductDetails.asp?ProdID=64 | publisher = Focus Publishing | year = 2006 | pages = 24 | isbn = 1921156104}}</ref> 

=== 1970s: from "Australia's Own" to the "World Car" ===
[[Image:Holden VB commodore 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]] followed the success of the [[Holden Kingswood|Kingswood]], becoming Holden's bestselling vehicle to date.]]

The 1970s opened with the launch of the new HQ series, often considered the most important new model since the original [[Holden 48-215]].<ref name = "heritage2"/> When the HQ was introduced, Holden was producing all of its passenger cars in Australia, and every model was of Australian design. However, by the end of the decade, Holden was producing cars based on overseas designs. The HQ was thoroughly re-engineered, featuring a perimeter frame and semi-[[monocoque]] (unibody) construction. This provided a level of refinement not seen in this class of vehicle before. Other firsts included a wide, 60&nbsp;[[inch]] (1,500&nbsp;mm) track, all-coil suspension, an extended wheelbase for station wagons, utilities and [[panel van]]s, and a new prestige brand, the [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman]], which also had a longer wheelbase.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/holden_HQ_technical_specifications.htm | title = Holden HQ Technical Specifications | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref> The HQ framework led to a new generation of two-door [[Holden Monaro|Monaros]],<ref name = "heritage2"/> and despite the introduction of the similar sized competitors, the HQ became the number one selling Holden of all time,<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_hq.htm | title = Holden HQ | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-07-11}}</ref> with 485,650 sales in three years.<ref name = "heritage2"/>

In 1975, Holden introduced the [[Holden Gemini|Gemini]], the Australian version of the "[[GM T platform|T-Car]]",<ref name = "heritage2"/> based on the [[Opel Kadett]] C.<ref name = "TX">{{Cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_gemini_tx.htm | title = Holden Gemini TX | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-11}}</ref> Not only was Gemini an overseas design, but it was developed jointly with [[Isuzu]], GM's Japanese affiliate.<ref name = "TX"/> A badge on the rear of the car identified it as a "Holden-Isuzu". The new car was powered by an Isuzu 1.6&nbsp;litre four-cylinder engine,<ref name = "TX"/> and its styling resembled that of the Kadett. Fast becoming a popular car, the Gemini rapidly attained sales leadership in its class, and the nameplate lived on until 1987.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_gemini_rb.htm | title = Holden Gemini RB | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-11}}</ref>

Holden's most popular car to date, the [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]], was first seen in 1978 with the introduction of the [[Holden VB Commodore|VB]].<ref>Robinson, p. 18</ref> Holden's new family car was loosely based on the [[Opel Rekord]] E body shell but with the front grafted on from the [[Opel Senator]] to accommodate the larger Holden six-cylinder and [[V8 engine]]s. Initially, Commodore maintained Holden's sales leadership in Australia.<ref>Robinson, p. 22â€“23</ref> However, some of the compromises resulting from the adoption of a design intended for another market hampered Commodore's acceptance. In particular, Commodore was narrower than its predecessor and the Falcon rival, which made it less comfortable for three rear-seat passengers. The Commodore was perceived as being smaller than the Falcon, which came at the expense of sales. The width problem was not resolved until the introduction of the wider [[Holden VN Commodore|VN]] in 1988, which became the first [[Full-size car|full-size]] Commodore.<ref>Robinson, p. 23, 26â€“27</ref>

[[Image:Holden LG Nova 01.jpg|thumb|left|The Holden-[[Toyota]] alliance led Holden to adopt badge engineered Toyotas and vice versa. The [[Toyota Corolla]] and [[Toyota Camry|Camry]] models were sold as the [[Holden Nova]] ''(pictured)'' and [[Holden Apollo|Apollo]] respectively.]]

=== 1980s: toughest decade ===
The 1980s were challenging for Holden and the Australian car industry. The [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] tried to revive the industry with the [[Button car plan]]. The plan encouraged car makers to focus on producing larger and more economic volumes of fewer models, and it provided incentives for exports.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Christie | first = Don | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3165/is_n9_v26/ai_8945968 | title = Automakers want to unbutton Australia - Sen.

Holden faced financial challenges as sales of the [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]] and [[Holden Gemini|Gemini]] declined. Competition from [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] intensified when the [[Ford Laser|Laser]], a compact car based on the [[Mazda 323]], and an updated [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]] proved popular. Other Australian manufacturers, [[Toyota]], [[Nissan]], and [[Mitsubishi Motors]] were also gaining market share.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Kenwright | first = Joe | url = http://editorial.carsales.com.au/car-review/1916079.aspx | title = Crossing the Lion (July 2006) | publisher = carsales.com.au Limited | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref> When Holden released the [[Holden Camira|Camira]] in 1982, a short run of good sales was followed by faltering numbers; buyers considered the 1.6&nbsp;litre engine to have inadequate power, and the car's reputation was tarnished by below average build and ride quality.<ref>Robinson, p. 24</ref>

In 1985, Holden's parent, General Motors, reorganised and recapitalised the business. At this time, the engine manufacturing and car manufacturing divisions were separated.<ref>Robinson, p. 27</ref> The engine manufacturing business was successful, building four-cylinder [[GM Family II engine]]s for use in cars built overseas.<ref>{{Cite web | date = [[2004-11-09]] | url = http://www.autoweb.com.au/cms/A_103082/index.html | title = Holden Reaches Golden Milestone With 50 Years Of Exports | publisher = Web Publications Pty Limited | accessdate = 2007-08-16}}</ref> Holden became the source of engines for the [[Vauxhall Cavalier]] and the [[Opel Ascona]] built in Europe. In the same year, the [[Holden Barina|Barina]] [[Supermini car|supermini]] was launched, becoming Holden's first truly small car.<ref name = "heritage2"/> The rebadged [[Suzuki Swift]] allowed Holden to broaden its market appeal.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Kennedy | first = Ewan | url = http://www.marque.com.au/usedcars/060306_Suzuki_Swift.htm | title = Suzuki Swift 1985-1999 | publisher = Marque Publishing Company | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref>

[[Image:Holden VN calais 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Holden VN Commodore|VN Commodore]] overcame the previous generation Commodore's width problems, and became a successful model for Holden.]]

In 1984, Holden introduced the [[Holden VK Commodore|VK Commodore]], with significant styling changes from the previous [[Holden VH Commodore|VH]]. The next update for the Commodore appeared in 1986 with the [[Holden VL Commodore|VL]], which had new front and rear styling.<ref name = "heritage2"/> Controversially, the VL was powered by the [[Nissan RB engine|Nissan RB30]] 3.0&nbsp;litre six-cylinder engine and had an electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. The change to the Nissan engine was necessitated by the legal requirement that all new cars sold in Australia after 1986 had to run on unleaded petrol.<ref>{{Cite web | date = [[2007-06-21]] | url = http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/environmental_management/air/caring_for_our_air/ | title = Caring for our air | publisher = [[Government of Queensland|The State of Queensland]] | accessdate = 2007-07-11}}</ref> It was not feasible to convert the six-cylinder engine to run on unleaded fuel, and the Nissan engine was chosen as representing the best engine available. However, because of the changing exchange rates over the life of the VL, the cost of the Nissan engines doubled.<ref>Robinson, p. 25</ref> The final phase of the Commodore's recovery strategy involved the 1988 [[Holden VN Commodore|VN]]. The VN was significantly wider than before, and it was powered by the American-designed 3.8&nbsp;litre [[Buick V6 engine]].<ref>Robinson, p. 23, 26&ndash;27</ref>

=== 1990s: comeback years ===
This decade saw Holden's transformation continue. By the end of the decade, Holden was a confident and successful participant in the Australian car industry, as well as having a place on the world automotive stage. Besides manufacturing Australia's bestselling car, which was exported in significant numbers, many of the Holden's locally produced engines continued to be sent abroad to power cars made outside Australia. In this decade, Holden adopted a strategy of importing cars it needed to offer a full range of competitive vehicles.<ref>{{Cite web | url =

In 1990 Holden revitalised the wide-body Commodore, which was significantly more successful than its predecessor. The defunct [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman]] brand was reintroduced, but the models were sold as the [[Holden Statesman]] and [[Holden Caprice|Caprice]]. As well as the prestige variants, the [[Holden Ute|Ute]] made a return.<ref>Robinson, p. 26&ndash;27</ref> The [[Buick]] sourced [[Buick V6 engine|3.8&nbsp;litre V6 engine]], produced locally, provided power for the Commodore range, and the 5.0&nbsp;litre V8 engine was replaced in 1999.<ref name = "heritage3">{{Cite web | url = http://media.gmcanada.com:8221/aus/holden/en/company/history/HH13Part3.pdf | title = The Holden Heritage - 13th Edition, part three | publisher = GM Holden Ltd | accessdate = 2007-05-09}}</ref> 

The UAAI badge-engineered cars fared poorly, although the Holden Commodore, [[Toyota Camry]], and [[Toyota Corolla|Corolla]] were all successful when sold under their original nameplates. Potential customers could see the "copies" were thinly disguised versions of popular cars, and purchased the vehicles from the original manufacturer.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/60DB5F93CC0B207FCA256D21001310D6 | title = Car review - Holden Nova 5-dr hatch | publisher = John Mellor Pty Ltd | accessdate = 2007-05-13}}</ref> In 1996, UAAI was dissolved, and Holden returned to products from within GM rather than from competitors.<ref>Robinson, p. 27</ref> The Toyota-sourced [[Holden Nova|Nova]] and [[Holden Apollo|Apollo]] were replaced with the [[Holden Astra]] and [[Holden Vectra|Vectra]], both of which designed by [[Opel]] in [[Germany]]. Assembly of Vectra began at [[Elizabeth, South Australia]] in 1998, and these cars were exported to [[Japan]] and [[Southeast Asia]] with Opel badges.<ref>{{Cite web | date = [[1999-09-08]] | url = http://autoweb.com.au/cms/article.html?&A=51613 | title = Holden Announces Next Stage Of $1 Billion Export Drive | publisher = Web Publications Pty Limited | accessdate = 2007-09-07}}</ref><ref name = "heritage1"/> However, the Vectra did not achieve sufficient sales in Australia to justify local assembly and reverted to being fully imported in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/8FECAC2A36315B23CA256D65001A367C | title = Car review - Holden Vectra CDXi 5-dr hatch | publisher = John Mellor Pty Ltd | accessdate = 2007-05-13}}</ref> In 1994, the [[Opel Corsa]] replaced the already available [[Suzuki Swift]] as the source for the [[Holden Barina]].<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/D928D7E37EE64519CA256D210003F9D7 | title = Car review - Holden Barina Swing 5-dr hatch | publisher = John Mellor Pty Ltd | accessdate = 2007-05-13}}</ref>

In August 1997 the all-new [[Holden VT Commodore|VT Commodore]] was introduced; it was the outcome of an [[Australian dollar|AU$]]600 million development programme that spanned more than half a decade. The new model sported a rounded exterior body shell, improved dynamics, and many 'firsts' for an Australian-built car. A stronger body structure contributed to gains in crash safety, and in late 1997, just months after its introduction, it was crowned ''[[Wheels Car of the Year]]''.<ref name = "WheelsVEMag">{{Citation | last = Newton | first = Bruce | last2 = Robinson | first2 = Peter | last3 = McCarthy | first3 = Mike | last4 = McKay | first4 = Peter | title = 2006 Collector's Edition VE Commodore: The Full Story | publisher = [[Australian Consolidated Press]] | journal = [[Wheels magazine]] | pages = 158 | date = October 2006}}</ref> A revived Monaro, based on the VT Commodore, attracted wide attention after being shown as a [[concept car]] at Australian [[motor show]]s, and it drew a large waiting list after it was put into production. The revived Monaro was released to the Australian market in October 2001 and ceased production in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_monaro.htm | title = Holden Monaro | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | date = [[2005-07-21]] | url = http://www.webwombat.com.au/motoring/news_reports/holden-monaro-cv8-z.htm | title = Holden Waves Goodbye to Monaro | publisher = WebWombat Pty Ltd | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref>

[[Image:2007 Holden VE Commodore Omega 01.jpg|thumb|The 2006 [[Holden VE Commodore]] was the first vehicle Holden had completely designed and engineered in Australia since 1971.]]

=== 2000s: Daewoo and the all-new Commodore ===
Holden's trend of importing many of their models from [[Opel]] in [[Germany]] continued throughout the first half of the 2000s, but Holden looked to the GM-owned [[GM Daewoo|Daewoo]] in [[South Korea]] for replacements to increase profitability.<ref>{{Cite web | last = McKinnon | first = Bill | date = [[2005-11-25]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=10699 | title = Holden Barina | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-05-14}}</ref> Holden had already established close research and design links with Daewoo, with whom it exported the large [[Holden Statesman|Statesman]] model. In 2005, the [[Opel]]-sourced [[Holden Barina]] was replaced by the [[Daewoo Kalos]], which continued to be sold under the Barina nameplate.<ref>{{Cite web | date = [[2006-01-14]] | url = http://carsguide.news.com.au/story/0,20384,17835536-27286,00.html | title = New Barina's price calms sentiment | publisher = [[The Courier-Mail]] | accessdate = 2007-03-05}}</ref> The entry-level [[Holden Astra]] Classic was replaced by the Holden Viva, based on the [[Daewoo Lacetti]].<ref name = "JF">{{Cite web | date = [[2006-10-26]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=10699 | title = Holden Viva Hatch | publisher = [[The Australian]] | accessdate = 2007-05-14}}</ref> The European-sourced Astra nameplate continued but was sold as a more up-market model.<ref name = "JF"/> In 2006 Holden begun selling the [[Holden Captiva]], a [[Crossover SUV]] manufactured by Daewoo with Australian-built versions of the [[Alloytec#Holden 3.2|Alloytec V6 engine]].<ref>{{Cite web | last = Stevens | first = Samantha | date = [[2006-10-10]] | url = http://carsguide.news.com.au/story/0,20384,20562133-5003140,00.html | title = Holden Captiva: imported SUV | publisher = [[The Sunday Telegraph]] | accessdate = 2007-05-14}}</ref> The third Holden model to be replaced with a South Korean alternative was the [[Opel Vectra|Vectra]], surpassed by the [[Mid-size car|mid-size]] [[Daewoo Tosca|Epica]] in April 2007.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Porter | first = Ian | date = [[2007-01-31]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=23056&vf=1 | title = Tosca sweetens Holden range | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-05-14}}</ref>

The 1997 [[Holden VT Commodore|VT Commodore]] received its first major update in 2002 with the [[Holden VY Commodore|VY]],<ref name = "heritage3"/> and in 2006 Holden launched the new [[Holden VE Commodore|VE]].<ref>{{Cite web | date = [[2006-07-15]] | url = http://www.caradvice.com.au/528/holden-ve-commodore-launch/ | title = Holden VE Commodore Launch | publisher = CarAdvice.com.au Pty Ltd | accessdate = 2007-05-06}}</ref> The VE was the first Commodore model with all-Australian origins, as opposed to previous generations' Opel-sourced [[Automobile platform|platforms]] adapted both mechanically and in size for the local market.<ref>Robinson, p. 12</ref>

Operations at Holden are currently headed by [[chairman]] and managing director [[Chris Gubbey]]. Executives of secondary departments include William Lesner, Alison Terry, Ian McCleave, Tony Hyde, Tony Stolfo, Alan Batey, Rodney Keane, Scott Sandefur, Pierre Matthee, Gene Stefanyshyn, Raymundo Garza, Mark Bernhard, and Fiona Harden.<ref name = "profile"/> Vehicles are sold countrywide through the Holden Dealer Network (310 authorised stores and 12 service centres), which employs more than 13,500 people.<ref name = "profile"/>

Since the 1960s, Holdens have been a staple of domestic [[touring car racing]], and the quasi-factory [[Holden Racing Team]] (HRT) has successfully participated in [[V8 Supercar]] racing.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.hsv.com.au/racing/2004/history/history.htm | title = Holden Racing Team History | publisher = Holden Special Vehicles | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref> In 1987, [[Holden Special Vehicles]] (HSV) was formed in partnership with Tom Walkinshaw, who primarily manufactures modified, high-performance Commodore variants.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.hsv.com.au/studentpack/spackhistory.htm | title = HSV History & Background | publisher = Holden Special Vehicles | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref> To further reinforce the brand, HSV introduced the [[Toll HSV Dealer Team]] into the V8 Supercar fold in 2005 under the naming rights of HSV Toll Racing.<ref>{{Cite web | date = [[2005-11-21]] | url = http://www.hsvdt.com.au/hsvdt_new/2006/news/toll_hsvdt_release.asp | title = Toll and HSV Dealer Team confirm V8 Supercar alliance | publisher = Toll HSV Dealer Team | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref>

The logo or "Holden lion and stone" as it is known, has played a vital role in establishing Holden's identity with roots tracing back to 1928. It was then when George Raynor Hof was appointed by Holdenâ€™s Motor Body Builders to design the emblem. The fable behind the logo dates back to [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] times when observations were made of [[lion]]s rolling stones, leading to the invention of the wheel. With the 1948 launch of the [[Holden 48-215|48-215]], Holden revised its logo and commissioned yet another redesign in 1972 to better represent the company.<ref>{{Citation | last = Wright | first = John | title = Badgeology | year = 2004 | magazine = [[Wheels magazine]] May 2004 | pages = 152}}</ref> The emblem was reworked once more in 1994.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.holden.com.au/www-holden/jsp/corporateinfo/history/history.jsp?link=symbol | title = The Story of the Holden Lion | publisher = GM Holden Ltd | accessdate = 2007-07-12}}</ref>

=== Export markets ===
The Holden Commodore is just as popular in [[New Zealand]], where it has hit the number-one slot in the sales charts from time to time, and is often used as a police car. Commodores have also been sold in [[South Africa]] and [[Thailand]] and are currently marketed in parts of the [[Middle East]] badged as [[Chevrolet Lumina (Australia)|Chevrolet Luminas]]. In [[Brazil]] badge-engineered Commodores are sold as the [[Chevrolet Omega]], and both V6 and V8 versions of the Commodore will be exported to the United States as the [[Pontiac G8]] starting in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Butler | first = Glenn | date = [[2007-05-06]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=29015 | title = Holden confirms Pontiac deal | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-05-06}}</ref> Holden's exports to the Middle East and Brazil were the first [[Driving on the left or right|left-hand drive]] cars built since the 1960s, when Holden sold cars in [[Hawaii]].<ref name = "heritage1"/>

A modified version of the [[Holden Monaro]] (in turn a modified Commodore) has been sold in the [[United States]] as the [[Pontiac GTO]] and its model name through [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] dealerships in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name = "heritage1"/> Vauxhall has commenced sales of the HSV Clubsport R8, badged as the [[Vauxhall VXR8]].<ref>{{Cite web | last = Thorp | first = Chris | date = [[2007-03-06]] | url = http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/news/autoexpressnews/205692/vauxhall_vxr8.html | title = Vauxhall unleashes all-new supersaloon | publisher = Dennis Publishing Limited | accessdate = 2007-07-23}}</ref> Since the late 1990s, Holden has exported its luxury [[Holden Statesman|Statesman]] sedan to the Middle East as the [[Chevrolet Caprice (Australia)|Chevrolet Caprice]] and to South Korea as the [[Daewoo Statesman]].
