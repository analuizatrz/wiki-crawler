'''''Helicobacter pylori''''' is a [[helix|helical]] shaped [[Gram-negative]] [[bacterium]] that [[infection|infects]] various areas of the [[stomach]] and [[duodenum]]. Many cases of [[peptic ulcer]]s, [[gastritis]], and [[duodenitis]] are caused by ''H. pylori'' infection.  However, many who are infected do not show any symptoms of [[disease]].  ''Helicobacter spp.'' are the only known microorganisms that can thrive in the highly [[acid]]ic environment of the stomach.  Its helical shape (from which the [[genus]] name is derived) is thought to have evolved to penetrate and favor its [[motility]] in the [[mucus]] gel layer.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.1336 Chapter 23: ''Campylobacter'' and ''Helicobacter''] from [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed ''Medical Microbiology'', 4th ed.], by Samuel Baron (editor), 1996</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of peptic ulcer disease and Helicobacter pylori}}

In 1875, [[Germany|German]] scientists found helical shaped bacteria in the lining of the human stomach.  The bacteria could not be grown in culture and the results were eventually forgotten.<ref name=Blaser_2005>{{cite journal|author=Blaser MJ|title=An Endangered Species in the Stomach|journal=[[Scientific American]]|year=2005|volume=292|issue=2|pages=38–45|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00024948-2764-11E8-A28583414B7F0000&ref=sciam&chanID=sa006|id=PMID 15715390}}</ref> 

In 1892, the [[Italy|Italian]] researcher [[Giulio Bizzozero]] described helical shaped bacteria living in the acidic environment of the stomach of dogs.

Professor [[Walery Jaworski]] of the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]] investigated sediments of gastric washings obtained from humans in 1899. Among some rod-like bacteria, he also found bacteria with a characteristic helical shape, which he called ''Vibrio rugula''. He was the first to suggest a possible role of this organism in the pathogeny of gastric diseases. This work was included in the "Handbook of Gastric Diseases" but it did not have much impact as it was written in Polish.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Konturek JW|title=Discovery by Jaworski of Helicobacter pylori and its pathogenetic role in peptic ulcer, gastritis and gastric cancer|journal=J Physiol Pharmacol. |year=2003 Dec|volume=54 Suppl 3|pages=23–41|url=http://www.jpp.krakow.pl/journal/archive/1203_s3/articles/03_article.html|id=PMID 15075463}}</ref>

The bacterium was rediscovered in 1979 by [[Australia]]n pathologist [[Robin Warren]], who did further research on it with [[Barry Marshall]] beginning in 1981; they isolated the organisms from mucosal specimens from human stomachs and were the first to successfully culture them.<ref>[http://www.tallpoppies.net.au/cavalcade/marshall.htm Barry Marshall biography], The Tall Poppy Campaign. Accessed 9 September 2006.</ref> In their original paper,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Marshall BJ|title=Unidentified curved bacillus on gastric epithelium in active chronic gastritis|journal=[[Lancet]]|year=1983|volume=1|issue=8336|pages=1273–1275|id=PMID 6134060}}</ref> Warren and Marshall contended that most stomach ulcers and gastritis were caused by infection by this bacterium and not by [[stress (medicine)|stress]] or [[spicy food]] as had been assumed before.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Marshall BJ, Warren JR|title=Unidentified curved bacilli in the stomach patients with gastritis and peptic ulceration|journal=Lancet|year=1984|volume=1|issue=8390|pages=1311–1315|id=PMID 6145023}}</ref>

The medical community was slow to recognize the role of this bacterium in stomach ulcers and gastritis, believing that no microorganism could survive for long in the acidic environment of the stomach.  The community began to come around after further studies were done, including one in which Marshall drank a Petri dish of ''H. pylori'', developed gastritis, and the bacteria were recovered from his stomach lining, thereby satisfying three out of the four [[Koch's postulates]]. The fourth was satisfied after a second endoscopy ten days after inoculation revealed signs of gastritis and the presence of "H. pylori".  Marshall was then able to treat himself using a fourteen day dual therapy with bismuth salts and metronidazole. Marshall and Warren went on to show that antibiotics are effective in the treatment of many cases of gastritis. In 1994, the [[National Institutes of Health]] (USA) published an opinion stating that most recurrent gastric ulcers were caused by ''H. pylori'', and recommended that antibiotics be included in the treatment regimen.<ref>{{cite web|title=Helicobacter pylori in peptic ulcer disease|work=NIH Consensus Statement Online Jan 7–9;12(1):1-23|accessdate=2004-12-21|url=http://consensus.nih.gov/1994/1994HelicobacterPyloriUlcer094html.htm}}</ref>   Evidence has been accumulating to suggest that duodenal ulcers are also associated with ''H. pylori'' infection.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Pietroiusti A, Luzzi I, Gomez MJ, Magrini A, Bergamaschi A, Forlini A, Galante A.|title=Helicobacter pylori duodenal colonization is a strong risk factor for the development of duodenal ulcer.|month=April|year=2005|id=PMID 15801926}}</ref><ref>[http://gut.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/52/6/797 Helicobacter pylori infection induces duodenitis and superficial duodenal ulcer in Mongolian gerbils]</ref> In 2005, Warren and Marshall were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] for their work on ''H. pylori''.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/2005/index.html The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2005] awarded to Barry J. Marshall and J. Robin Warren "for their discovery of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease".</ref>

Before the appreciation of the bacterium's role, stomach ulcers were typically treated with medicines that neutralize [[gastric acid]] or decrease its production. While this worked well, the ulcers very often reappeared. A very often used medication against gastritis and peptic ulcers was [[bismuth subsalicylate]]. It was often effective, but fell out of use, since its mechanism of action was a mystery.  Nowadays it is quite clear that it is due to the bismuth salt acting as an antibiotic. Today, many stomach ulcers are treated with antibiotics effective against ''H. pylori''.

The bacterium was initially named '''''Campylobacter pyloridis''''', then '''''C. pylori''''' (after a correction to the [[Latin grammar]]) and in 1989, after [[DNA sequencing]] and other data showed that the bacterium did not belong in the ''[[Campylobacter]]'' genus, it was placed in its own [[genus]], ''[[Helicobacter]]''.  The name ''pylori'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''pylorus'', which means [[gatekeeper]], and refers to the [[pyloric valve]] (the circular opening leading from the stomach into the [[duodenum]]). 

While ''H. pylori'' remains the most medically important bacterial inhabitant of the human stomach, other species of the ''Helicobacter'' genus have been identified in other [[mammal]]s and some [[bird]]s, and some of these can infect humans.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} ''Helicobacter'' species have also been found to infect the [[liver]]s of certain mammals and to cause liver disease.<ref name=Starzyñska_2006>{{cite journal |author=Starzyñska T, Malfertheiner P |title=''Helicobacter'' and digestive malignancies |journal=Helicobacter |volume=11 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=32-5 |year=2006 |id=PMID 16925609}}</ref>

==Structure==
''H. pylori'' is a helical shaped [[Gram-negative]] bacterium, about [[1 E-6 m|3 micrometres]] long with a diameter of about 0.5 micrometre. It has 4&ndash;6 [[flagellum|flagella]]. It is [[microaerophilic]], i.e. it requires [[oxygen]] but at lower levels than those contained in the [[earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. It contains a [[hydrogenase]] which can be used to obtain energy by oxidizing molecular [[hydrogen]] (H<sub>2</sub>) that is produced by other intestinal bacteria.<ref>Jonathan W. Olson and Robert J. Maier. Molecular Hydrogen as an energy source for Helicobacter pylori. ''Science'' 298.5599 (Nov 29, 2002): pp.1788–1790. PMID 12459589</ref> It tests positive for [[oxidase test|oxidase]], [[catalase]], and [[urease]]. It is capable of forming [[biofilm]]s<ref>{{cite journal|author=Stark RM, Gerwig GJ, Pitman RS, Potts LF, Williams NA, Greenman J, Weinzweig IP, Hirst TR, Millar MR |title=Biofilm formation by Helicobacter pylori.|year=1999|id=PMID 10063642}}</ref> and conversion from helical to [[coccus|coccoid]] form<ref>{{cite journal|author=Chan WY, Hui PK, Leung KM, Chow J, Kwok F, Ng CS|title=Coccoid forms of Helicobacter pylori in the human stomach.|year=1994|id=PMID 7524304}}</ref>, both likely to favor its survival and be factors in the [[epidemiology]] of the bacterium.  The coccoid form of the organism has not been cultured, but has been found in the water supply in the US. This form has also been found to be able to adhere to gastric epithelial cells ''[[in vitro]]''.

[[Image:Helicobacter Pylori Urease.png|thumb|250px|Molecular model of ''H. pylori'' urease enzyme]]

==Colonization==

With its flagella, the bacterium moves through the stomach lumen and drills into the mucus gel layer of the stomach.  It then finds ways to live in various areas of the stomach. The known areas include: inside the mucus gel layer (with a preference for the superficial area), above epithelial cells, and inside [[vacuole]]s formed by ''H. pylori'' in epithelial cells. It produces [[adhesin]]s which bind to membrane-associated lipids and carbohydrates and help its adhesion to epithelial cells. It produces large amounts of urease enzymes which are localized inside and outside of the bacterium.  Urease metabolizes [[urea]] (which is normally  secreted into the stomach) to [[carbon dioxide]] and [[ammonia]] which neutralizes gastric acid. The survival of ''H. pylori'' in the acidic stomach is dependant on urease and eventually dies without it.  The ammonia that is produced is toxic to the epithelial cells, and with other products of ''H. pylori'', including [[protease]], [[catalase]], and [[phospholipase]]s, causes damage to those cells. 

Some strains of the bacteria have a particular mechanism for "injecting" the [[inflammation|inflammatory]] inducing agent [[peptidoglycan]] from their own [[cell wall]] into epithelial stomach cells. (See below for "cagA pathogenicity island" in the section [[Helicobacter pylori#Genome studies of different strains|Genome studies of different strains]]) This factor may play a role in allowing certain strains to invade host tissue.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Viala, Jérôme; Chaput, Catherine; Boneca, Ivo G; Cardona, Ana; Girardin, Stephen E; Moran, Anthony P; Athman, Rafika; Memet, Sylvie; Huerre, Michel R; Coyle, Anthony J; DiStefano, Peter S; Sansonetti, Philippe J; Labigne, Agnès; Bertin, John; Philpott, Dana J; Ferrero, Richard L|title=Nod1 responds to peptidoglycan delivered by the ''Helicobacter pylori'' cag pathogenicity island|journal=Nature Immunol|year=2004|volume=5|pages=1166–74|url=http://www.nature.com/ni/journal/v5/n11/abs/ni1131.html|id={{doi|10.1038/ni1131}}, PMID 15489856}}</ref>

==Treatment of infection==
[[image:pylorigastritis.jpg|thumb|300 px|''H. pylori'' colonized on the surface of regenerative epithelium (Warthin-Starry's silver)]]
In [[peptic ulcer]] patients where infection is detected, the normal procedure is eradicating ''H. pylori'' to allow the ulcer to heal. The standard first-line therapy is a one week ''triple therapy''. The Sydney gastroenterolgist [[Thomas Borody]] invented the first triple therapy in 1987.<ref name=Borody_1989>{{cite journal | last = Borody | first = Thomas J. | coauthors = | P. Cole, S.

Unfortunately, an increasing number of infected individuals are found to harbour [[antibiotic resistance|antibiotic-resistant]] bacteria. This results in initial treatment failure and requires additional rounds of antibiotic therapy or alternative strategies such as a quadruple therapy.   [[Bismuth]] compounds are also effective in combination with the above drugs. For the treatment of [[clarithromycin]]-resistant strains of ''H. pylori'' the use of [[levofloxacin]] as part of the therapy has been suggested.

Some studies show that consumption of [[broccoli]] sprouts can be effective at inhibiting ''H. pylori'' growth<ref>{{cite journal|author=Galan MV, Kishan AA, Silverman AL|title=Oral broccoli sprouts for the treatment of ''Helicobacter pylori'' infection: a preliminary report|journal=Dig Dis Sci.|month=August | year = 2004|volume=49|issue=7–8|pages=1088–90|id=PMID 15387326}}</ref> with [[sulforaphane]] being at least one of the active agents<ref>{{cite journal|author=|title=Sulforaphane inhibits extracellular, intracellular, and antibiotic-resistant strains of Helicobacter pylori and prevents benzo[a]pyrene-induced stomach tumors.|author=Fahey JW, Haristoy X, Dolan PM, Kensler TW, Scholtus I, Stephenson KK, Talalay P, Lozniewski A|year=2002|month=May|id=PMID 12032331}}</ref>.

Some studies show that [[mastic]] gum can destroy ''H. pylori'' ''[[in vitro]]'', but studies done ''[[in vivo]]'' have shown it to be ineffective.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&term=%22gum+mastic%22%5BSubstance+Name%5D+AND+%22Helicobacter+pylori%22%5BMeSH%5D PubMed search for "gum mastic" and "H. pylori"], accessed 9 September 2006.</ref>

A study done on Mongolian gerbils indicates that [[green tea]] extract can suppress ''H. pylori'' growth.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Matsubara S, Shibata H, Ishikawa F, Yokokura T, Takahashi M, Sugimura T, Wakabayashi K.|title=Suppression of Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis by green tea extract in Mongolian gerbils.|month=October |year = 2003|id=PMID 14550260}}</ref> Another study done in South Korea suggests that an acidic [[polysaccharide]] found in green tea is significantly effective in preventing adhesion of ''H. pylori'' to human cultures of epithelial cells.<ref name=Lee_2006>{{cite journal |author=Lee J, Shim J, Lee J, Kim J, Yang I, Chung M, Kim K |title=Inhibition of pathogenic bacterial adhesion by acidic polysaccharide from green tea (Camellia sinensis) |journal=J Agric Food Chem |volume=54 |issue=23 |pages=8717–23 |year=2006 |id=PMID 17090112}}</ref>

As [[#Acid reflux and esophageal cancer|explained below]], some authors suggest that some strains of ''H. pylori'' may be protective against certain diseases of the esophagus and cardia. Therefore, a more cautious approach than complete eradication may be necessary in some cases.

==Gastric cancer association==
[[Gastric cancer]] and gastric [[MALT lymphoma]] (lymphoma of the [[mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue]]) have been associated with ''H. pylori'', and the bacterium has been categorized as a group I [[carcinogen]] by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC). While the association is reasonably strong, it is not entirely clear that there is a [[causality|causal]] relationship involved.

Two related mechanisms by which ''H. pylori'' could promote cancer are under investigation. One mechanism involves the enhanced production of [[free radical]]s near ''H. pylori'' and an increased rate of host cell [[mutation]]. The other proposed mechanism has been called a "perigenetic pathway"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Tsuji S, Kawai N, Tsujii M, Kawano S, Hori M|title=Review article: inflammation-related promotion of gastrointestinal carcinogenesis - a perigenetic pathway|journal=Aliment Pharmacol Ther|year=2003|volume=18|issue=Suppl 1|pages=82–9|id=PMID 12925144}}</ref> and involves enhancement of the transformed host cell phenotype by means of alterations in cell [[protein]]s such as [[cell adhesion|adhesion]] proteins. It has been proposed that ''H. pylori'' induces [[inflammation]] and locally high levels of [[TNF-alpha]] and/or [[interleukin 6]]. According to the proposed perigenetic mechanism, inflammation-associated signaling molecules such as TNF-alpha can alter gastric epithelial cell adhesion and lead to the dispersion and migration of mutated epithelial cells without the need for additional mutations in [[tumor suppressor gene]]s such as genes that code for cell adhesion proteins.

==Acid reflux and esophageal cancer==
The infection rate with ''H. pylori'' has been decreasing in developing countries, presumably because of improved hygiene and increased use of antibiotics. Accordingly, the incidence of gastric cancer in the U.S. has fallen by 80 percent from 1900 to 2000. However, [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] and [[esophageal cancer]] have increased dramatically during the same period. In 1996, [[Martin J. Blaser]] put forward the theory that ''H. pylori'' might also have a beneficial effect: by regulating the acidity of the stomach contents, it lowers the impact of regurgitation of gastric acid into the esophagus.<ref name = Blaser_2005 /> While some favorable evidence has been accumulated, [[as of 2005]] the theory is not universally accepted.

==Genome studies of different strains==
[[image:Helicobacter_pylori.jpg|thumb|EM photograph of ''H. pylori'']]
Several strains are known, and the [[genome]]s of two have been completely [[sequencing|sequenced]].<ref>The [http://genolist.pasteur.fr/PyloriGene/ Pylori Gene] website allows access to genome information for the ''H. pylori'' 26695 and J99 strains. Another genome interface is provided by the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=genome&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=Overview&list_uids=128 26695], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=genome&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=Overview&list_uids=139 J99].</ref> The genome of the strain "26695" consists of about 1.7 million base pairs, with some 1550 genes. The two sequenced strains show large genetic differences, with up to 6% of the nucleotides differing.

Study of the ''H. pylori'' genome is centered on attempts to understand [[pathogenesis]], the ability of this organism to cause disease. There are 62 genes in the "pathogenesis" category of the genome database. Both sequenced strains have an approximately 40 kb long Cag [[pathogenicity island]] (a common gene sequence believed responsible for pathogenesis) that contains over 40 genes. This pathogenicity island is usually absent from ''H. pylori'' strains isolated from humans who are carriers of ''H. pylori'' but remain asymptomatic. 

The cagA gene codes for one of the major ''H. pylori'' [[virulence]] proteins. Bacterial strains that have the cagA gene are associated with an ability to cause severe ulcers. The cagA gene codes for a relatively long (1186 [[amino acid]]) protein. The cagA protein is transported into human cells where it may disrupt the normal functioning of the [[cytoskeleton]]. The Cag pathogenicity island has about 30 genes that code for a complex [[type IV secretion system]]. After attachment of ''H.pylori'' to stomach epithelial cells, the cagA protein is injected into the epithelial cells by the type IV secretion system. The cagA protein is [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] on [[Protein kinase#Tyrosine-specific protein kinases|tyrosine residues]] by a host cell membrane-associated [[tyrosine kinase]]. Pathogenic strains of ''H. pylori'' have been shown to activate the [[epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR), a membrane protein with a tyrosine kinase domain. Activation of the EGFR by ''H. pylori'' is associated with altered [[signal transduction]] and [[gene expression]] in host epithelial cells that may contribute to pathogenesis. It has also been suggested that a [[C-terminus|c-terminal]] region of the cagA protein (amino acids 873–1002) can regulate host cell gene transcription independent of protein tyrosine phosphorylation.  It is thought, due to cagA's low GC content relative to the rest of the helicobacter genome, that the gene was acquired by horizontal transfer from another cagA+ bacterial species.

Each human population has a characteristic distribution of ''H. pylori'' strains that typically infect members of that population. This allows researchers to use ''H. pylori'' to study human migration patterns. It could be established that ''H. pylori'' in [[Indigenous people of Brazil|Amazon Indians]] has East Asian rather than European origins, suggesting that it arrived with the original immigrants at least 11,000 years ago.
