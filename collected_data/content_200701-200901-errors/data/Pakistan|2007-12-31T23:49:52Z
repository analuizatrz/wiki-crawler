The '''[[Islamic republic|Islamic Republic]] of Pakistan''' ({{lang-ur|اسلامی جمہوریۂ پاکستان}}), or {{Audio|Pakistan_pronunciation.ogg|'''Pakistan'''}}, is a country in [[South Asia]], marking the region where South Asia converges with [[Central Asia]] and the [[Middle East]].<ref> [http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761560851/Pakistan.html Encarta Encyclopedia - Pakistan] </ref><ref name="Middle East Institute">[http://www.mideasti.org/countries/countries.php?name=pakistan Middle East Institute: Pakistan]</ref> It has a 1,046 kilometer (650 mile) coastline along the [[Arabian Sea]] in the south, and is bordered by [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iran]] in the west, [[India]] in the east and [[People's Republic of China|China]] in the far northeast.<ref name="Kashmir status">The [[Kashmir]] region is claimed by [[India]] and Pakistan. Both countries and [[China]] separately administer parts of the region with the Indian and Pakistani-held areas defined by the [[Line of Control]]. The Pakistani-Chinese border is not recognized by India. India refers to [[Azad Kashmir]] and the [[Northern Areas]] as [[Pakistan Occupied Kashmir]] (POK)</ref>

Pakistan is the [[List of countries by population|sixth most populous country]] in the world. It also has [[Islam by country|the second largest Muslim population in the world]]. Its territory was a part of the [[partition of India|pre-partitioned]] [[British Raj|British India]] and has a long history of settlement and civilisation including the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]]. The region has been invaded by the [[Greeks]], [[Persians]], [[Arabs]], [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan]]s, [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], and [[Mongols]]. The territory was incorporated into British India in the nineteenth century. Since its independence, the country has been characterized by periods of military and economic growth interspersed with political instability.

The nation was founded officially as the ''Dominion of Pakistan'' in 1947, under the leadership of [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]] and the [[Muslim League]], and was renamed the ''Islamic Republic'' of Pakistan in 1956. Pakistan was a founding member of the [[OIC]], [[SAARC]], [[D8]] and [[ECO]]. It is also a member of the [[UN]], [[WTO]], [[G33]], [[G77]] and is a [[nuclear power]].

==Etymology==
The name "Pakistan" ({{IPA2|paːkɪst̪aːn}}) means "[[-stan|Land of]] (the) [[Paak|Pure]]" in [[Urdu]], and [[Persian language|Persian]]. It was coined in 1934 as "Pakstan" by [[Choudhary Rahmat Ali]], who published it in his pamphlet ''[[Now or Never; Are We to Live or Perish Forever?|Now or Never]]''.<ref name="pamphlet">[http://www.zyworld.com/slam33/non.htm Text of the ''Now or Never pamphlet'', issued on [[January 28]], [[1933]]]</ref> The name represented the "thirty million Muslims of PAKSTAN, who live in the five Northern Units of (British) India&mdash;[[Punjab (Pakistan)|'''P'''unjab]], [[North-West Frontier Province|'''A'''fghania (North-West Frontier Province)]], [[Kashmir|'''K'''ashmir]], [[Sindh|'''S'''indh]], and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Baluchis'''TAN''']]."<ref>Wolpert, Stanley. 1984.

==History==
<!-- THIS SECTION IS A SUMMARY. CONSIDER ADDING MATERIAL TO THE 'HISTORY OF PAKISTAN' ARTICLE.-->
{{Main|History of Pakistan}}
The [[Indus River|Indus region]] which covers much of Pakistan, was the site of several ancient cultures including the Neolithic era [[Mehrgarh]], and the Bronze era [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (2500 BCE - 1500 BCE) at [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-Daro]].<ref name="indus_valley">[http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/middle_east/mohenjo_daro.html Minnesota State University page on Mohenjo-Daro]</ref>

Waves of conquerors and migrants including [[Harappan]], [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]], [[Persian empire|Persian]], [[Greece|Grecian]], [[Saka]], [[Parthian]], [[Kushan]], [[White Hun]], [[Demography of Afghanistan|Afghan]], [[Arab]], [[Turkic peoples|Turkics]], and [[Mughal]] settled in the region throughout the centuries, influencing the locals and being absorbed among them. However, while the eastern provinces of Punjab and Sind became aligned with [[Islam in India|Indo-Islamic civilization]], the western areas became culturally allied with the [[Iranian peoples|Iranic civilization]] of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iran]]. The modern state of Pakistan was established on [[14 August]] [[1947]]. The region is a crossroads of historic trade routes, including the [[Silk Road]]. 

The [[Indus Valley Civilization]] collapsed in the middle of the second millennium BCE and was followed by the [[Vedic Civilization]], which extended over much of the Indo-Gangetic plains. Successive empires and kingdoms ruled the region from the [[Achaemenid]] Persian empire<ref name="achaemenid">[http://www.livius.org/aa-ac/achaemenians/achaemenians.html Livius.org on the extent of the Achaemenid Empire]</ref> around 543 BCE, to [[Alexander the Great]]<ref name="plutarch">[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/8.html#ref98 Plutarch's ''Life of Alexander'']</ref> in 326 BCE and the [[Mauryan]] empire. The [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] founded by [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius of Bactria]] included [[Gandhara]] and [[Punjab region|Punjab]] from 184 BCE, and reached its greatest extent under [[Menander I|Menander]], establishing the [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist]] period with advances in trade and culture. The city of [[Taxila]] (Takshashila) became a major centre of learning in ancient times - the remains of the city, located to the west of [[Islamabad]], are one of the country's major [[archaeological site]]s.

[[Image:SepoyMutiny.jpg|thumb|The 1857 War of Independence]]

In 712 [[Common Era|CE]], the Arab general [[Muhammad bin Qasim]]<ref name="qasim">[http://www.infinityfoundation.com/ECITChachnamaframeset.htm Infinity Foundation's translation of the Chach-Nama]</ref> conquered [[Sindh]] and [[Multan]] in southern [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]. The Pakistan government's official chronology states that "its foundation was laid" as a result of this invasion.<ref name="Information of Pakistan"> {{cite web | title= History in Chronological Order | publisher= Government of Pakistan |url=http://www.infopak.gov.pk/History.aspx}}</ref> This would set the stage for several successive Muslim empires in the [[Indian subcontinent]], including the [[Ghaznavid Empire]], the [[Muhammad of Ghor|Ghorid]] Kingdom, the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and the [[Mughal Empire]]. During this period, [[Sufi]] missionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional Buddhist and Hindu population to [[Islam]]. The gradual decline of the Mughal Empire in the early eighteenth century provided opportunities for the [[Durrani Empire|Afghans]], [[Balochis]] and [[Sikhs]] to exercise control over large areas until the [[British East India Company]]<ref name="east_india">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/pktoc.html Library of Congress study of Pakistan]</ref> gained ascendancy over South Asia. 

[[Image:GGJinnah.jpg|thumb|left|[[Governor General]] [[Jinnah]] delivering the opening address on [[11 August]] [[1947]] to the new state of Pakistan.]]

The [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion]], also known as the Indian Mutiny, in 1857 was the region's last major armed struggle against the British Raj, and it laid the foundations for the generally unarmed freedom struggle led by the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]]. However, the [[All India Muslim League|Muslim League]] rose to popularity in the late 1930s amid fears of under-representation and neglect of Muslims in politics. On [[29 December]] [[1930]], [[Allama Iqbal]]'s presidential address called for an autonomous "state in northwestern India for Indian Muslims, within the body politic of India."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00islamlinks/txt_iqbal_1930.html| title=Sir Muhammad Iqbal's 1930 Presidential Address| work=Speeches, Writings, and Statements of Iqbal| accessdate=2006-12-19}}</ref> [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] espoused the ''[[Two Nation Theory]]'' and led the Muslim League to adopt the ''[[Lahore Resolution]]''<ref name="resolution">[http://www.jang.com.pk/thenews/spedition/23%20march%202005/index.htm#d Jang.com page on the Lahore Resolution]</ref> of 1940 (popularly known as the [[Pakistan Resolution]]), which ultimately led to the formation of an independent Pakistan.

Pakistan was formed on [[14 August]] [[1947]] with two Muslim-majority wings in the eastern and northwestern regions of the [[British Raj|British Indian Empire]], separated from the rest of the country with a Hindu majority, and comprising the provinces of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], [[East Bengal]], the [[North-West Frontier Province]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|West Punjab]] and [[Sindh]]. The [[Partition of India|partition of the British Indian Empire]] resulted in communal riots<ref name="1947riots">[http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat3.htm#India Estimates for the 1947 death toll]</ref> across India and Pakistan&mdash;millions of Muslims moved to Pakistan and millions of Hindus and [[Sikhs]] moved to India. Disputes arose over several [[princely state]]s including [[Jammu and Kashmir]] whose ruler had acceded to India following an invasion by Pashtun warriors, leading to the [[First Kashmir War]] (1948) ending with India occupying roughly two-third of the state. From 1947 to 1956, Pakistan was a [[Dominion]] in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The republic declared in 1956 was stalled by a [[coup d'etat]] by [[Ayub Khan]] (1958&ndash;69), who was president during a period of internal instability and a [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|second war]] with India in 1965. His successor, [[Yahya Khan]] (1969&ndash;71) had to deal with the [[1970 Bhola cyclone|cyclone]] which caused 500,000 deaths<ref name="cyclone">[http://nirapad.org/care_nirapad/Home/Magazine/chronology/currentissue/html/news8.html "Community participation in disaster management can reduce the losses"]</ref> in East Pakistan. 

Economic and political dissent in [[East Pakistan]] led to violent political repression and tensions escalating into [[civil war]]<ref name="1971war">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/south_asia/2002/india_pakistan/timeline/1971.stm 1971 war summary by BBC website]</ref> ([[Bangladesh War of Independence]]) (see also [[Causes of Separation of East Pakistan]]) and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]] and ultimately the secession of East Pakistan as the independent state of [[Bangladesh]].<ref name="Bangladesh">http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/17.htm US Country Studies article on the Bangladesh War]</ref>. Estimates of the number of people killed during this episode vary greatly, from ~30,000 to over 2 million depending on the source. 

[[Image:PAK1971.JPG|thumb|The two wings of Pakistan in 1970; [[East Pakistan]] separated from the West wing in 1971 as an independent [[Bangladesh]].]]

Civilian rule resumed from 1972 to 1977 under [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], until he was deposed and later sentenced to death in what amounted to a judicial murder in 1979 by General [[Zia-ul-Haq]], who became the country's third military president. Pakistan's [[secular]] policies were replaced by Zia's introduction of the Islamic [[Shariat|Shariah]] legal code, which increased religious influences on the civil service and the military. With the death of General Zia in a plane crash in 1988, [[Benazir Bhutto]], daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was elected as the first female Prime Minister of Pakistan. Over the next decade, she alternated power with [[Nawaz Sharif]], as the country's political and economic situation worsened. Pakistan sent 5,000 troops to the 1991 [[Gulf War]] as part of a US led coalition and specifically for the defence of [[Saudi Arabia]].<ref name="gulf_war">[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/09/24/MN168392.DTL The 1991 Gulf war]</ref> Military tensions in the [[Kargil War|Kargil conflict]]<ref name="kargil">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/352995.stm Kargil conflict timeline on the BBC website]</ref> with India were followed by a [[1999 Pakistani coup d'état|Pakistani military coup d'état in 1999]]<ref name="1999coup">[http://www.news.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1999/10/13/wcoo13.html Daily Telegraph (UK) article on the 1999 coup]</ref> in which General [[Pervez Musharraf]] assumed executive powers. In 2001, Musharraf named himself [[President of Pakistan|President]] after the forced resignation of [[Rafiq Tarar]]. After the 2002 parliamentary elections, Musharraf transferred executive powers to newly elected Prime Minister [[Zafarullah Khan Jamali]], who was succeeded in the 2004 Prime-Ministerial election by [[Shaukat Aziz]], followed by a temporary period in office by [[Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain]]. On 15th November, 2007 the National Assembly completed its tenure and so a caretaker government was appointed with the former Chairman of the Senate, [[Muhammad Mian Soomro]] as caretaker Prime Minister. However, the [[December 2007]] assassination of Benazir Bhutto underscores the instability of Pakistan's political system.

==Government and politics==
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
{{main|Government of Pakistan|Politics of Pakistan}}
[[Image:ParliamentHouse.jpg|thumb|Parliament house in [[Islamabad]]]]
The [[Muslim League]] formed Pakistan's first [[government]] under the leadership of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] and [[Liaquat Ali Khan]]. The Muslim League's leadership of Pakistani politics decreased significantly with the rise of other political parties, including the [[Pakistan People's Party]] in West Pakistan, and the [[Awami League]] in East Pakistan, which would ultimately led to the creation of Bangladesh. The first [[Constitution of Pakistan]] was adopted in 1956, but was suspended in 1958 by [[Ayub Khan]]. The Constitution of 1973, suspended in 1977 by [[Zia-ul-Haq]], was re-instated in 1991 and is the country's most important document, laying the foundations of government. Pakistan is a [[Federal republic|federal]] [[democratic republic]] with [[Islam]] as the state religion. The [[semi-presidential system]] includes a [[bicameral]] legislature consisting of a 100-member [[Senate of Pakistan|Senate]] and a 342-member [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]]. The [[President of Pakistan|President]] is the [[Head of State]] and the [[Commander in Chief]] of the Armed Forces and is elected by an [[Electoral College of Pakistan|electoral college]]. The [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|prime minister]] is usually the leader of the largest party in the National Assembly. Each province has a similar system of government with a directly elected Provincial Assembly in which the leader of the largest party or alliance becomes Chief Minister. Provincial Governors are appointed by the President. 
[[Image:Prime Minister Secretariat Building.jpg|thumb|Prime Minister's Secretariat in [[Islamabad]]]]
The [[Military of Pakistan|Pakistani military]] has played an influential role in mainstream [[Politics of Pakistan|politics]] throughout Pakistan's history, with military presidents ruling from 1958&ndash;71, 1977&ndash;88 and from 1999 onwards. The leftist Pakistan People's Party (PPP), led by [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], emerged as a major political player during the 1970s. Under the military rule of [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], Pakistan began a marked shift from the British-era secular politics and policies, to the adoption of [[Shariat]] and other laws based on Islam. During the 1980s, the anti-[[feudal]], pro-[[Muhajir Urdu|Muhajir]] [[Muttahida Qaumi Movement]] (MQM) was started by unorthodox and educated urban dwellers of [[Sindh]] and particularly [[Karachi]]. The 1990s were characterized by coalition politics dominated by the PPP and a rejuvenated Muslim League. 

In the October 2002 general elections, the [[Pakistan Muslim League (Q)]] (PML-Q) won a [[plurality]] of National Assembly seats with the second-largest group being the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|Pakistan People's Party Parliamentarians]] (PPPP), a sub-party of the PPP. [[Zafarullah Khan Jamali]] of PML-Q emerged as Prime Minister but resigned on [[26 June]] [[2004]] and was replaced by PML-Q leader [[Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain]] as interim Prime Minister. On [[28 August]], [[2004]] the National Assembly voted 191 to 151 to elect the [[Finance Minister of Pakistan|Finance Minister]] and former [[Citibank]] Vice President [[Shaukat Aziz]] as Prime Minister. [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal]], a coalition of Islamic religious parties, won elections in [[North-West Frontier Province]], and increased their representation in the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]].

[[Image:BUSHPERVEZ.jpg|thumb|US President [[George W. Bush]] and [[Pervez Musharraf|President Musharraf]] in late 2006.]]
Pakistan is an active member of the [[United Nations]] (UN) and the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC), the latter of which Pakistan has used as a forum for ''Enlightened Moderation'',<ref name="enlightened_moderation>[http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/EnlightenedModeration.aspx President Musharraf on Enlightened Moderation]</ref> a plan to promote a [[renaissance]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] in the Muslim world. Pakistan is also a member of the major regional organisations of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) and the [[Economic Cooperation Organisation]] (ECO). In the past, Pakistan has had mixed relations with the United States especially in the early 1950s when Pakistan was the United States' "most allied ally in Asia"<ref name="mostallied">[http://www.fpa.org/newsletter_info2583/newsletter_info_sub_list.htm?section=Pakistan%3A%20The%20Most%20Allied%20Ally%20in%20Asia Pakistan: The Most Allied Ally in Asia]</ref> and a member of both the [[Central Treaty Organisation]] (CENTO) and the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation]] (SEATO). During the [[Soviet-Afghan War]] in the 1980s Pakistan was a crucial US ally, but relations soured in the 1990s, when sanctions were applied by the US over suspicions of Pakistan's nuclear activities. The [[September 11 attacks]] and the subsequent [[War on Terrorism]] have seen an improvement in US&ndash;Pakistan ties, especially after Pakistan ended its support of the [[Taliban]] regime in [[Kabul]]. This was evidenced by a drastic increase in American military aid, which saw Pakistan take in $4 billion more in three years after the 9/11 attacks than in the three years before.<ref>

Pakistan has long had troubled relations with [[Relations between India and Pakistan|neighbouring India]]. The long-running dispute over [[Kashmir]] resulted in full-fledged wars in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]] and [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]]. Civil war in 1971 flared into the simultaneous [[Bangladesh War of Independence]] and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. Pakistan conducted [[Nuclear testing|nuclear weapon tests]] in 1998 to counterbalance India's nuclear explosion ([[Smiling Buddha]]) of 1974 and [[Pokhran-II]] of 1998 respectively and became the only Muslim [[declared nuclear states|nuclear weapons state]].<ref>[http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=M1ARTM0011704 The Canadian Encyclopedia Historica, India's Nuclear Test] Maclean's Magazine, William Lowther, Nomi Morris, and Sankarshan Thakur, 25 May 1998</ref> The relations with India are steadily improving following peace initiatives in 2002. Pakistan maintains close [[economic]], [[military]] and [[political]] relationships with the [[People's Republic of China]]. 

Pakistan also faces instability in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]], where some tribal leaders support the [[Taliban]]. Pakistan has had to deploy the army in these regions to suppress the local unrest, in [[Waziristan]]. The [[Waziristan conflict]] ended with a recently declared [[Waziristan Accord|peace agreement]] between the tribal leaders and the Pakistani government that is expected to bring back stability to the region.<ref name="local_unrest">[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2005%5C12%5C31%5Cstory_31-12-2005_pg7_29 'Taliban' gain sway in tribal region]. <u>Daily Times</u>. [[31 December]] [[2005]].</ref>

Additionally, the [[country]] has long faced instability in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]],its largest [[province]]  by size, but smallest by population. The army was deployed to fight a serious [[insurgency]] within the province from 1973&ndash;76. Social stability resumed after [[Rahimuddin Khan]] was appointed [[martial law administrator]] beginning in 1977. After relative peace throughout the 1980s and 1990s, some influential Baloch tribal leaders restarted a separatist movement after Pervez Musharraf took over in 1999. In a recent incident [[Nawab Akbar Bugti]], the leader of the [[Baloch]] insurgency, was killed in August 2006 by Pakistani military forces.

On [[November 3]] [[2007]] President Musharraf declared an [[2007 Pakistani state of emergency|emergency rule]] across Pakistan and purported to suspend the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]], imposing [[martial law]]. In [[Islamabad]], troops apparently entered the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]] and were surrounding the judges' homes and opposition leaders like [[Benazir Bhutto]], Imran Khan were put on house arrest. Justice [[Abdul Hameed Dogar]] has been appointed as the new chief justice of Pakistan, due to the refusal of the [[Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry]] to endorse the emergency order, declaring it unconstitutional, though he himself took oath under PCO in 1999.<ref name="bbcemergency">{{citeweb| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7076670.stm| title=Musharraf imposes emergency rule| work=[[BBC News]]| date=[[November 3]] [[2007]]| accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> In response, Pakistan was suspended from the councils of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] on [[22 November]] [[2007]].<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Pakistan barred from Commonwealth | date=22 November 2007 | publisher=BBC | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7108543.stm | work =BBC News website | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-23 | language = }}</ref>

In recent years, militant Islamists in the [[Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi]] (TNSM) organization, led by radical cleric [[Maulana Fazlullah]] have rebelled against the Pakistani government in [[Swat (Pakistan)|Swat]] in the [[North-West Frontier Province, Pakistan|North-West Frontier Province]]. In 59 villages, the militants had set up a "parallel government" with Islamic courts imposing [[sharia]] law. After a four-month truce ended in late September, 2007, fighting resumed.<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&sid=akTcKrCtbmWE&refer=uk], Qayum, Khalid and Ahmed, Khaleeq, "Pakistan Deploys Troops in Swat to Curb Militants (Update 1)", Bloomberg News, [[October 25]], [[2007]], article references ''Dawn'' newspaper in Pakistan, "citing Badshah Gul, home secretary of the province"; accessed [[November 7]], [[2007]]</ref> The paramilitary Frontier Constabulary had been deployed to the area to quell the violence, but seemed ineffective.

==Administrative divisions==

[[Image:Sub Pakistan.png|thumb|Provinces and territories of Pakistan]]
Pakistan is a [[federation]]<ref name="federation">[http://www.nrb.gov.pk/constitutional_and_legal/constitution/part1.notes.html#1 The Constitutional basis of the Federation of Pakistan]</ref> of four provinces, a capital territory and federally administered tribal areas. Pakistan exercises ''de facto'' jurisdiction over the western parts of the [[Kashmir]] region, organised as two separate political entities ([[Azad Kashmir]] and [[Northern Areas]]), which are also claimed by India. Pakistan also claims [[Jammu and Kashmir]], which is a portion of Kashmir that is administered by India.

In 2001 the federal government abolished the administrative entities called "[[Divisions of Pakistan|Divisions]]", which used to be the third tier of government. The entities called "[[Districts of Pakistan|districts]]" (''zillas''), which used to be the fourth tier, became the new third tier. The provinces and the capital territory are subdivided into a total of [[Districts of Pakistan|107 districts]] which contain numerous [[tehsil]]s and local governments. The tribal areas comprise seven tribal agencies and six small frontier regions detached from neighbouring districts whilst Azad Kashmir comprises seven districts and Northern Areas comprises six districts.

[[Image:K2 8611.jpg|thumb|left| [[K2]], at 8,611 metres (28,251 ft), is the second highest peak in the world.]]
Pakistan covers {{convert|340403|sqmi|sqkm|0}}<ref name="area_from_factbook"> [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pk.html The area of Pakistan proper excludes the regions administered in Kashmir] URL accessed on [[November 03]], [[2006]]</ref>, approximately the combined land areas of [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], with its eastern regions located on the [[Indian plate|Indian tectonic plate]] and the western and northern regions on the [[Iranian plateau]] and [[Eurasian landplate]].

The different types of natural features range from the sandy beaches, [[lagoon]]s, and [[mangrove]] swamps of the southern coast to preserved beautiful moist temperate forests and the icy peaks of the [[Himalaya]], [[Karakoram]] and [[Hindu Kush]] mountains in the north. There are an estimated 108 peaks above 7,000&nbsp;metres (23,000&nbsp;ft) high that are covered in snow and [[glaciers]]. Five of the mountains in Pakistan (including [[Nanga Parbat]]) are over 8,000&nbsp;metres (26,000&nbsp;ft). [[India]]n-controlled Kashmir to the [[Northern Areas|Northern Areas of Pakistan]] and running the length of the country is the [[Indus River]] with its many tributaries. The northern parts of Pakistan attract a large number of foreign tourists. To the west of the Indus are the dry, hilly deserts of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]; to the east are the rolling sand dunes of the [[Thar Desert]]. The [[Tharparkar]] desert in the southern province of Sindh, is the only fertile desert in the world. Most areas of Punjab and parts of Sindh are fertile plains where agriculture is of great importance.

The climate varies as much as the scenery, with cold winters and hot summers in the north and a mild climate in the south, moderated by the influence of the ocean. The central parts have extremely hot summers with temperatures rising to 45&nbsp;°C (113&nbsp;°F), followed by very cold winters, often falling below freezing. Officially the highest temperature recorded in Pakistan is {{convert|50.55|C|F|lk=on}} at Pad Idan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/scienceques2001/20020524.htm |title=Science Question of the Week |accessdate=2007-12-31 |author=Goddard Space Flight Center |authorlink=Goddard Space Flight Center |date=2002-05-24 |publisher=NASA]]}}</ref> There is very little rainfall ranging from less than 250 millimetres to more than 1,250 millimetres (9.8&ndash;49.2 in), mostly brought by the unreliable south-westerly [[monsoon]] winds during the late summer. The construction of dams on the rivers and the drilling of water wells in many drier areas have temporarily eased water shortages at the expense of downgradient populations.

==Flora and fauna==
[[Image:Hunzavalleyriver.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]] valley in northern Pakistan. &mdash; Agricultural and scenic]]
The wide variety of landscapes and climates in Pakistan allows for a wide variety of wild animals and birds. The forests range from [[coniferous]] [[alpine]] and [[subalpine]] trees such as spruce, pine, and [[deodar cedar]] in the northern mountains to [[deciduous]] trees such as the mulberry-type Shisham in the [[Sulaiman Mountains|Sulaiman range]] in the south. The western hills have [[juniper]] and [[tamarisk]] as well as coarse grasses and scrub plants. Along the coast are [[mangrove]] forests which form much of the coastal wetlands.

In the south, there are crocodiles in the murky waters at the mouth of the Indus River whilst on the banks of the river, there are boars, deer, [[porcupine]]s, and small rodents. In the sandy scrublands of central Pakistan are found jackals, hyenas, wild cats, panthers, and leopards while the clear blue skies abound with hawks, falcons, and eagles. In the southwestern deserts are rare Asiatic cheetahs. In the northern mountains are a variety of endangered animals including [[Marco Polo sheep]], [[Urial|Urial sheep]], [[Markhor]] and [[Ibex]] goats, [[Asiatic black bear|black]] and [[Brown bear|brown]] Himalayan bears, and the rare [[Snow Leopard]]. During August 2006, Pakistan donated an orphaned snow leopard cub called Leo to USA.<ref name="Pakistan donates snow leopard to USA">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4776031.stm Leo the snow leopard is US-bound]</ref> Another rare species is the blind [[Indus River Dolphin]] of which there are believed to be about 1,000 remaining, protected in two major sanctuaries. In recent years the number of wild animals being killed for fur and leather trading led to a new law banning the hunting of wild animals and birds and the establishment of several wildlife sanctuaries and game reserves.<ref name="wildlife">[http://www.wildlifeofpakistan.com/wildlifesanctuarygamereservesmap.htm Wildlife Sanctuaries of Pakistan]</ref>

Pakistan is a [[developing country]] which has faced a number of challenges on both political and economic fronts. Despite being a very poor country in 1947, Pakistan's economic growth rate was better than the global average during the subsequent four decades, but imprudent policies led to a slowdown in the late 1990s.<ref name="econ_1990s">{{cite web| url=http://www.pakistanstudies-aips.org/en/economy.htm| title=Pakistan Studies; Economy| accessdate=2006-11-20| work=American Institute of Pakistan Studies}}</ref> Recently, wide-ranging economic reforms have resulted in a stronger economic outlook and accelerated growth especially in the [[manufacturing]] and [[financial services]] [[List of recognized economic sectors|sector]]s. There has been great improvement in the [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] position and rapid growth in [[hard currency]] reserves in recent years. The 2005 estimate of foreign debt was close to US$40 billion. However, this has decreased in recent years with assistance from the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and significant debt-relief from the United States. Pakistan's [[gross domestic product]], as measured by [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP), is estimated to be US$475.4 billion <ref name="imfPPP">{{cite web| url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2007/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2007&ey=2007&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=564&s=PPPGDP%2CPPPPC&grp=0&a=&pr.x=59&pr.y=1| title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects (PPP)| accessdate=2006-11-20| work=International Monetary Fund}}</ref> while its [[per capita income]] (PCI) stands at $2,976.<ref>[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcoutm.cfm?SD=2007&ED=2007&R1=1&R2=1&CS=3&SS=2&OS=C&DD=0&OUT=1&C=564&S=PPPPC&CMP=0&x=89&y=14 Report for Selected Countries and Subjects].

The growth of non-agricultural sectors has changed the structure of the economy, and agriculture now only accounts for roughly 20% of the GDP. The [[Service Sector|service]] sector accounts for 53% of the country's GDP with [[wholesale]] and [[retail]] trade forming 30% of this sector. In recent times, the [[Karachi Stock Exchange]] has soared, along with most of the world's [[emerging markets]]. Large amounts of foreign investments have been made into several industries. The top industries in Pakistan are [[telecom]], [[software]], [[automotives]], [[textiles]], [[cement]], [[fertilizer]], [[steel]], [[ship building]], and more recently, [[Pakistan Aeronautical Complex      |Aerospace]].

Pakistan has accomplished many engineering feats such as construction of the world's largest earth filled dam [[Tarbela Dam|Tarbela]], the world's twelfth largest dam [[Mangla Dam|Mangla]], as well as, with collaboration with [[China]], the world's highest international road: the [[Karakoram Highway]].

In November of 2006 [[People's Republic of China|China]] and Pakistan signed a [[Free Trade Agreement]] hoping to triple bilateral trade from $4.2 billion ([[USD]]) to $15 billion ([[USD]]) within the next five years;<ref name="fta">[http://english.people.com.cn/200611/27/eng20061127_325492.html Experts: Enhance economic links]</ref>
Pakistan's annual exports in 2005 amounted to $15 billion ([[USD]]),<ref name="expor">[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2078rank.html CIA Factbook]</ref> and is poised to cross $18 billion ([[USD]]) in 2006 and $20 billion ([[USD]]) in 2007.<ref>[http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/PRPressReleaseDetail.aspx?nPRPressReleaseId=1856&nYear=2006&nMonth=7 Pakistan hopes to achieve $18 bln exports this year]</ref> Pakistan is also home to a thriving [[arms industry]] which exports $200 million ([[USD]]) annually, mostly defence equipment and arms to countries in the Middle East and South Asia, and its defence officials are hopeful that these exports will surpass $500 million ([[USD]]) a year within the next five years. 

In keeping with its rapid economic development in recent years, Pakistan registered an economic growth rate of 7 percent in the financial year 2006–07, the fourth consecutive year of seven percent growth.<ref>[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006\12\01\story_1-12-2006_pg5_4 7% growth achieved in FY 05–06]</ref><ref>[http://www.pakistantimes.net/2007/06/02/business1.htm Pakistan Economy Registers 7% Growth Rate for 4th Consecutive Year]</ref> In its June 2006 Economic Survey global finance giant [[Morgan Stanley]] listed Pakistan on its list of major [[emerging markets]] in the world economy, placing it on a list of 25 countries displaying continued moderate to strong growth over a sustained period of time.<ref>[http://www.msci.com/equity/indexdesc.html MSCI Index descriptions]</ref> The report noted "its economy has been growing quickly in recent periods and corporate direct investors have taken notice".

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Pakistan}}
[[Image:Pakistan ethnic 1973.jpg|thumb|Major Ethnic Groups in Pakistan, 1973]]
Pakistan has an estimated population of 164,742,000 as of 2007.<ref name="US Census Bureau 1">{{cite web| url=http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/country/pkportal.html| title=Pakistan IDB Country Summary| work=International Data Base| author=U.S. Census Bureau| accessdate=2007-09-30}}</ref> Pakistan has the world's sixth largest [[population]], placing it higher than [[Russia]], and lower than [[Brazil]]. Pakistan is expected to surpass [[Brazil]] in population by the year [[2020]] because of the high growth rate. Population projections for Pakistan are relatively difficult because of the apparent differences in the accuracy of each census and the inconsistencies between various surveys related to the fertility rate, but it is likely that the rate of growth peaked in the 1980s and has since declined significantly.<ref name="population">[http://www.gfeeney.com/pubs/2003-pakistan-fertility-2/2003-pakistan-fertility-2.pdf Feeney and Alam, 2003]</ref> The population was estimated at 162,400,000<ref name="prb">[http://www.prb.org/pdf05/05WorldDataSheet_Eng.pdf Population Reference Bureau's 2005 World Data Sheet]</ref> on [[July 1]], [[2005]], with a fertility rate of 34 per thousand, a death rate of 10 per thousand, and the rate of natural increase at 2.4%. Pakistan also has a high infant mortality rate of 70 per thousand births.<ref name="US Census Bureau 2">[http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idbprint.html International Data Base] U.S. Census Bureau. URL accessed on [[17 October]] [[2006]].</ref>

The major ethnic groups are - [[Punjabis]] (44.68% of the population), [[Pashtuns]] (15.42%), [[Sindhis]] (14.1%), [[Seraikis]] (10.53%), [[Muhajir Urdu|Muhajir]]s (7.57%), [[Balochis]] (3.57%) and others (4.66%). As of November 2007, about 2 million registered [[Afghan refugees]] remain in Pakistan as a result of the ongoing war and instablity in [[Afghanistan]].<ref>Pajhwok Afghan News, [http://www.pajhwok.com/viewstory.asp?lng=eng&id=44975 ''UNHCR hails Pakistan as an important partner (Nov. 3, 2007)'']</ref> 

Primary mother tongue language usage largely corresponds to ethnic groups. Despite being a native language of a relatively small minority, [[Urdu]] is the [[Languages of Pakistan|national language]] and ''[[lingua franca]]'' of Pakistan, while [[English language|English]] is the [[official language]], used in the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]] and widely used by corporate businesses, the educated urban elite, and most universities. [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] is spoken by over 60 million people, but has no official recognition in the country.<ref name=Punjabi> [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=pnb Ethnologue Western Punjabi]</ref>

The demographics of religion in Pakistan were significantly influenced in 1947 by the movement of Muslims to Pakistan, and Hindus and Sikhs to India. Census data<ref name="census">[http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/statistics/other_tables/pop_by_religion.pdf Census results for religions of Pakistan]</ref> indicates that 96% of the population are [[Islam in Pakistan|Muslim]]s, (nearly 77% are [[Sunni Muslims]] and [[Shi'a population|20%]] are [[Shi'a Muslims]] according to CIA estimates<ref name="estimate"> [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pk.html Estimate from CIA World Factbook] </ref>). Minority religions include [[Hinduism in Pakistan|Hinduism]] (1.85%), [[Christianity in Pakistan|Christianity]] (1.6%), as well as much smaller numbers of [[Sikhism in Pakistan|Sikh]]s (Around 0.04%), [[Parsi]]s, [[Ahmadi]]s, [[Buddhist]]s, [[History of the Jews in Pakistan|Jew]]s, and [[Animist]]s (mainly the [[Kalasha of Chitral]]). Pakistan is the second most populous [[Islam by country#Top sixty|Muslim-majority country]]<ref name="ayres">Robert Ayres, Turning Point: The End of the Growth Paradigm, James & James/Earthscan, 1998, pp. 63. ISBN 1853834394</ref> and also has the second largest [[Shi'a population]] in the world.

==Society and culture==
{{main|Culture of Pakistan}}
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:SalwarKamees.jpg|thumb|Shalwar Kameez, the traditional dress of Pakistan]] -->
[[Image:Faisal masjid isla galleryfull.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Shah Faisal Masjid]] in [[Islamabad]]. [[Islam]] has had an extensive impact on the culture of Pakistan.]]
Pakistan has a rich and unique culture that has preserved established traditions throughout history. Many cultural practices, foods, monuments, and shrines were inherited from the rule of Muslim [[Mughal]] and [[Afghan]] emperors. The national dress of [[shalwar qamiz]] is originally of [[Central Asian]] origin derived from [[Turko-Iranian]] nomadic invaders and is today worn in all parts of Pakistan. Women wear brightly coloured shalwar qamiz, while men often wear solid-coloured ones. In cities western dress is also popular among the youth and the business sector. 

The variety of [[Music of Pakistan|Pakistani music]] ranges from diverse provincial [[folk music]] and traditional styles such as [[Qawwali]] and [[Ghazal|Ghazal Gayaki]] to modern forms fusing traditional and western music, such as the synchronisation of Qawwali and western music by the world renowned [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]]. In addition Pakistan is home to many famous folk singers such as the late [[Alam Lohar]], who is also well known in [[Punjab (India)|Indian Punjab]]. The arrival of [[Afghan refugees]] in the western provinces has rekindled [[Pashto]] and [[Persians|Persian]] music and established [[Peshawar]] as a hub for Afghan musicians and a distribution centre for Afghan music abroad.

Until the 1990s, the state-owned [[Pakistan Television Corporation]] (PTV) and [[Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation]] were the dominant media outlets, but there are now numerous [[List of Pakistani TV and radio Channels|private television channels]]. Various American, European, and Asian television channels and movies are available to the majority of the Pakistani population via private Television Networks, [[cable TV|cable]], and [[satellite television]]. There are also small indigenous movie industries based in Lahore and Peshawar (often referred to as [[Lollywood]]). Although [[Bollywood]] movies are banned from being displayed in public cinemas since 1965,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4639216.stm Pakistan to show Bollywood film] Pakistan banned Indian movies following the [[Second Kashmir War|1965 war]] </ref> Indian film stars are still generally popular in Pakistan due to the fact that Pakistanis are easily able to buy Bollywood movies from local shops for private home viewing.

Pakistani society is largely [[multilingual]] and predominantly [[Muslim]], with high regard for traditional family values, although urban families have grown into a [[nuclear family]] system due to the socio-economic constraints imposed by the traditional [[joint family]] system. Recent decades have seen the emergence of a middle class in cities like [[Karachi]], [[Lahore]], [[Rawalpindi]], [[Hyderabad, Pakistan|Hyderabad]], [[Faisalabad]], and [[Peshawar]] that wish to move in a more liberal direction,<ref name="secular_middle">Beinart, Peter.
