'''Pamela Susan Courson''' ([[December 22]], [[1946]]-[[April 25]], [[1974]]) was best known as the long-term companion of late [[The Doors|Doors]]' vocalist [[Jim Morrison]].  After the deaths of Morrison and Courson, her parents got an out of state court to declare that the couple had what qualified as a common law marriage, despite the fact that it was an open relationship, and that Morrison's will described him as "an unmarried person."

==Biography==

===Early life===

===Morrison===
Courson first met Jim Morrison in Los Angeles around [[1966]] when the Doors were beginning their public career; where exactly they first met is still a matter of historical debate. In his 1998 [[memoir]] ''Light My Fire: My Life with the Doors'', former keyboardist [[Ray Manzarek]] stated that Courson and a friend saw the band during their stint at the London Fog, a lesser-known nightclub along the [[Sunset Strip]], and that she was initially courted by drummer [[John Densmore]].

===Deaths of Morrison and Courson===
On [[July 3]], [[1971]] James Douglas Morrison was found dead by Courson, in the bathtub of an apartment they were sharing in Paris. He was twenty-seven years of age. The official coroner's report listed his cause of death as heart failure. However, despite Morrison being young and of apparent good health, and the presence of blood in the water, no autopsy was performed, and questions persist over the actual cause of death. Per the stipulation in his will, which stated that he was "an unmarried person", Courson inherited his entire fortune, yet lawsuits against the estate would tie up her quest for inheritance for the next three years. 

On [[April 25]], [[1974]], Pamela Susan Courson died of a [[heroin]] [[overdose]] at the apartment she shared with two male friends. She was twenty-seven, the same age at which Jim Morrison died. The Courson family buried her under the name "Pamela Susan Morrison". After her death, her parents Columbus and Penny inherited Morrison's entire fortune, but their executorship of the estate was later contested by Morrison's parents, George and Clara Morrison.

After Pamela received her share of Morrison's Doors money, she never reached contact with the remaining Doors members.
