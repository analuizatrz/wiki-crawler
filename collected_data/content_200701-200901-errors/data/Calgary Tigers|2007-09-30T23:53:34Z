The '''Calgary Tigers''' were an [[ice hockey]] team based in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]] from 1919 until 1927, and 1932 until 1936.  They played their games at the [[Victoria Arena]].  

Created ostensively as an amateur team in hopes of competing for the [[Allan Cup]], the Tigers helped form the [[Western Canada Hockey League]] in 1921 to become the first major professional team in Calgary.  In 1924, after wining both the league and Western Canadian championships, the Tigers became the first Calgary based club to compete for the [[Stanley Cup]].  

After succumbing to financial pressures in 1927, the Tigers were briefly revived in the mid 1930s as a minor professional club.  The Tigers competed a total of twelve seasons in four leagues, winning four championships during their existence. 

==History==
===Big Four League===
The Tigers, along with the Calgary Canadians, [[Edmonton Eskimos (hockey)|Edmonton Eskimos]] and Edmonton Dominions formed the Big Four League in 1919.  Billing itself as an amateur circuit in hopes of competing for the [[Allan Cup]], it was a notorious example of what was known as a "shamateur league", as amateur teams secretly employed pros in an attempt to gain an upper hand on their competition.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sandor|2005|p=21}}</ref>  

The Big Four League died in a storm of controversy after only its second season. Having already lost its amateur status prior to the 1920-21 campaign, the league faced repeated accusations by teams against their opponent's star players, accusing them of being pros.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cole|2006|p=299}}</ref> An accusation against the Eskimos' goaltender, [[Bill Tobin (ice hockey)|Bill Tobin]], eventually led to the league formally canceling the championship.  The Tigers and Eskimos, however, agreed to play their own playoff, known as the ''Intercity Championship''.  The Tigers defeated the Eskimos in a two-game, total goal series, but the Big Four League was finished.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sandor|2005|p=25}}</ref>

===Western Canada Hockey League===
Following the demise of the Big Four, the Tigers joined the Eskimos in forming a new professional league in 1921 that intended to compete against the [[National Hockey League]] and [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]].  In the [[Western Canada Hockey League]], the Tigers were a consistent powerhouse, featuring a lineup that many considered a match to that of their NHL and PCHA rivals.  The Tigers lineup featured five future [[Hockey Hall of Fame|Hockey Hall of Famers]]: [[Barney Stanley]], [[Red Dutton]], [[Rusty Crawford]], [[Herb Gardiner]] and [[Harry Oliver (ice hockey)|Harry Oliver]].<ref name="EOH">{{cite web |url=http://www.oilersheritage.com/history/early_teams_calgary_tigers.html |title=Calgary Tigersâ€”A Team Of Legends |accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref>

In [[1923-24 WCHL season|1923-24]], the Tigers finished atop the league standings with 37 points.  They met the [[Regina Capitals]] in the league championship in a two-game, total goals series.  After battling Regina to a 2-2 draw in the [[Saskatchewan]] capital, the Tigers returned home to Calgary, capturing the championship on home ice in a 2-0 victory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sandor|2005|p=32}}</ref>  They then moved on to face the [[Vancouver Maroons]] of the PCHA in the best-of-three Western Canadian final.  After dropping the first game in [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]], the Tigers came back to defeat the Maroons 6-3 at home, and again 3-1 at a neutral site game in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]].<ref name="sandor33">{{Harvnb|Sandor|2005|p=33}}</ref>  The victory earned the Tigers the right to play for the [[Stanley Cup]], the first such opportunity for a Calgary based club.<ref name="EOH" />

Despite defeating the Maroons, the PCHA champions were not eliminated, much to Calgary's surprise.  Rather, the Tigers earned a bye into the finals, while Vancouver met the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in the semi-final.<ref name="zeman30">{{Harvnb|Zeman|1986|p=30}}</ref>  The ''blue, blanc et rouge'' swept Vancouver in two games, setting the matchup for the [[1924 Stanley Cup Finals]] where the Canadiens easily handled the Tigers.<ref name="sandor33" />  In the first game, played at [[Mount Royal Arena]] in [[Montreal]], Canadiens rookie [[Howie Morenz]] recorded a [[hat trick]] as Montreal won 6-1.  Due to poor ice conditions, the second game was moved to the [[Ottawa Auditorium]] in [[Ottawa]]. Led by goaltender [[Georges Vezina]], Montreal won 3-0 to sweep the series, and claim the Cup.<ref name="zeman30" />

In [[1924-25 WCHL season|1924-25]], the Tigers once again finished the regular season in first place, earning a bye into the WCHL championship.  Their opponent was the [[Victoria Cougars]], who moved over to the WCHL following the collapse of the PCHA the previous summer.  The Tigers were unable to earn a return trip to the Stanley Cup Finals, falling in two games to the eventual champion Cougars.<ref>{{Harvnb|Zeman|1986|p=31}}</ref>

By 1926, the financial pressures of trying to keep up with rapidly escalating salaries took its toll on the league, and the WCHL finally ceased operations, selling its best players to the NHL for $300,000.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sandor|2005|p=35}}</ref> The Tigers joined four other teams to form the Prairie Hockey League.  The Tigers would last only one season in the new league before folding, but the franchise went out as champions, capturing the [[1926-27 PrHL season|1926-27 championship]] in controversial fashion.  The Tigers defeated the [[Saskatoon Sheiks]] 2-1 in the opening game in Calgary, and then won the title by default after the Sheiks refused to play the second game due to their anger at the officiating in the first game.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sandor|2005|p=36}}</ref>  The PrHL would last only one more season itself, as it folded following the [[1927-28 PrHL season|1927-28 season]].

Following the demise of the Tigers, Calgary would have to wait nearly 50 years before major league hockey returned in 1975 with the [[Calgary Cowboys]] of the [[World Hockey Association]].

===North Western Hockey League===
In 1932, the Tigers were revived as a charter franchise of a reformed, minor-professional, Western Canada Hockey League. The Tigers finished atop the league standings in the first season, but fell to their provincial rivals, the Edmonton Eskimos, in a championship marred by bad ice caused by unseasonably warm weather in both Calgary and Edmonton.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sandor|2005|p=41}}</ref>  The league renamed itself the North Western Hockey League following the season after the Saskatchewan clubs dropped out.  

Calgary again won the regular season title in 1933-34, advancing to the league championship.  Fearing a repeat of the previous season's playoff disaster, the league ordered Calgary to play their championship series against the [[Vancouver Lions]] in [[Seattle, Washington]] and Vancouver as both cities had arenas capable of making artificial ice.  Despite the disadvantage, the Tigers captured the best-of-five championship with a 6-1 victory in the fifth and deciding game, held in Vancouver.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sandor|2005|p=43}}</ref>

The [[Great Depression]], and declining interest in professional hockey in favour of [[senior ice hockey|senior hockey]] ultimately led to the final demise of the Tigers in 1936 along with the North Western Hockey League itself.

==Hall of Famers==
The WCHL's short and unstable existence was a result of salary escalation caused by having three leagues competing for top talent.  As a result, by the mid 1920s, hockey players were among the highest paid athletes in North America, with top players able to demand even higher salaries than the top [[baseball]] stars of the time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sandor|2005|p=34}}</ref>  Though the WCHL lasted only five years, the Tigers boasted five future [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]rs on their roster during that time.<ref name="EOH" />

[[Barney Stanley]], a former PCHA star, spent two seasons with the Tigers from 1920-22, where he led the Tigers in scoring with 26 goals in 1921-22.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p196221&type=Player&page=bio&list=#photo |title=Barney Stanley profile |work=legendsofhockey.net |accessdate=2007-09-30}}</ref> 

[[Red Dutton]], a [[World War I]] veteran who refused doctors orders to have his leg amputated after suffering a shrapnel wound, played 123 games with the Tigers before moving to the NHL where he played 449 more with the [[Montreal Maroons]] and [[New York Americans]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p195805&page=bio&list=#photo |title=Red Dutton profile |work=legendsofhockey.net |accessdate=2007-09-30}}</ref>

[[Rusty Crawford]], a former standout in the [[National Hockey Association]] and National Hockey League before the war, spent three seasons in Calgary from 1922-25.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p196203&page=bio&list=#photo |title=Rusty Crawford profile |work=legendsofhockey.net |accessdate=2007-09-30}}</ref> 

[[Herb Gardiner]] began his professional career in Calgary in 1920, remaining with the Tigers until he was sold to the Montreal Canadiens in 1926, where he would go on to win the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] as NHL Most Valuable Player in 1927.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p195808&page=bio&list=#photo |title=Herb Gardiner  profile |work=legendsofhockey.net |accessdate=2007-09-30}}</ref> 

[[Harry Oliver]] also began his pro career in Calgary, playing with the Tigers from 1921-26 where he scored 90 goals before being sold to the NHL's [[Boston Bruins]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p196703&page=bio&list=#photo |title=Harry Oliver  profile |work=legendsofhockey.net |accessdate=2007-09-30}}</ref>
