The '''House of Wisdom''' ({{lang-ar|'''بيت الحكمة'''}}; ''Bait al-Hikma'') was a key institution in the [[Translation Movement]] - a library and translation institute in [[Abbassid]]-era [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-22884/Iraq Iraq: The 'Abbasid Caliphate], [[Encyclopedia Britannica]]</ref> It is considered to have been a major intellectual center of the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. The House of Wisdom acted as a society founded by [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]]s [[Harun al-Rashid]] and his son [[al-Ma'mun]] who reigned from 813-833 CE.  Based in Baghdad from the 9th to 13th centuries, many of the most learned Muslim scholars were part of this excellent research and educational institute.  In the reign of al-Ma'mun, [[Observatory|observatories]] were set up, and The House was an unrivalled centre for the study of [[humanities]] and for [[Islamic science|sciences]], including [[Islamic mathematics|mathematics]], [[Islamic astronomy|astronomy]], [[Islamic medicine|medicine]], [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|chemistry]], [[zoology]] and [[Islamic geography|geography]].  Drawing on [[Persian Empire|Persian]], [[History of India|Indian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] texts&mdash;including those of [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Hippocrates]], [[Euclid]], [[Plotinus]], [[Galen]], [[Sushruta]], [[Charaka]], [[Aryabhata]] and [[Brahmagupta]]&mdash;the scholars accumulated a great collection of knowledge in the world, and built on it through their own discoveries. Baghdad was known as the world's richest city and centre for intellectual development of the time, and had a population of over a million, the largest in its time.<ref name="Modelski">[[George Modelski]], ''World Cities: –3000 to 2000'', Washington DC: FAROS 2000, 2003.  ISBN 2-00309-499-4.  See also [http://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/ Evolutionary World Politics Homepage].</ref>  The great scholars of the House of Wisdom included [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|Al-Khawarizmi]], the "[[Fathers of scientific fields|father]]" of [[algebra]], which takes its name from his book ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Kitab al-Jabr]]''.

== Origins ==
In the [[Abbasid Empire]], scholars translated many foreign works into [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]  , built large libraries, and welcomed scholars persecuted by the [[Byzantine Empire]] <ref name="Wiet. Baghdad">[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/wiet.html Wiet. Baghdad<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. There was also an imperial library in [[Ctesiphon]] (now [[Al-Mada'in]])<ref>[http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/ctesiphon/ctesiphon.htm Ctesiphon<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.nestorian.org/ctesiphon.html Ctesiphon<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, and works were also translated at the [[Academy of Gundishapur]],  during the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]].
In [[750]], the [[Abbasid]] dynasty replaced the [[Umayyad]] dynasty as head of the Islamic empire, and in [[762]], the caliph [[al-Mansur]] (reigned 754 - 775) built Baghdad and made it his capital (the previous capital being [[Damascus]]). The Abbasid dynasty had a strong Persian bent<ref name="Wiet. Baghdad"/>, and adopted many practices from the Sassanid empire - among those, that of translating foreign works, except that now works were translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. For this purpose, al-Mansur founded a palace library, modeled after the Sassanid Imperial Library.

The House of Wisdom was originally concerned with translating and preserving Persian works, first from [[Pahlavi]] (Middle Persian), then from [[Syriac]] and eventually [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]].

Works on [[astrology]], [[mathematics]], [[agriculture]], [[medicine]], and [[philosophy]] were thus translated.

The [[Barmakids]] were influential in the ensuing movement of restoring and preserving Persian culture. They are also credited with the founding of the first [[paper mill]] in Baghdad. The secret of [[papermaking]] had been obtained from Chinese prisoners taken at the [[Battle of Talas]] (751). Previously, copyists would used [[papyrus]] (which is fragile) or [[parchment]] (which is expensive). The introduction of paper thus facilitated the multiplication of books and libraries.

The concept of the [[library catalog]] was also introduced in the House of Wisdom and other medieval Islamic libraries, where books were organized into specific [[genre]]s and categories.<ref>{{citation|last=Micheau|first=Francoise|contribution=The Scientific Institutions in the Medieval Near East|pages=988-991}} in {{Harv|Morelon|Rashed|1996|pp=985-1007}}</ref>

== Under Al-Ma'mun ==

Under the sponsorship of caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] (reigned 813 - 833), it seems that the House of Wisdom took on new functions related to mathematics and astrology. The focus also shifted from Persian to Greek texts.

At that time, the library was directed by the poet and astrologer [[Sahl ibn-Harun]] (d. 830); the other scholars associated with the library are [[al-Khawarizmi|Mohammed ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi]] (780 - 850), the [[Banu Musa brothers]] ([[Mohammed Jafar ibn Musa]], [[Ahmad ibn Musa]], and [[al-Hasan ibn Musa]]), and [[al-Kindi|Yaqub ibn Ishaq al-Kindi]] (801 - 873).

[[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]] (809 - 873) was placed in charge of the translation work by the caliph. The most renowned translator  was the [[Sabians of Harran|Sabian]] [[Thabit ibn Qurra]] (826 - 901). Translations of this era were superior to earlier ones, however, soon after, the emphasis on translation work declined, as new ideas became more important.

The House of Wisdom flourished under al-Ma'mun's successors [[al-Mu'tasim]] (reign 833 - 842) and [[al-Wathiq]]  (reign 842 - 847), but declined under the reign of [[al-Mutawakkil]] (reign 847 - 861), mainly because Ma'mun, Mu'tasim, and Wathiq followed the sect of [[Mu'tazili]], while al-Mutawakkil followed orthodox [[Islam]]. He wanted to stop the spread of Greek philosophy which was one of the main tools in [[Mu'tazili]] theology.

The House of Wisdom eventually acquired a reputation as a center of learning, although [[universities]] as we know them did not yet exist at this time &mdash; transmission of knowledge was done directly from teacher to student, without any institutional surrounding. [[Madrasah]]s soon began to develop in the city from the 9th century, and in the 11th century, [[Nizam al-Mulk]] founded the [[Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad]], considered one of the first universities<ref>[http://www.ghazali.org/works/gz-repent.doc Al-Ghazali on Repentance]</ref> and the "largest [[Medieval university|university of the Medieval world]]".<ref>[http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/index/1F7AAVLC25YV4PF2.pdf A European Civil Project of a Documentation Center on Islam]</ref>

== Destruction ==

Along with all other libraries in Baghdad, the House of Wisdom was destroyed during the [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|Mongol invasion of Baghdad]] in 1258. It was said that the waters of the [[Tigris]] ran black for six months with ink from the enormous quantities of books flung into the river.

== Other Houses of Wisdom ==

Some other places have also been called ''House of Wisdom'':

* In [[Cairo]], ''Dar al-Hikmah'', the "House of Wisdom", was another name of the [[House of Knowledge]], founded by the Fatimid Caliph [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] in 1004.

* There is a research institute in Baghdad called ''Bayt al-Hikma'' after the Abbasid-era research center. While the complex includes a 13th century [[madrasa]], it isn't the same building as the medieval ''Bayt al-Hikma''. It was damaged during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

* In  [[Hamdard University]], Pakistan, a library was founded by [[Hakim Said]] in 1989. It was named as ''Bait Ul-Hikmah'' . It is considered as the second biggest library in Asia.<ref>http://www.ihikmah.com/about.php?id=2</ref>
