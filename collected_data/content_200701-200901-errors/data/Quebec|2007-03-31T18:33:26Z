'''Quebec''' ({{pronounced|kʰwəˈbɛk}} or {{IPA|[kʰəˈbɛk]}}) or, in [[French language|French]], '''Québec''' (pronounced {{IPA|[kebɛk]}}),<ref name=EFname /> is a [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] in [[Eastern Canada]].

It is bordered to the west by the [[province]] of [[Ontario]], [[James Bay]] and [[Hudson Bay]]. To the north are the [[Hudson Strait]] and [[Ungava Bay]], to the east the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], the provinces of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], and to the south the [[United States]] (the states of [[New York]], [[Vermont]], [[New Hampshire]] and [[Maine]]).  It also shares maritime borders with the Territory of [[Nunavut]] and the provinces of [[Prince Edward Island]] and [[Nova Scotia]]. 

Quebec is Canada's largest province by area and its second-largest [[Canada#Administrative divisions|administrative division]]; only the territory of [[Nunavut]] is larger. It is the second most populated province, and most of its inhabitants live along or close to the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. The central and north portion of the province is sparsely populated and inhabited by the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal peoples of Canada]].

The [[official language]] of Quebec is [[French language|French]]; it is the sole Canadian province whose population is mainly [[French Canadian]], and where [[English language|English]] is not an official language at the provincial level.

Quebec, then called [[Canada (New France)|Canada]], formed part of the [[French colonial empires|colonial empire]] of [[New France]] until the [[Seven Years' War]], when it was conquered by [[United Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]; the 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] formally transferred the colony to British possession. Quebec became a [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of the [[Canadian Confederation]] upon its founding in 1867.

While the province's substantial natural resources have long been the mainstay of its economy, Quebec has renewed itself to function effectively in the [[knowledge economy]]: information and communication technologies, aerospace, biotechnology, and health industries.  

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Quebec}}
===Provincial boundary expansions===
[[Image:Canada provinces evolution.gif|thumb|left|Evolution of the borders of the Province of Quebec since 1867]]
In 1870, Canada purchased [[Rupert's Land]] from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and over the next few decades the [[Parliament of Canada]] transferred portions of this territory to Quebec that would more than triple the size of the province.<ref>[[Parliament of Canada|Library of the Parliament of Canada]], [http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/bp412-e.htm#B].</ref> In 1898, the Canadian Parliament passed the first [[Quebec Boundary Extension Act, 1898|Quebec Boundary Extension Act]] that expanded the provincial boundaries northward to include the lands of the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal]] [[Cree]]. This was followed by the addition of the [[District of Ungava]] through the [[Quebec Boundaries Extension Act, 1912|Quebec Boundaries Extension Act of 1912]] that added the northernmost lands of the aboriginal [[Inuit]] to create the modern Province of Quebec.

===Current territory===
As a result of the boundary expansions, the province currently occupies a vast territory (nearly three times the size of [[France]]), most of which is very sparsely populated. More than 90 percent of Quebec's area lies within the [[Canadian Shield]] and includes the greater part of the [[Labrador Peninsula]]. 
The most populated region is the [[St. Lawrence River]] valley in the south, where the capital, [[Quebec City]], and the largest city, [[Montreal]], are situated. North of Montreal are the [[Laurentian mountains|Laurentians]], a mountain range, and to the east are the [[Appalachian Mountains]] which extend into the [[Eastern Townships]] and [[Gaspésie]] regions. Quebec's highest mountain is [[Mount Caubvik|Mont D'Iberville]], which is located on the border with [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] in the northeastern part of the province.  The [[Gaspé Peninsula]] juts into the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] to the east.

The northern region of [[Nunavik]] is [[subarctic]] or [[arctic]] and is mostly inhabited by [[Inuit]]. A major [[hydroelectricity|hydro-electric]] project is found on the La Grande and Eastmain rivers in the James Bay region (the [[James Bay Project|La Grande Complex]]) and on the [[Manicouagan River]], north of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

==Climate==
Quebec has three main climate regions. Southern and western Quebec, including most of the major population centres, have a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Koppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with warm, humid summers and long, cold winters. The main climatic influences are from western and northern [[Canada]] which move eastward and from the southern and central [[United States]] that move northward. Due to the influence of both storm systems from the core of [[North America]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]], precipitation is abundant throughout the year, with most areas receiving more than 1,000 mm (40 inches) of precipitation, including over 300 cm (120 inches) of snow in many areas. Severe summer weather (such as [[tornado]]es and [[severe thunderstorm]]s) are far less common than in southern [[Ontario]], although they occasionally occur.

Most of central Quebec has a [[subarctic climate]] (Koppen ''Dfc''). Winters here are long and among the coldest in eastern Canada, while summers are warm but very short due to the higher latitude and the greater influence of [[Arctic]] air masses. Precipitation is also somewhat less than farther south, except at some of the higher elevations.

The northern regions of Quebec have an [[arctic climate]] (Koppen ''ET''), with very cold winters and short, much cooler summers. The primary influences here are the [[Arctic Ocean]] currents (such as the [[Labrador Current]]) and continental air masses from the [[High Arctic]].

==History==
{{main|History of Quebec}}
===First Nations: before 1500===
[[Algonquian language|Algonquian]], [[Iroquoian language|Iroquoian]] and [[Inuit]] groups were the first peoples to populate what is now Québec. Their lifestyles and cultures reflected the land on which they lived. Seven Algonquian groups lived nomadic lives based on hunting, gathering, and fishing in the rugged terrain of the Canadian Shield: (James Bay [[Cree]], [[Innu]], [[Algonquin]]s) and Appalachian Mountains ([[Mi'kmaq]], [[Western Abenaki|Abenaki]]). [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians]] lived more settled lives, planting squash and maize in the fertile soils of St. Lawrence Valley. The Inuit continue to fish, whale, and seal in the harsh Arctic climate along the coasts of Hudson and Ungava Bay. These peoples traded fur and food, and sometimes warred with each other. 

The name "Quebec", which comes from an Algonquin word meaning "strait" or "narrowing", originally meant the narrowing of the St. Lawrence River off what is currently Quebec City. There have been variations in spelling of the name:
* Québecq &mdash; Levasseur, 1601
* Kébec &mdash; Lescarbot, 1609
* Québec &mdash; Champlain, 1613

===Early European exploration: 1000&ndash;1600===
[[Viking]] longboats from [[Scandinavia]] carried the first [[Europe]]ans to the Arctic shores of the [[Ungava Peninsula]] around 1000 CE. [[Basque people|Basque]] whalers and fishermen traded furs with Saguenay natives throughout the 1500s.[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0000550]

The first French explorer to reach Quebec was [[Jacques Cartier]], who planted a cross either in [[Gaspé]] in 1534 or at [[Old Fort Bay]] on the [[Lower North Shore]]. He sailed into the [[St. Lawrence River]] in 1535 and established an ill-fated colony near present-day Quebec City at the site of [[Stadacona]], an Iroquoian village.

===New France===
{{main|New France}}

[[Samuel de Champlain]] was part of a 1603 expedition from France that traveled into the [[St. Lawrence River]]. In 1608, he returned as head of an exploration party and founded [[Quebec City]] with the intention of making the area part of the [[French colonial empire]]. Champlain's ''Habitation de Quebec'', built as a permanent fur trading outpost, was where he would forge a trading, and ultimately a [[military]] alliance, with the [[Algonquin]] and [[Huron]] nations. Natives traded their furs for many French goods such as metal objects, guns, alcohol, and clothing.

[[Helen Desportes]], born July 7, 1620, to French habitants Pierre Desportes and his wife Françoise Langlois, was the first child of European descent born in Quebec.

From Quebec, [[Voyageurs]], [[Coureurs des bois]], and Catholic missionaries used river [[canoe]]s to explore the interior of the North American continent, establishing fur trading forts on the [[Great Lakes]] ([[Étienne Brûlé]] 1615), [[Hudson Bay]] ([[Pierre-Esprit Radisson|Radisson]] and [[Médard des Groseilliers|Groseilliers]] 1659-60), [[Ohio River]] and [[Mississippi River]] ([[Robert Cavelier de La Salle|La Salle]] [[1682]]), as well as the [[Prairie River]] and [[Missouri River]] ([[Pierre Gaultier de Varennes et de la Vérendrye|de la Verendrye]] [[1734]]-[[1738]]). 

After [[1627]], King [[Louis XIII of France]] introduced the [[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneurial system]] and forbade settlement in [[New France]] by anyone other than [[Roman Catholic]]s. [[Sulpician]] and [[Jesuit]] clerics founded missions in [[Trois Rivières]] (Laviolette) and Montréal or Ville-Marie ([[Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve]] and [[Jeanne Mance]]) to convert [[New France]]'s [[Huron]] and [[Algonkian]] allies to [[Catholicism]]. The seigneurial system of governing New France also encouraged immigration from the motherland.

New France became a Royal Province in 1663 under King [[Louis XIV of France]] with a [[Sovereign Council of New France|Sovereign Council]] that included [[intendant of New France|intendant]] [[Jean Talon]]. This ushered in a golden era of [[French colonization of the Americas|settlement and colonization]] in New France, including the arrival of les "[[Filles du Roi]]". The population would grow from about 3,000 to 60,000 people between 1666 and 1760. Colonists built farms on the banks of St. Lawrence River and called themselves "[[Canadiens]]" or "[[Habitants]]". The colony's total population was limited, however, by a winter climate significantly harsher than that found in France; by the spread of diseases; and by the refusal of the French crown to allow [[Huguenots]], or French Protestants, to settle. The population of New France lagged far behind that of the [[13 Colonies]] to the south, leaving it vulnerable to attack.

===Conquest of New France===
In 1753 France began building a series of forts in the British [[Ohio Country]]. They refused to leave after being notified by the British Governor and in 1754 [[George Washington]] launched an attack on the French [[Fort Duquesne]] (now [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]) in the [[Ohio Valley]] in an attempt to enforce the British claim to take territory. This frontier battle set the stage for the [[French and Indian War]] in North America. By 1756, France and Britain were battling the [[Seven Years' War]] worldwide. In 1758, the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] mounted an attack on [[New France]] by sea and took the French fort at [[Louisbourg]]. 

On 13 September 1759, General [[James Wolfe]] defeated General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]] on the [[Plains of Abraham]] outside Quebec City. France ceded its [[North America]]n possessions to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] through the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]]. By the [[British Royal Proclamation of 1763]], Canada (part of New France) was renamed the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]].

In 1774, fearful that the French-speaking population of Quebec (as the colony was now called) would side with the rebels of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] to the south, the British Parliament passed the [[Quebec Act]] giving recognition to French law, Catholic religion and French language in the colony; before that Catholics had been excluded from public office and recruitment of priests and brothers forbidden, effectively shutting down Quebec's schools and colleges. The first British policy of assimilation (1763-1774) was deemed a failure. Both the petitions and demands of the Canadiens' élites, and Governor [[Guy Carleton]], played an important part in convincing London of dropping the assimilation scheme, but the looming American revolt was certainly a factor. By the Quebec Act, the Quebec people obtained their first Charter of rights. That paved the way to later official recognition of the [[French language]] and [[French culture]]. The Act allowed ''[[Canadiens]]'' to maintain French [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and sanctioned the freedom of religious choice, allowing the [[Roman Catholic Church]] to remain. It also restored the [[Ohio Valley]] to Quebec, reserving the territory for the fur trade.

The act, designed to placate one North American colony, had the opposite effect among its neighbors to the south. The Quebec Act was among the [[Intolerable Acts]] that infuriated [[13 colonies|American colonists]], who launched the [[American Revolution]]. A [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|1775 invasion]] by the American [[Continental Army]] met with early success, but was later repelled at [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|Quebec City]]. However, the [[American Revolutionary War]] was ultimately successful in winning the independence of the Thirteen Colonies. With the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], Quebec would cede its territory south of the [[Great Lakes]] to the new United States of America.

===The ''Patriotes''' Rebellion in Lower and Upper Canada===
{{main|Lower Canada Rebellion}}
Like their counterparts in [[Upper Canada]], in 1837, [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French speaking]] residents of Lower Canada, led by [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]] and [[Robert Nelson]], formed an armed resistance group to seek an end to British colonial rule. They made a Declaration of rights with equality for all citizens without discrimination, and a Declaration of Independence in 1838. Their actions resulted in rebellions in both Lower and Upper Canada. An unprepared [[British Army]] had to raise a local [[militia]] force and the rebel forces were soon defeated after having scored a victory in [[Saint-Denis, Quebec]], east of [[Montreal]].  The British army also burned alive the rebels who were hiding in the Church of St-Eustache.  The bullet and cannonball marks on the walls of the church are still visible to this day.

===Act of Union===
After the rebellions, [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]] was asked to undertake a study and prepare a [[Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839)|report]] on the matter and to offer a solution for the British Parliament to assess. The final report recommended that the population of Lower Canada be assimilated. Following Durham's [[Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839)|Report]], the British government merged the two colonial provinces into one [[Province of Canada]] in 1841. However, the union proved contentious. Reformers in both Canada West (formerly Upper Canada) and Canada East (formerly Lower Canada) worked to repeal limitations on the use of the French language in the Legislature. The two colonies remained distinct in administration, election, and law. In 1849, Baldwin and LaFontaine, allies and leaders of the Reformist party, obtained the grant (from [[Lord Elgin]]) for responsible government and returned the French language to legal status in the Legislature.

===Canadian Confederation===
In the 1860s, the delegates from the colonies of [[British North America]] (Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland) met in a series of conferences to discuss self-governing status for a new confederation. The first [[Charlottetown Conference]] took place in [[Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island]] followed by the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]] in Quebec City which led to a delegation going to [[London]], [[England]] to put forth the proposal for the national union. As a result of those deliberations, in 1867 the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] passed the [[British North America Act]], providing for the Confederation of most of these provinces. The former [[Province of Canada]] was divided into its two previous parts as the provinces of [[Ontario]] (Upper Canada) and Quebec (Lower Canada). [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] joined Ontario and Quebec in the new [[Canada|Dominion of Canada]]. Prince Edward Island joined in 1873 and the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] entered Confederation in 1949.

===The "Quiet Revolution"===
{{main|Quiet Revolution}}
The [[conservatism|conservative]] government of [[Maurice Duplessis]] and his [[Union Nationale (Canada)|Union Nationale]] dominated Quebec politics from 1944 to 1960 with the support of the [[Roman Catholic]] church. [[Pierre Trudeau]] and other liberals formed an intellectual opposition to Duplessis's regime, setting the groundwork for the [[Quiet Revolution]] under [[Jean Lesage]]'s [[Parti libéral du Québec|Liberals]]. The Quiet Revolution was a period of dramatic social and political change that saw the decline of Anglo supremacy in the Quebec economy, the decline of the Roman Catholic Church's influence, the [[nationalization]] of [[hydro-electric]] companies under [[Hydro-Québec]] and the emergence of a sovereignist movement under former Liberal minister [[René Lévesque]]. 

The Quiet Revolution has been described by some people as the time when everyone stopped going to church; so that by the end of 1963 the Catholic churches were virtually empty. Whether this is a factual comment or simply an expression of the felt change that Quebec was going through at the time, it provides a telling commentary to the widespread change that the people in Quebec underwent during the Quiet Revolution. The period spawned [[Quebec sovereignty movement|a significant movement for statehood]] which resulted in two [[referendum]]s (in 1980 and 1995) which rejected sovereignty-association.  

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Qcuds.jpg|thumb|right|The slogan on the current Quebec [[license plate]], first introduced in 1978, is "[[Je me souviens]]"; French for "I remember". It has been Quebec's motto since Confederation. {{speedy-image-c|[[2007-04-03]]}}]]  -->Beginning in 1963, a [[terrorism|terrorist]] group that became known as the [[Front de libération du Québec]] (FLQ) launched a decade of bombings, robberies and attacks directed primarily at English institutions, resulting in at least five deaths. In 1970, their activities culminated in events referred to as the [[October Crisis]] [http://www.mcgill.ca/maritimelaw/history/crisis/] when [[James Cross]], the British trade commissioner to Canada, was kidnapped along with [[Pierre Laporte]], a provincial minister and Vice-Premier, who was murdered a few days later. In their published Manifesto, the terrorists stated: "In the coming year Bourassa (Quebec Premier) will have to face reality; 100,000 revolutionary workers, armed and organized."

At the request of Premier [[Robert Bourassa]], Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] invoked the [[War Measures Act]]. Once the emergency Act was in place, arrangements were made for all detainees to see legal counsel{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. In addition, the Quebec [[Ombudsman]] [http://www.protecteurducitoyen.qc.ca/en/index.asp], Louis Marceau, was instructed to hear complaints of detainees and the Quebec government agreed to pay damages to any person unjustly arrested (only in Quebec). On February 3, 1971, [[John Turner]], the [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice of Canada]], reported that 497 persons had been arrested{{Fact|date=February 2007}} throughout Canada under the War Measures Act, of whom 435 had been released. The other 62 were charged, of which 32 were crimes of such seriousness that a [[Quebec Superior Court]] judge refused them bail. The crisis ended after a few weeks after the death of Pierre Laporte at the hands of his captors. The fallout of the crisis marked the zenith and twilight of the FLQ which lost membership and public support. 

In 1977, the newly elected [[Parti Québécois]] government of [[René Lévesque]] introduced the [[Charter of the French Language]]. Often known as [[Bill 101]], it defined French as the only official language of Quebec in areas of provincial jurisdiction.

===The Parti Québécois and constitutional crisis===
Lévesque and his party had run in the 1970 and 1973 Quebec elections under a platform of separating Quebec from the rest of Canada. The party failed to win control of Quebec's National Assembly both times &mdash; though its share of the vote increased from 23% to 30% &mdash; and Lévesque himself was defeated both times in the [[Electoral district (Canada)|riding]] he contested. In the 1976 election, he softened his message by promising a referendum (plebiscite) on [[sovereignty-association]] rather than outright separation, by which Quebec would have independence in most government functions but share some other ones, such as a common currency, with Canada. On November 15, 1976, Lévesque and the Parti Québécois won control of the provincial government for the first time. The question of [[sovereignty-association]] was placed before the voters in the [[1980 Quebec referendum]]. During the campaign, [[Pierre Trudeau]] promised that a vote for the NO side was a vote for reforming Canada. Trudeau advocated the [[patriation]] of Canada's Constitution from the [[United Kingdom]]. The existing constitutional document, the [[British North America Act]], could only be amended by the [[United Kingdom Parliament]] upon a request by the Canadian parliament.

Sixty percent of the Quebec electorate voted against the proposition. Polls showed that the overwhelming majority of English and immigrant Quebecers voted against, and that French Quebecers were almost equally divided, with older voters less in favour, and younger voters more in favour. After his loss in the referendum, Lévesque went back to Ottawa to start negotiating a new constitution with Trudeau, his minister of Justice [[Jean Chrétien]] and the nine other provincial premiers. Lévesque insisted Quebec be able to veto any future constitutional amendments. The negotiations quickly reached a stand-still. 

Then on the night of November 4, 1981 (widely known in Quebec as ''La nuit des longs couteaux'' or the "Night of the Long Knives"'), [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau]] met all the provincial premiers except [[René Lévesque]] to sign the document that would eventually become the new Canadian constitution. The next morning, they put Lévesque in front of the "fait accompli." Lévesque refused to sign the document, and returned to Quebec. In 1982, Trudeau had the new constitution approved by the British Parliament, with Quebec's signature still missing (a situation that persists to this day). The Supreme Court of Canada confirmed Trudeau's assertion that every province's approval is not required to amend the constitution.

In subsequent years, two attempts were made to gain Quebec's approval of the constitution. The first was the [[Meech Lake Accord]] of 1987, which was finally abandoned in 1990 when the provinces of [[Manitoba]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] refused to support it. This led to the formation of the sovereignist [[Bloc Québécois]] party in [[Ottawa]] under the leadership of [[Lucien Bouchard]], who had resigned from the federal cabinet. The second attempt, the [[Charlottetown Accord]] of 1992, was rejected by 56.7% of all Canadians and 57% of Quebecers. This result caused a split in the [[Parti libéral du Québec|Quebec Liberal Party]] that led to the formation of the new [[Action Démocratique]] (Democratic Action) party led by [[Mario Dumont]] and Jean Allaire.

On October 30, 1995, with the [[Parti Québécois]] back in power since 1994, a [[1995 Quebec referendum|second referendum]] on sovereignty took place. This time, it was rejected by a slim majority (50.6% NO to 49.4% YES); a clear majority of French-speaking Quebecers voted in favour of sovereignty.

The referendum was enshrouded in controversy. Federalists complained that an unusually high number of ballots had been rejected in pro-federalist areas, notably in the largely Jewish and Greek riding of Chomedey (11.7 % or 5,500 of its ballots were spoiled, compared to 750 or 1.7% in the general election of 1994) although Quebec's chief electoral officer found no evidence of outright fraud. The Government of Canada was accused of not respecting provincial laws with regard to spending during referendums (leading to a corruption scandal that would become public a decade later, greatly damaging the Liberal Party's standing), and to having accelerated the naturalization of immigrant people living in the province of Quebec (43,850 immigrants were naturalized in 1995, whereas the average number between 1988 and 1998 was 21,733).

The same night of the referendum, an angry [[Jacques Parizeau]], then premier and leader of the "Yes" side, declared that the loss was due to "[[money and the ethnic vote]]". Parizeau resigned over public outrage and as per his commitment to do so in case of a loss. [[Lucien Bouchard]] became Quebec's new premier in his place.

Federalists accused the sovereignist side of asking a vague, overly complicated question on the ballot. Its English text read as follows:
<blockquote>
''Do you agree that Québec should become sovereign after having made a formal offer to Canada for a new economic and political partnership within the scope of the bill respecting the future of Québec and of the agreement signed on June 12, 1995?''
</blockquote>
After winning the next election, Bouchard retired from politics in 2001. [[Bernard Landry]] was then appointed leader of the [[Parti Québécois]] and premier of Quebec. In 2003, Landry lost the election to the [[Parti Libéral du Québec|Quebec Liberal Party]] and [[Jean Charest]]. Landry stepped down as PQ leader in 2005, and in a crowded race for the party leadership, [[André Boisclair]] was elected to succeed him. The PQ has promised to hold another referendum should it return to government.

Given the province's heritage and the preponderance of French (unique among the Canadian provinces), there is an ongoing debate in Canada regarding the status of Quebec and/or its people (wholly or partially).  Prior attempts to amend the Canadian constitution to acknowledge Quebec as a '[[distinct society]]' – referring to the province's uniqueness within Canada regarding law, language, and culture – have been unsuccessful; however, the federal government under [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]] Jean Chrétien would later endorse recognition of Quebec as a distinct society.  On [[October 30]], [[2003]], the National Assembly voted unanimously to affirm "that the quebecers form a [[nation]]".<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.saic.gouv.qc.ca/publications/resolutions/20031030.pdf ''Résolution de l'Assebmblée Nationale du Québec'', October 30, 2003]|95.4&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 97740 bytes -->}}</ref>
On [[November 27]] [[2006]], the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] passed a motion moved by prime minister [[Stephen Harper]] declaring that "this House recognize[s] that the [[Québécois]] form a nation within a united Canada."<ref>[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Pub=hansard&Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=39&Ses=1&DocId=2544166&File=0#SOB-1798651 Hansard; 39th Parliament, 1st Session; No. 087; November 27, 2006]</ref><ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20061128.wnation28/BNStory/National/home Galloway, Gloria; Curry, Bill; Dobrota, Alex; ''Globe and Mail'': 'Nation' motion passes, but costs Harper; November 28, 2006]</ref><ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20061127.wchong1127/BNStory/National Bonoguore, Tenille; Sallot, Jeff; ''Globe and Mail'': Harper's Quebec motion passes easily; November 27, 2006]</ref> As only a motion of the House, it is not legally binding.

== Government ==
{{main|Politics of Quebec|Monarchy in Quebec}}

The [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Quebec|Lieutenant Governor]] represents [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as [[head of state]]. The head of government is the [[List of Quebec premiers|Premier]] (called ''premier ministre'' in French) who leads the largest party in the [[unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] or ''Assemblée Nationale'', from which the Council of Ministers is appointed.

Until 1968, the Quebec [[legislature]] was [[bicameral]], consisting of the [[Legislative Council of Quebec|Legislative Council ]] and the [[Legislative Assembly of Quebec|Legislative Assembly]]. In that year the Legislative Council was abolished, and the Legislative Assembly was renamed the National Assembly. Quebec was the last province to abolish its legislative council.

The government of Quebec awards an order of merit called the [[National Order of Quebec]]. It is inspired in part by the [[France|French]] [[Légion d'honneur|Legion of Honour]]. It is conferred upon men and women born or living in Quebec (but non-Quebecers can be inducted as well) for outstanding achievements.

== Administrative subdivisions ==
''Main article: [[Administrative subdivisions of Quebec]]''

Quebec has subdivisions at the regional, supralocal and local levels. Excluding administrative units reserved for Aboriginal lands, the primary types of subdivision are:

At the regional level:
*17[[regions of Quebec|administrative regions]].
At the supralocal level:
*86 [[regional county municipality|regional county municipalities]] or RCMs (''municipalités régionales de comté'', ''MRC''); 
*2 [[metropolitan community|metropolitan communities]] (''communautés métropolitaines'').
At the local level:
*1,117 [[types of municipalities in Quebec|local municipalities]] of various types;
*11 [[Municipal reorganization in Quebec|agglomerations]] (''agglomérations'') grouping 42 of these local municipalities;
*within 8 local municipalities, 45 [[list of boroughs in Quebec|boroughs]] (''arrondissements'').

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Quebec}}
[[Image:Montreal Twilight Panorama 2006.jpg|thumb|center|590px|[[Montreal]], North America's Francophone metropolis]]

<p>The St. Lawrence River Valley is a fertile agricultural region, producing [[dairy]] products, [[fruit]], [[vegetable]]s, [[foie gras]], [[maple syrup]] (Quebec is the world's largest producer), and [[livestock]].</p>

North of the St. Lawrence River Valley, the territory of Quebec is extremely rich in resources in its coniferous forests, lakes, and rivers—pulp and [[paper]], [[lumber]], and [[hydroelectricity]] are still some of the province's most important industries.

High-tech industries are very important around Montreal. It includes the aerospace companies like aircraft manufacturer [[Bombardier]], the jet engine company [[Pratt & Whitney]], the flight simulator builder [[CAE (company)|CAE]] and defence contractor [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed Martin, Canada]]. Those companies and other major subcontractors make Quebec the fourth biggest player worldwide in the aviation industry. 

[[Image:Château Frontenac.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Château Frontenac]], the world's most photographed hotel, is iconic to the province of Quebec.]]

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Quebec}}
Quebecers comprise the largest French-speaking society in the [[Americas]]. Most [[French Canadians]] live in Quebec, though there are other concentrations of French-speakers throughout Canada with varying degrees of ties to Quebec. [[Montreal]] is the cosmopolitan cultural heart of Quebec.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}<!-- History made Quebec a place where cultures meet, where people from all over the world experience America, but from a little distance and through a different eye. Often described as a crossroads between Europe and America, Quebec is home to a people that are connected to the strong cultural currents of the [[United States]], [[France]], and the [[UK]] all at the same time.-->

Quebec is also home to 11 aboriginal nations and to a large [[English-speaking Quebecer|English-speaking minority]] of approximately 600,000 people.

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Quebec}}
Quebec's [[fertility rate]] is now among the lowest in Canada. At 1.48, it is well below the replacement fertility rate of 2.1. This contrasts with the fertility rate before 1960 which was among the highest of any industrialized societies. Fertility rate in 2006 is of 1.61.

Although Quebec represents only 24% of the population of Canada, the number of international adoptions in Quebec is the highest of all provinces of Canada. In 2001, 42% of international adoptions in Canada were carried out in Quebec.

Quebec has a high-school dropout rate of 16%, the second highest such percentage in the Canadian provinces, behind [[Prince Edward Island]].[http://www11.hrsdc.gc.ca/en/cs/sp/hrsdc/arb/publications/research/2002-000121/page06.shtml]

The information regarding ethnicities at the left is from the [http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo26f.htm 2001 Canadian Census].
The percentages add to more than 100% because of dual responses (e.g., "French-Canadian" generates an entry in both the category "French" and the category "Canadian".) Groups with greater than 70,000 responses are included.

===Religious groups===
Quebec is unique among the provinces in its overwhelmingly [[Roman Catholic]] population. This is a legacy of colonial times; only Catholics were permitted to settle in the [[New France]] colony. 
* 90.2% [[Christian]]
** 83.3% [[Roman Catholic]]
** 4.7% [[Protestant]]
** 1.4% [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]]
** 0.8% other [[Christianity|Christian]]
* 7.1% [[non-religious]]
* 1.5% [[Muslim]]
* 1.2% [[Jewish]]

==Language==
{{main|Demolinguistics of Quebec}}
Quebec is the only Canadian province where French is the only official language. In 2001 the population was: [http://www.stat.gouv.qc.ca/regions/recens2001_17/langue17/materuni17_an.htm]
* French speakers: 82.0%
* English speakers: 7.9%
* Others: 10.1% (Italian 5.2%, Spanish 2.3%, Arabic 2.9%, and others)

==Symbols and emblems==
[[Image:Quebecois flag.jpg|thumbnail|250px|The '''Fleurdelisé''' leads a ship to harbour near Quebec City.]]
The motto of Quebec is [[Je me souviens|''Je me souviens'' ("I remember")]], which is carved into the Parliament Building façade in Quebec City and is seen on the coat of arms and licence plates.

The graphic emblem of Quebec is the [[fleur-de-lis]], usually white on a blue background, as on the [[flag of Quebec]], the ''Fleurdelisé''. As indicated on the government of Quebec's Web site, the flag recalls the French [[French monarchs|Royal]] banner said to have accompanied the army of [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm|General Montcalm, Marquis de Saint-Véran]] during the victorious [[battle of Carillon]] in 1758. While the fleur-de-lis, a symbol of France's [[Ancien Régime]], may be thought of as "counter-revolutionary" in France today, it is a modern symbol in Quebec (which was never ruled by the French Republic) and is prominent in its [[coat of arms of Quebec|coat of arms]].

The floral emblem of Quebec is the ''[[Iris versicolor]]''. It was formerly the [[Madonna lily]], to recall the fleur-de-lis, but has been changed to the iris, which is native to Quebec. 

The avian emblem of Quebec is the [[Snowy Owl|snowy owl]].

In addition to the other emblems, an insect emblem has been chosen by popular vote in October 1998 during a poll sponsored by the [[Montreal Insectarium]]: The [[Limenitis arthemis|White Admiral]] (''Limenitis arthemis'') [http://www2.ville.montreal.qc.ca/insectarium/toile/info_insectes/fiches/fic_fiche08_amiral.htm] won with 32 % of the 230 660 votes. The butterfly was in competition with four other candidates: the Spotted [[Coccinellidae|lady beetle]] (''Coleomegilla maculata lengi''), the Ebony Jewelwing [[damselfly]] (''Calopteryx maculata''), a species of [[bumble bee]] (''Bombus impatiens'') and the six-spotted [[tiger beetle]] (''Cicindela sexguttata sexguttata''). The [http://www.mddep.gouv.qc.ca/ministere/inter_en.htm Ministère du Développement durable, de l’Environnement et des Parcs] supports and finances actions to officially recognize the White Admiral as the insect emblem.

The patron saints of French Canada are [[Saint Anne]] and [[John the Baptist]]. ''La Saint-Jean'', [[June 24]], is Quebec's national day and has been officially called the [[Fête nationale du Québec]] since 1977. The song "[[Gens du pays]]" by [[Gilles Vigneault]] is sometimes regarded as Quebec's unofficial anthem.
