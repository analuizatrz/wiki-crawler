As the name of the team implied, their [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] was that they were a pair of [[headbanging|headbangers]], complete with [[Heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]] related T-shirts and piercings.

The team first debuted on WWF TV as the '''Sisters of Love''', proteges of manager [[Bruce Prichard|Brother Love]] who dressed as [[nun]]s.

They were both playable characters in ''[[WWF War Zone]]'' and ''[[WWF Attitude]]''. The teams only major success came when the won the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championships]].
