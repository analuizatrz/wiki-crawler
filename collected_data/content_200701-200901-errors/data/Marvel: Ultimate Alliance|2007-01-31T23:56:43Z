'''''Marvel: Ultimate Alliance''''' is an [[action role-playing game]] released by [[Raven Software]] and [[Activision]] in October 2006 in U.S. Previously referred to as '''''Marvel-Legends''''', this game features more than 20 characters which are available to players and 140 character appearances in total.

==Story==
{{spoiler}}

[[Doctor Doom|Dr. Doom]] has formed a new and improved [[Masters of Evil]] who are in pursuit of an "unknown" goal. They launch an attack on a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[helicarrier]]. [[Nick Fury]] sends out a distress call to all available superhumans. [[Captain America]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Spider-Man]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] respond and proceed to eliminate Doom's forces. 

After saving the helicarrier, Nick is given the authority by S.H.I.E.L.D. to create a special task force of superhumans to counter the Masters of Evil. Since the helicarrier is too badly damaged to serve as an HQ, [[Iron Man]] gives Colonel Fury permission to use [[Stark Tower]]. The team's first mission is to sneak onboard the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Omega Base, a massive, mobile laboratory containing many top secret experiments, and prevent the Masters from smashing it into a dam. While there, the Masters steal the Super Soldier Formula and the Mutant Amplifier, a device that can increase the power of any mutant. The Masters also attempt to set off a Gamma Bomb and and steal upgrades for [[Ultron]], but they are foiled by the heroes. After stopping the base from crashing and defeating [[M.O.D.O.K.]], the team heads to Atlantis. The Atlanteans have revolted against their king, [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]], and Nick Fury believes the Masters may have something to do with it. When the team arrives in Atlantis, they find that Namor has been captured and is being tortured by his people. [[Namorita]] tells the heroes that [[Attuma]] has staged a coup and taken Namor's throne. The heroes go on to defeat Attuma and restore Namor to his throne. After they defeat Attuma, the heroes see [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] in the Atlantean Catacombs stealing the Tome of Asarius. The heroes then pursue Mandarin to his palace in China to discover more of the Masters's plans. Upon defeating Mandarin, the heroes discover that Mandarin split his ties with the Masters long ago. After Mandarin attempted to become the leader of the Masters, Doom expelled him from the group. Mandarin tells the heroes that the Mandarin they saw was most likely [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], who has recently joined the Masters. Once they acquire this information, the heroes return to Stark Tower. Nick Fury then informs the team that the Masters have kidnapped two [[X-Men]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Jean Grey]], and Colonel Fury is moving their base to the [[Doctor Strangeâ€™s Sanctum Sanctorum|Sanctum Sanctorum]].
     
Nick Fury tells the team that, now that they know Loki is involved with the Masters of Evil, they will need [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]]'s expertise in magic, which is why the team's base has been moved to the Sanctum, Dr. Strange's home. Professor X has also joined the team in the Sanctum to help them locate the missing X-Men. The Professor tells the team he has located Nightcrawler in [[Latveria|Castle Doom]] by using [[Cerebro]]. Dr. Strange's assistant [[Wong (comics)|Wong]] prepares the Orb of Teleportation to get the heroes to Castle Doom, but [[Clea]], senses an unknown Dark Magic spell in the Sanctorum. When the heroes teleport to Castle Doom, all seems normal until they are attacked by Jean Grey, who is under some kind of mind control. After Jean flees the battle, the team discovers that the Dark Magic spell was crafted by [[Baron Mordo]], another member of the Masters, to disrupt the teleporter to send the heroes to Murderworld by [[Arcade (comics)|Arcade]]. The team travels through Murderworld, saving Jean Grey and defeating Arcade, who tells the heroes that Dr. Doom is planning on using the Mutant Amplifier on Nightcrawler to travel to the realm of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]. The heroes follow the Masters to Mephisto's realm to save Nightcrawler and Jean Grey, who is recaptured by Mephisto. The heroes make a difficult choice and must choose to save only one X-Man. After saving either Nightcrawler or Jean Grey, the heroes fight and beat Mephisto, who tells them that Doom traded Nightcrawler to him in exchange for the Twilight Sword. After acquiring this knowledge, the team returns to the Sanctum to have Nick Fury tell them that Asgard, the realm of the Norse Gods, has fallen to the Masters of Evil. After freeing Asgard, the team comes fights Loki and defeats him. Soon after, they come into contact with Doctor Doom (who has kidnapped Odin and has stolen his powers) and [[comic book death|kills]] the team. But the team is saved by [[Uatu|Uatu the Watcher]], who could not stand and watch Doom take over the universe. 
  
Uatu tells the heroes that the only way to fight Doom is to steal some of the power from him. To do that they must obtain two items. First, they board a Shi'ar ship in order to ask Empress Lilandra, who is good friends with the X-Men, to borrow a powerful crystal used by the Shi'ar. When they board the ship, they meet [[Corsair]], father of Cyclops, who tells them that [[Deathbird]], Lilandra's sister, has taken over the ship. After defeating her, they save Lilandra, manage to stop the ship from self-destructing, and get what they came for. When they return, Uatu tells the team that they must now steal the Muonic Inducer from [[Galactus]]. After stealing, the device from the consumer of planets, with help from the [[Silver Surfer]], the heroes learn that the people of earth have begun changing, the land along with them. They also learn that other Super-Heroes (such as [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]) have tried to stop Doom. Of course they fail, and Doom creates evil copies of them. When the heroes arrive at Doom's Castle in Latveria, they come into contact with many dark versions of Cyclops, Spider-Man, Captain America, Thor, and many more. They find Doom, only to have his own dark version of the Fantastic Four waiting alongside him. After stealing a bit of power from him, the heroes defeat Doom, rescue Odin, and save the world. Doom and Loki are forever tortured by Odin for what they did.

After all this, Nick Fury tells the team that they must disband. Wolverine says to him "You're a punk, Fury." and walks off, with Spidey and Thor following behind him. Captain America then says to Fury that if he ever needs them again, they will provide their assistance. Then, the screen moves over to Galactus, who vows to destroy the heroes and Earth for stealing from him.

After that, Uatu tells the player of how his/her actions in the game (such as not completing missions the right way, or not completing side missions) change the future. For example, if the player chooses to save Jean Grey and not Nightcrawler, [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] will seek out [[Professor X]] and kill him. Another is that if the player did not save [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Kelly]], he will create a bill that forces all mutants be sent to reeducational camps, re-educating them to NOT use their powers. So, from another point of view, if the player does not complete all the missions, including optional ones, then the future will still change somehow, and the world would one day be put in danger again.

During the game a subplot takes place where [[Weasel (comics)|Weasel]] attempts to find proof that the Black Widow is a double agent, and the player needs to obtain various pieces of information to aid his efforts. Ultimately the players call Nick Fury with information of Black Widow's apparent betrayal, it is revealed that Black Widow is innocent and her suspicious activities were part of an operation to try and retrieve plans that Dr. Doom had stolen from S.H.I.E.L.D. The plan, Operation: All Father was created for if the Asgardians became threats to humans and involved stealing Odin's power with the Twighlight Sword, which is exactly what Doom does. After the closing credits, there is also a dialogue between Weasel and Black Window, with Weasel going into S.H.I.E.L.D. records for her. During this it is revealed that Black Widow is indeed some kind of double agent, and she has set up Weasel for the fall.

==Features==
The game features over 140 characters from the Marvel Universe. Players are able to create teams, and have online and co-operative play, for up to 4 players. In arcade mode players will have to fight for the most kills in order to get the experience points at the end of the level. There are also special comic book missions, revisiting a moment in a character's past and facing a classic arch rival. Characters may have up to four costumes, which can alter the stats of the character.

Players will fight in mid air, underwater and on the ground, with fully destructible and interactive environments in over 17 locations, traveling around different locales on planet Earth, different dimensions, and even the depths of space by the end of the game. The game has alternative endings, affected by the decisions the player(s) make throughout the game. These endings are based on whether or not the player chooses to complete optional missions.

The game is quite rewarding for fans of Marvel's characters, providing lots of bonuses and nods to knowledgeable fans who know their comic history. Putting together teams of characters who have a shared history together, for example, may give team bonuses (ex. using [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man (comics)|Iron Man]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Ms. Marvel]] on the same team would yield you the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], giving you a boost in attack damage for all team members). Using particular characters to interact with other NPCs can also yield additional dialogue, and villains will also react accordingly when met with their nemeses (for example, [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] will talk directly to [[Elektra Natchios|Elektra]] or [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] upon seeing those characters in the first chapter). The game also features trivia games, artwork and many more references to the Marvel Universe.

While many characters in the game by default are rendered with the appearance they have in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of comics, the world of the game is predominantly based upon that of the [[Earth 616|original Marvel Universe]], with many villains, character designs and references to events that exist only in that continuity (for example, [[Galactus]] is the original Marvel Universe's version, not Ultimate Marvel's hive-minded robotic version).

==Versions==
The game is available for the [[Xbox]], [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[Wii]] and PC. The graphical engine and looks differ between the various platforms. For the 6th gen consoles ([[PlayStation 2|PS2]] and [[Xbox]]), characters models are similar to ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse|X-Men Legends II]]'' style. The 7th generation (PS3, Wii, and Xbox 360) versions will feature more detailed character models and environments. The PC version vary depending on the customization of a user's settings, at maximum settings and shaders with premium hardware, the PC graphics will be similar to or better than the 7th gen. The PC version also features "intuitive mouse controls" [http://www.marvelultimatealliance.com/game_info.php] and works with a gamepad. 

There are exclusive characters on the GBA, PSP, Wii, Xbox 360 and PS3. The PSP has four exclusive characters, the GBA has two exclusive characters, and the three next-gen systems share two exclusive characters. [[Moon Knight]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] (the next-gen exclusive characters) are now playable on the PC version as well with a game mod. MUA VIP site has offically announced that there will be downloadable characters on the Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Marketplace at some point in March(No specific date has yet to be announced other than 'March') no other details have been announced and it has not been said whether any other platforms will have access to these characters.

===GBA===
Marvel: Ultimate Alliance's graphics are reduced to a comparatively very low graphic quality for the [[Game Boy Advance|GBA]] version. 
*Just like the other versions, players can switch between any character during the game. Players can also create their own team involving only 3 characters. Also, some characters aren't available on the GBA, such as [[Black Panther]]. [http://vip.marvelultimatealliance.com/board/viewtopic.php?t=2159]

**Two exclusive characters: [[Jean Grey]] and [[Namor]].
*Interactive environments; players can take advantages and use this to track their enemies.
*Some additional gameplay modes added including: S.H.I.E.L.D. Simulator, Time Challenges, Scavenger Hunts, and a Survival mode.

===PSP===
The [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] version features simplified graphics, different characters, and extra features:

*One exclusive comic book villain: [[Andreas Strucker|Swordsman]]

The [[Wii]] version features:
*Specific motion-sensitive controls for normal moves
*Motion-sensitive controlled Special attacks, unique for each character
*Access to any special move at any time, which is unavailable for any other build. (The only other version to use this would be the PC version.)
*There is no online play, but there is a normal multiplayer mode in which up to four players may play at once.

==Characters==
While ''Ultimate Alliance'' follows in the footsteps of Raven Software's ''[[X-Men Legends]]'' games, it has a broader scope of inclusion, adding playable heroes from [[Marvel Comics]]' other popular comics, including [[Spider-Man]], many different members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and the entire [[Fantastic Four]]. In addition, each character has four different costumes. Most of these extra costumes are different costumes characters have had in their comics appearances; for example, Spider-Man has his black symbiote costume and his red and gold [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Tony Stark's "Iron Spider" costume|"Iron Spider"]] costume, as well as his classic red and blue costume. Some of the costumes are alternate versions of the same character or even entirely separate characters with similar powers or appearance: for example, many characters appear in their [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] versions, and both versions of the character [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] as well as the [[MC2]] character [[Spider-Girl]] are available via the costume change feature.

One major thing to note is that the version of Nick Fury used for Alliance is not the same as previously appeared in the X-Men Legends game. The [[Ultimate Nick Fury|General Nick Fury]] model that was previously used is still available as an alternate costume for Fury, however.

While all versions of ''Ultimate Alliance'' share a common core of initially-available and unlockable characters, many of the different versions have exclusive characters. The PC, [[PlayStation 2]], and [[Xbox]] versions have only the basic core, while the PlayStation Portable version adds four characters, the Xbox 360, Playstation 3 and Wii versions share a pair of exclusive characters, and the Game Boy Advance version has two exclusive characters while lacking some of the unlockable characters.

It has been reported that in March, there will be new characters available for download on the next-gen systems.  No word yet on exactly which characters it will be.

{{spoiler}} 
Characters that appear as alternate costumes are listed under the original character.<br>
:''All playable characters have four different costumes, except [[Moon Knight]], who has three.''<br>
:''In the case of [[Silver Surfer]], all of his alternate costumes look the same.''
Characters in bold are not available at the beginning of the game, and become available during gameplay. All characters in italics are costume changes for other characters that are of different personas altogether.

==Trivia==
* Post-credits, a phone call is heard between Black Widow & Weasel, leading to the game's final twist. This is possibly a homage to the [[Metal Gear series|Metal Gear Solid]] series, which has done this at the end of the ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' & ''[[Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater]]'' games. Ironically, several of the Ultimate Alliance voice actors have had significant roles in the Metal Gear series.
* In the cutscene prior to the final attack on Doom's castle, [[Scott Summers|Cyclops]] is depicted wearing his ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' costume. However,when the player fights him, Cyclops is wearing his ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' costume.
* [[The Hulk]] was going to be the final playable character, but as the rights to use the character are held by another company, this was not possible. However, the player meets Bruce Banner in the Omega Base & sees a defeated Hulk in a cinematic prior to the final mission.

* [[The Punisher]] also had been taken out of the game because [[THQ]] had the rights for this character.

==Reception==
===Awards===
*Received the Video Game of the Year award from [[Wizard Magazine]] issue 183.
*Received the IGN Award for Best Story on PlayStation 3 in 2006.
