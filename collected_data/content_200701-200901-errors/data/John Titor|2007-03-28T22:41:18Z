'''John Titor''' is the name used by the person or persons claiming to be a [[time travel]]er from the year [[2036]] who posted on several [[time-travel]]–related [[bulletin board]]s during [[2000]]/[[2001]]. In these posts he made numerous ambiguous [[prediction]]s about events in the near [[future]], starting with events in 2004.

Whether or not John Titor was a [[hoax]] has been a topic of [[controversy]] on web-based [[Anomalous phenomenon|paranormal]] [[Internet forum|discussion board]]s. He has also been discussed occasionally on the radio show [[Coast to Coast AM]].

==Titor's claims==
Most of the [[BBS|electronic bulletin board posts]] made by "John Titor" no longer exist. Titor posts appeared at ''Time Travel Institute,'' ''Anomalies Net'', and ''Time Travel Portal'', among other places. Darby @ Anomalies Network has copied the Titor-related threads from these bulletin boards. Titor made his first post there as "TimeTravel_0". More recently the story has been collected into a number of more "narrative" web sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johntitor.com|title=John Titor - Time Traveler|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

===Origins===
When asked if John Titor was his real name, he responded that John Titor is ''a'' real name.
    
In his online postings, Titor claimed to be an American soldier from the year 2036 who was assigned to a [[government]] time travel project. He was supposedly sent back to [[1975]] to retrieve an [[IBM 5100]] computer which he claimed was needed to "[[debug]]" various legacy computer programs in 2036. According to [[IBM]] [[engineer]] Bob Dubke, Titor's statements regarding the IBM 5100's ability to [[emulation|emulate]] and debug [[mainframe]] systems were correct. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20051210175724/http://www.postbulletin.com/magazine/2004/08/index.shtml|title=Time traveler most likely to be spotted in Rochester, IBM 5100 Engineer Bob Dubke on hidden features|publisher=''Rochester Magazine''|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref> It has been stated that this information was not publicly available when Titor made his declaration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johntitor.com/Pages/5100.html|year=2005|title=News about the 5100 Computer|accessdate=March 15|accessyear=2007}}</ref> He claimed he was making a stopover in 2000 in order to observe the effects of the [[Y2K bug]], and this is when he started posting to the discussion groups. 

Titor made many contradictory statements with regard to his age. In 2000, Titor wrote that he had met his 2-year-old self, implying a birthdate in [[1998]]. On other occasions, however, he claimed to have been a 13-year-old soldier in [[2015]] during [[World War III]], and a frightened 14-year-old boy in [[2012]] hiding during the 7th year of a supposed future American [[civil war]].

===The time machine===

When questioned about the mechanisms of time traveling, Titor answered that he was no engineer. Nevertheless, some of these postings described the time machine and how it worked.

He described it as a "C204 time distortion gravity displacement machine' built by [[General Electric]] in 2034. It weighed approximately 500 pounds and was transported in a 1966 [[Chevrolet Corvette]] convertible. The vehicle remained stationary with the engine switched off while traveling through time. Apparently the time machine was removed from the Corvette and placed in a 1987 four wheel drive truck. According to the posts, there were six main components to his time machine:

# Two dual micro-singularities
# An electron injection system
# A cooling system
# Gravity sensors
# Four caesium [[atomic clock]]s
# Three computers

The posts stated that the "two top-spin, dual positive singularities", produced a "standard off-set Tipler sinusoid". The mass and gravitational pull of the micro singularities were manipulated by injecting electrons onto its surface, replicating the effects of a Kerr-Newman [[black hole]]. When pressed for further details, he would claim he "was not an engineer", which seemed at odds with his statement about tracking down an IBM computer. Nevertheless, he also posted images of the machine, and its effects on the beam of a [[laser pointer]] when operating, as well as posting parts of its technical manual. When asked to provide a better picture of his time machine, he replied that he wasn't a [[photographer]].

When asked why the time machine did not lead to [[grandfather paradox|time travel paradoxes]], he stated that this was explained through the [[many-worlds interpretation]] (or as it was called, the  Everett-Wheeler model), which he claimed was proven to be correct in the future. Simplistically, the Many Worlds theory suggests that for any event that could have different possible outcomes, ''every'' one of those outcomes occurs in a separate "universe". According to the posts, a time traveler does not actually enter their own past, but some other, similar, past. When asked to use the time machine to perform some [[paradox]]ical action, he replied that that would only affect this [[universe]], but not his. He appeared to imply that there were many [[worldline]]s, and his [[time machine]] could not control its outgoing destination exactly, but could return to a worldline exactly similar to his own home. His originating "worldline" would, in turn, receive a John Titor exactly similar to the original. Therefore, his original "worldline" would indeed receive the benefit of his mission.

===Predictions===

The postings also described various future events between 2004 and 2037, including World War III (predicted for 2015) followed by two decades of recovery.

One such entry cited escalating conflict between [[Arab]]s and [[Jew]]s as a harbinger of World War III:

:"Real disruptions in world events begin with the destabilization of [[the West]] as a result of degrading US [[foreign policy]] and consistency. [...] The Jewish population in [[Israel]] is not prepared for a true offensive war. They are prepared for the ultimate defense. Wavering western support for Israel is what gives Israel's neighbors the confidence to attack. The last resort for a defensive Israel and its offensive Arab neighbors is to use [[weapons of mass destruction]]. In the grand scheme of things, the war in the [[Middle East]] is a part of what's to come, not the cause."

Along with this report of World War III's approach, another notable claim was that of a civil war in America, which was slated to begin in 2004, around the time of the presidential election, and would escalate until 2008 which, according to Titor, is "a general date by which time everyone will realize the world they thought they were living in was over." Another claim was that 2004 would be the last year in which the [[Olympic Games]] would occur.

These are taken from [http://www.abovetopsecret.com/pages/the_john_titor_project.html John Titor's original statements] and summarised.
* 2004 would be the last official Olympics due to global conflicts.
* A Second American Civil War from 2004 to 2018 dividing the large cities against the rural areas
* An event similar to the "[[Passage of the Red Sea|parting of the Red Sea]]" will occur in 2012.
* [[Association Football]] ([[soccer]]) becomes the most popular sport in the [[United States]]. 
* Third World War in 2015, a gradual global escalation that was ended by [[Russia]] bombing American, European, and Chinese cities.
** Sometime before this point (referred to as "N-Day"), China forcefully annexes [[Japan]], [[Korea]], and [[Taiwan]].
** [[Chemical weapons|Chemical]] and [[biological weapons]] are used, and some [[Less-lethal weapons|"non-lethal" weapons]] turned out to be quite lethal.
** [[Australia]] successfully repels a Chinese invasion.
** The war kills almost 3 billion people.

==Evidence of hoaxing==

A cursory examination of the claims suggests several problems with the alleged story.

For instance, he describes a future in which money is largely dispensed with in favor of communal bartering, but in other cases claims that money is widely used and they still have [[credit card]]s. These claims appear to be opposed, it does not seem obvious how one could operate a credit system with widespread barter because of the smaller number of cash transactions this would imply. In another post he speculated that today's money would be usable in his time, but this would be after the collapse of the federal government according to his own history, which would make the money worthless.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.livejournal.com/hoaxes/90359.html|title=Tackling John Titor, Time Traveller|date=2003-11-25|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

Other predictions have simply proven not to be true. For instance, he stated that the Olympics would end in 2004, but this proved contrary to subsequent real-world events as the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] were successfully held. He also predicted that the US would be breaking down into a civil war starting in 2004, or in other posts 2005, and that "Wako-like" events (referring to the [[Waco Siege]] of 1993) would be commonplace today. In light of such predictive failings supporters have speculated, ''[[logical fallacies|ex post facto]]'', that the [[history]] relayed by Titor could have referred to ''one possible'' course for the future, suggesting that [[human]]s may have since created an [[alternate future]] by going about things differently. This [[apologist|apologetic]] approach is exemplary of the more forgiving interpretations for Titor's specific errors.

In addition, it seems odd that Titor would make such predictions about the U.S. after 2004 but fail to mention the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and the subsequent [[War on Terror]].

In terms of physics, the explanation of the time machine's workings are [[technobabble]], a pastiche of terms that could be found in a general science magazine or science fiction work. Of particular interest is the fact that the device is implied to be a [[Tipler Cylinder]], but one well known "side effect" of this device is that it can only be used to travel to times in which the device already existed &ndash; Titor ''could'' travel into the past with one, but only to 2034, which is when he claimed it was first built.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A6345407 John Titor: a Time Traveller From The Year 2036?]</ref> It has been suggested that the description of the system has been copied with almost no modification from a particular work, the general science book ''[[Hyperspace (book)|Hyperspace]]'' written by Dr. [[Michio Kaku]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Brown|year=2003|url=http://communities.anomalies.net/forum/ubbthreads.php/ubb/showflat/Number/13443/page/1#Post13443|title=Dr. Robert Brown's Replies to Darby RE. Titor|publisher=The Anomalies Network Forums|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

The images are likewise problematic. The image of the laser pointer's beam being "bent" has the obvious problem that objects around the beam are not bent. For instance the framing of the window visible in the background shows no distortion, which would not be the case if there was a large gravity gradient in the area. Some have speculated it is a [[fiber optic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread62046/pg1|title=John Titor: Hoax|date=2004-06-26|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

Titor claimed that he was sent back to obtain an IBM 5100 because it could emulate mainframes. Supporters have implied that this capability was a "secret" that was not known in 2000/1 when the posts were being made. However, this capability was actually widely known in the industry, and commented on in depth in numerous publications, both about the 5100 and APL in general.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/304/ibmsj3004C.pdf|year=1991|title=The IBM Family of APL Systems, IBM Systems Journal|accessdate=March 15|accessyear=2007}}</ref> References to this fact were also available on the internet as early as 1999. This is a fairly obscure bit of trivia, however, which suggests whoever was making the posts was familiar with the machine, or had an interest in [[retrocomputing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johntitor.strategicbrains.com/|title=John Titor's Story|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

==In other media==
* In 2003, the John Titor Foundation published a book, ''John Titor: A Time Traveler's Tale'', discussing his claims (ISBN 1-59196-436-9).
* In 2004, [http://www.cyburbiaproductions.com/ Cyburbia Productions] presented ''Time Traveler Zero Zero'', a stage performance based on the Titor story.
* In 2005, [[Figure 26 Films]] produced the film [http://www.spacejunk.org/obsessed-scientific/ ''Obsessed & Scientific''], which touches upon time travel and includes the story of John Titor.
* [http://www.fasttrackproductions.biz/TimeTravel_0.html ''TimeTravel_0''], a film about Titor, is supposedly in production.
