'''Adonias''' Aguiar '''Filho''' (abbreviated "Fo."), writer and novelist from Bahia, Brazil. Member of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras]].

==Life==
Son of Adonias Aguiar and Rachel Bastos de Aguiar; b. 1915.

In [[1936]], 2 years after finishing high school in [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador]], he moved from the south of [[Bahia]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]’s capital at the time, where he continued his career in [[Journalism]], previously started in Salvador. He worked in renowned newspapers such as [[Correio da Manhã]]  as well as a literary [[critic]] for Cadernos da "Hora Presente", from [[São Paulo]] em [[1937]],  "A Manhã", from [[1944]] to [[1945]], besides "Jornal de Letras" (from [[1955]] to [[1960]]) and "Diário de Notícias" ([[1958]] to [[1960]]). In São Paulo, he also collaborated with [[O Estado de S. Paulo]] and "Folha da Manhã".

Between [[1946]] and [[1950]], he ran the book publishing company "A Noite". He was the director of the [[Serviço Nacional de Teatro]], in [[1954]], and director of the [[Biblioteca Nacional do Brasil|Biblioteca Nacional]] from  [[1961]] to [[1971]]. At the same time, he worked at the [[Agência Nacional]] at the [[Ministério da Justiça]].

In [[1966]] he was elected vice-president of the [[Associação Brasileira de Imprensa]] and in the following year, member of the [[Conselho Federal de Cultura]]. He was re-elected in [[1969]], [[1971]] and [[1973]]. He was the presidente of the Associação Brasileira de Imprensa in [[1972]] and president of the [[Conselho Federal de Cultura]] from [[1977]] to [[1990]], when he died.

As a [[Literature|writer]], Adonias Aguiar Filho searched for inspiration for his fiction in the "zona cacaueira" ([[Cocoa]] plantations) close to [[Ilhéus]], back to his origins in the South of [[Bahia]], where he was born and raised. This ambiance is noticed soon in his first novel, "Os servos da morte", published in [[1946]]. In the [[romance novel]], that reality served as an opportunity to recreate a world charged with symbolism, in the book passages as well as in the characters, bearing a tragic sense to life and the view of the world. He was part of the [[Grupo Festa]].

The use of original and sophisticated resources, adapted to the internal violence of his characters gave Adonias Filho a fundamental role at the Literature group that created the 3rd phase of [[Brazilian Modernism]] in [[1945]], which was based in a return to certain more formal disciplines of writing.  They were concerned about writing, on one hand, using less formal research of [[language]], though trying to expand their regional meanings to a universal paradigm. Their work is still an integral influence in contemporary [[Brazil]]ian [[literature]] and [[fiction]].

He was honored with the 21st chair at the Brazilian Academy of Letters ([[Academia Brasileira de Letras]]) at the age of 53, May 23rd, [[1969]]. The title was handed to him by his fellow writer also from Bahia, [[Jorge Amado]]. His literary work was translated to [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]] and [[Slovac language|Slovac]].

He died shortly after his beloved wife died.
