'''Robert Bernard 'Robbie' Fowler''', (born [[9 April]] [[1975]] in [[Toxteth]], [[Liverpool]], [[Merseyside]], [[England]]) is an [[England|English]] [[Football (soccer)|footballer]] who is a [[free agent]] after leaving [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. Fowler is the fourth [[FA Premier League#Top scorers|highest goalscorer]] in [[FA Premier League|Premier League]] history.

Fowler's career began with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. He signed as a youth team player on leaving school in the summer of [[1991]], signing professional terms on his 17th birthday, [[9 April]] [[1992]]. He made his first-team debut the following season and was soon established as a regular first-team player. Fowler scored 120 premiership goals for Liverpool in an eight year period. He subsequently played for [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], before returning to Liverpool in January 2006. He departed again 18 months later to sign for Cardiff City.  He refused a one year "pay as you play" contract offered summer 2008 and is training with [[Blackburn Rovers]] with a view to a one year deal.

He has been [[cap (football)|capped]] for [[England national football team|England]] twenty-six times, scoring seven goals. The most recent of these appearances came in the [[FIFA World Cup 2002|2002 World Cup]].

==Early life==
Fowler was born in Liverpool and brought up in the [[Toxteth]] area. At this time he was known as Robert Ryder, his mother's surname.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fowler |first=Robbie |coauthors=Maddock, David |title=Fowler: my autobiography |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |year=2005 |id=ISBN 1-4050-5132-9}} p22</ref> He lived in Toxteth at the time of the [[1981]] [[Toxteth riots]], when he was six years old. As a youngster he supported [[Everton F.C.]], regularly travelling to [[Goodison Park]]. He played regularly for schoolboy team Thorvald, and once scored 16 times in a 26–0 rout.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N156263070702-1648.htm |title=

In [[1986]], an 11-year-old Fowler was selected for Liverpool Schoolboys and was spotted by [[Liverpool F.C.]] scout Jim Aspinall. He began training with Liverpool once a week and signed schoolboy forms with the club. On leaving school in [[1991]] he signed as a [[Youth Training Scheme|YTS]] trainee, and turned professional on his 17th birthday less than a year later.<ref name="4thegame">{{cite web|url=http://www.4thegame.com/club/liverpool-fc/player-profile/574/robbiefowler.html |title=

==Career==
===Liverpool===
Fowler's first involvement with the Liverpool first team came on [[13 January]] [[1993]], when he was an unused substitute in an [[FA Cup]] third round tie against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. In the following close season, Fowler helped the [[England national under-18 football team|England Under-18]] team win the 1993 European Championship,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/U18s/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2003/07/56208.htm |title=
England Daz-zlers |publisher=The Football Association|accessdaymonth=21 August |accessyear=2007 }}</ref> before making a scoring first-team debut in Liverpool's 3&ndash;1 win in a first round [[Football League Cup|Coca Cola Cup]] tie at [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on [[22 September]] [[1993]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/team/squad/fowler/a_index.shtml |title=
1st Team Squad Profiles - Robbie Fowler |publisher=Liverpool FC official website|accessdaymonth=21 August |accessyear=2007 }}</ref> Fowler scored all five goals in the second leg at Anfield two weeks later, making him the fourth player in Liverpool's history to score five in a senior fixture.<ref name="4thegame"/> He scored his first league [[hat-trick]] against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in only his fifth league game. His first 13 games for the club yielded 12 goals, and he was rewarded with an [[England national under-21 football team|England Under-21]] debut against [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]] in November 1993, in which he scored England's opening goal in the third minute. Fowler was unable to sustain his goal-a-game ratio throughout the season, but finished his first season as the club's leading scorer with 18 goals in all competitions. It was, however, a disappointing season for Liverpool, as they finished eighth in the [[Premier League]] without making any impact in any of the major competitions, though the departure of [[Graeme Souness]] as manager and the appointment of [[Roy Evans]] as successor built up hope for the future.<ref name="4thegame"/>

In the [[1994-95 in English football|1994–95 season]], Fowler was an ever-present for Liverpool, playing in all of their 57 competitive matches, including the victory in the [[1995 Football League Cup Final|1995 League Cup final]], and a match against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in which he scored a hat-trick in four minutes and 33 seconds,<ref>''Fowler: My Autobiography, p128</ref> a Premiership record. Fowler was voted the [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] in two consecutive years in 1995 and 1996,<ref name="MEN factfile">{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester_city/s/147/147761_robbie_fowler_factfile.html|title=

Throughout the mid and late 1990s, Fowler was widely considered to be the most natural finisher playing in England.<ref>{{cite web|authorlink= |coauthors= |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2001/11/19/sfntal20.xml |title=
Gripping battle of the red predators |format= |pages= |publisher=The Telegraph | language= |accessdaymonth=19 June |accessyear=2006 }}</ref> Fowler sealed this reputation as he scored more than 30 goals for three consecutive seasons, up to 1997. [[Stan Collymore]], Fowler's strike partner from 1995 to 1997, said in his autobiography that Fowler was the best player he has ever played alongside. Fowler and Collymore were among the most prolific goal-scoring strike partnerships in England during the [[1995-96 in English football|1995–96]] season. In the same season he scored twice in a 4–3 victory over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], a match voted the best of the decade in a Premier League poll. The match helped prevent Newcastle from winning the league, but it was not enough for Liverpool to clinch the title; they finished third while [[Manchester United F.C.]] were crowned champions. Fowler also played in his first [[FA Cup final]] that season, but was on the losing side as Manchester United won 1-0.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=264175&root=england&cc=5739 |title=Ten years and counting |publisher=ESPN |accessdaymonth=24 September |accessyear=2007 }}</ref>

Fowler received a call-up to the [[England national football team|full England squad]] and won his first cap on [[27 March]],[[1996]], as a substitute in a [[friendly match|friendly]] against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]].<ref name="MEN factfile"/> His first start at international level was against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] which was the England game following his substitute appearance. Fowler was part of the England squad for [[1996 European Football Championship|Euro 96]], making two appearances in the tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfanzine.co.uk/squad/fowler.html|title= Season by season cap breakdown|publisher=...And Waddle Steps Up|accessdaymonth=16 September |accessyear=2007 }}</ref> On [[14 December]] [[1996]], he scored four against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], including his hundredth for Liverpool. This meant he reached a century of goals one game quicker than his first strike partner, [[Ian Rush]].

That year, he also won a [[UEFA]] [[UEFA Fair Play ranking|Fair Play]] award for admitting that he had not been fouled by, Arsenal [[goalkeeper]], [[David Seaman]] at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]] after a penalty had been given.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2000/12/18/sfnwes19.xml|title=
 Di Canio in line for fair play awards |publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdaymonth=23 August |accessyear=2007 }}</ref> After unsuccessfully trying to convince the referee to change his decision about the penalty Fowler took it tamely and Seaman saved. However, Seaman failed to hold on to the ball and [[Jason McAteer]] scored from the rebound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1997/03/25/sfguna25.html|title=
Collymore makes amends to keep Liverpool on title trail |publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdaymonth=23 August |accessyear=2007 }}</ref> Many people wrongly believe that Fowler deliberately took the penalty kick poorly for reasons of fair play. However, he later stated that "I tried to score. I never missed on purpose. It just happened, it was a bad penalty."<ref>[http://football.guardian.co.uk/theknowledge/story/0,,2162140,00.html Football: Knowledge: have any footballers ever missed a penalty on purpose? | Special Reports | guardian.co.uk Football<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Fowler was part of a group of Liverpool players from the mid-1990s who were nicknamed "The [[Spice Boys (footballers)|Spice Boys]]" by the press following a series of off-field controversies. The term was coined by the [[Daily Mail]], and arose due to misplaced rumours that Fowler was dating [[Spice Girls|Spice Girl]] [[Emma Bunton]].<ref>Fowler: My Autobiography, p171-173</ref> The term was subsequently used in a derogatory manner, implying Fowler and colleagues such as [[Jamie Redknapp]], Stan Collymore, [[David James (footballer)|David James]] and [[Steve McManaman]] were underachieving playboys. 

Fowler's performance in the [[1997-98 in English football|1997-98 football season]] was marred by a knee ligament injury that kept him out of action for half the season and caused him to miss the [[FIFA World Cup 1998|1998 World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2007/04/12/sfnfow12.xml|title=
 Fowler searches in vain for fitting end |publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdaymonth=23 August |accessyear=2007 }}</ref> During this period of injury, fellow Liverpool striker, [[Michael Owen]] rose to prominence, making his debut in 1997. Owen established himself in the Liverpool team in Fowler's absence. 

In 1999, Fowler was fined £60,000 by his club for bringing the game into disrepute. Whilst celebrating his goal against Liverpool's [[Merseyside]] rivals, Everton, Fowler used the white line of the [[Penalty area (football)|penalty area]] to simulate [[cocaine]] use.<ref> {{cite web |title=Prankster Faces Suspension |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=[[1999-04-07]] |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E2D91438F934A35757C0A96F958260 |accessdate=2008-08-12}} </ref><ref name="MEN factfile"/> Liverpool manager [[Gerard Houllier]] stated that this was a [[Cameroon]]ian grass eating celebration, learnt from teammate [[Rigobert Song]].<ref> {{cite web |last=Allsop |first=Derik |title=Football: Houllier defence is the real joke |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' |date=[[1999-04-05]] |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19990405/ai_n14223904 |accessdate=2008-08-07}} </ref> Defending himself, Fowler later said this was a response to Everton fans who had insulted him with false accusations of [[Recreational drug use|drug abuse]]. Fowler received a four match suspension from [[The Football Association|the FA]] for this incident. At the same FA disciplinary hearing, Fowler received a further two match suspension due to a separate incident in which he had taunted the [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] defender [[Graeme Le Saux]] by waving his backside at him as Le Saux's wife and children watched from the stands. Fowler later attempted to justify his actions by suggesting his homophobic taunts were simply an extension of gamesmanship. The FA imposed a £32,000 fine and a six match ban for the two incidents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,41304,00.html|title=Fowler hit with six-match ban and record fine |publisher=Guardian|accessdaymonth=26 August |accessyear=2007 }}</ref>

====2000-01 Season====
The [[2000-01 in English football|2000–01 season]] was Fowler’s most successful season. He appeared in three finals, scoring 17 goals and lifting three trophies in a unique [[The Treble|cup treble]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/1485742.stm|title=Liverpool primed for title assault|accessdate=2007-09-12 |publisher=BBC }}</ref>. In the absence of Jamie Redknapp, who was sidelined by injury, Fowler was named as Liverpool captain when he started.<ref name="4thegame"/> However he found himself the third choice Liverpool striker, with Houllier favouring a forward partnership of Michael Owen and [[Emile Heskey]].<ref name="4thegame"/>  

He did take part in a fourth round [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] hammering of [[Stoke City F.C]], scoring a hat trick in an 8–0 victory which beat the club's record 7-0 defeat of [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.]] in 1896.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20001130/ai_n14355735 |title=Football: Fowler hat-trick leads Liverpool record rout |accessdate=2007-08-23 |publisher=Independent }}</ref> In the [[Football League Cup Final 2001|League Cup final]] against [[Birmingham F.C.]], the club's first cup final since 1996, he captained the side and scored in 30th minute. Liverpool went on to win the trophy on penalties. Fowler picked up the [[Alan Hardaker]] [[Man of the Match]] award and lifted the trophy.

Fowler’s season picked up from there as he scored several important goals including a goal against runaway champions [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and a free kick in the [[FA Cup]] semi-final against [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]]. According to [[Steven Gerrard]]'s autobiography, [[Gary McAllister]] was supposed to take the free-kick, but Fowler, knowing this, pulled one of his infamous cheeky antics and struck it before McAllister could get there. McAllister was seen chasing Fowler around, and, according to the book:
 
''"People thought he [Gary Mac] was trying to congratulate Robbie. Bollocks! He was chasing him because he was going to throttle him!"''

Fowler featured as a substitute in the [[FA Cup Final 2001|2001 FA Cup Final]] coming on as a 77th minute replacement for [[Vladimír Šmicer]]. Liverpool, who were 1–0 down at that point, eventually won the game 2–1 with two goals from Michael Owen. Fowler raised the trophy along with [[Sami Hyypiä]] and Jamie Redknapp.

Four days later he was a substitute again in Liverpool’s third final, the [[2001 UEFA Cup Final]] against [[Deportivo Alavés]]. He came on in the 64th minute for Emilie Heskey with the score at 3–3. He scored seven minutes later but Alavés equalised before full time and Liverpool eventually won with a [[golden goal]], an own goal, in the 116th minute.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2001/05/16/sfgliv17.xml |title=UEFA Cup Final: Liverpool hit treble top |accessdate=2007-08-23 |publisher=Daily Telegraph}}</ref> Fowler and Hyypia then raised Liverpool’s third trophy of the season together. Liverpool’s next and final game of the season was against [[Charlton Athletic F.C.]] and Fowler scored twice in a 4–0 victory that assured them [[UEFA Champions League]] qualification for the next season.

====Liverpool departure====
Fowler began the [[2001-02 in English football|2001–02 season]] amidst controversy with then Liverpool manager [[Gérard Houllier]] when he was dropped from the entire squad for Liverpool's 2–1 victory in the 2001 [[Community Shield]] match against rivals Manchester United.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/1487707.stm |title=Fowler sweats on Anfield future   |accessdate=2007-05-26 |last= |first= date=2001-07-13 |publisher=bbc.co.uk }}</ref> He made an appearance in Liverpool's 3–2 [[European Super Cup]] victory over European Champions [[Bayern Munich]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/match/season/2001-2002/aug/149/teamsheet.htm |title=Liverpoolfc.tv : 2001-2002 : BAYERN MUNICH 2 - 3 LIVERPOOL   |accessdate=2007-05-26 |last= |first= date=2001-07-24 |publisher=bbc.co.uk }}</ref> but starts were intermittent. In October [[2001]], he scored his first league hat-trick for three years, helping Liverpool beat [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] 4&ndash;1, but was dropped for the following league game. Speculation over Fowler's future persisted for most of Houllier's tenure and became an issue that divided Liverpool fans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/sports_talk/1488513.stm |title=Is Fowler's Anfield future bleak?   |accessdate=2007-05-26 |last= |first= date=2001-08-12 |publisher=bbc.co.uk }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/1490333.stm |title=Fowler divides Liverpool fans   |accessdate=2007-05-26 |last= |first= date=2001-08-14 |publisher=bbc.co.uk }}</ref> His last appearance before for Liverpool was against [[Sunderland F.C.|Sunderland]], in which he was substituted at half-time.<ref>''Fowler: My Autobiography'', p317</ref>

===Leeds United===
Despite his popularity with Liverpool fans, who referred to Fowler as "God",<ref>{{cite web | title= 	
Liverpool - City of God | work=UEFA | url=http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/kind=512/newsid=390452.html| accessmonthday=August 23 | accessyear=2007 }}</ref>  a combination of off-field controversy, disputes with Gérard Houllier and training ground arguments with Assistant Manager [[Phil Thompson]] led to Fowler's departure to Leeds United.<ref name="ESPN">{{cite web | title= Robbie Fowler| work=ESPN Soccernet | url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7956&cc=5739| accessmonthday=September 10 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> Fowler maintains that Houllier forced him out of Liverpool, and accused Houllier of pressuring the [[Liverpool Echo]] newspaper to use its influence to turn opinion against him.<ref name="Observer">{{cite web | title=

The transfer went ahead just one month after his hat-trick at Leicester with a fee of £11 million. He made his Leeds debut in an away game against Fulham,<ref>{{cite web | title=

Fowler scored 12 goals in the remainder of the season, helping Leeds to a [[UEFA Cup]] qualifying place. Fowler was included in the England squad for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], but only made one appearance, coming on as substitute in a second round win over [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]. 

Fowler suffered an aggravation of a pre-existing hip injury in the [[2002-03 in English football|2002-03 pre-season]], and did not recover until December.<ref name="ESPN"/> Struggling to gain fitness, and seeing team-mates sold off due to a financial crisis, Fowler's form and market value diminished. However, in total he scored 15 goals in 31 appearances for Leeds; achieving an impressive strike rate of just less than one goal every two games. In 2002-03, Leeds finished 15th in the Premier League and a severe financial crisis was developing.

===Manchester City===
In the [[2002-03 in English football|2002–03 season]], Fowler was transferred to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] following a protracted transfer saga. Fowler initially turned down the move, and a dispute between Manchester City manager [[Kevin Keegan]] and chairman [[David Bernstein (executive)|David Bernstein]] over whether the transfer should take place due to medical concerns resulted in Bernstein leaving the club.<ref>{{cite web | title= The costly truth about Fowler| work=Manchester Evening News | url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester_city/s/132/132149_comment_the_costly_truth_about_fowler.html| accessmonthday=August 22 | accessyear=2007 }}</ref> Following encouragement from Keegan, Fowler finally signed for Manchester City on [[16 January]] [[2003]] for an initial fee of £3 million and a further £3 million dependent upon appearances.<ref name="MEN factfile"/> Bizarre transfer conditions meant Leeds United still paid a significant proportion of Fowler's wages.<ref>{{cite web | title= New Leeds chairman uncovers fishy past| work=Guardian | url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,9753,960304,00.html| accessmonthday=August 22 | accessyear=2007 }}</ref> Fowler made his Manchester City debut against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on [[1 February]] [[2003]],<ref>{{cite web | title= Baggies grab vital victory| work=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2694025.stm| accessmonthday=August 22 | accessyear=2007 }}</ref> but made a poor start to his Manchester City career, scoring just two goals in the remainder of the season. 

Fowler continued to struggle with fitness problems in the [[2003-04 in English football|2003–04 season]], completing the full 90 minutes only nine times, however he did score against his old club Liverpool in a 2&ndash;2 draw at home. The arrival of, close friend, Steve McManaman from [[Real Madrid]] gave Fowler hope, but the pair failed to rekindle their prolific partnership of yesteryear, and received criticism from the fans and tabloids for their salaries and alleged excesses.<ref>{{cite web | title= Spice Boy grows up| work=Guardian | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1308935,00.html| accessmonthday=June 21 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> In 2004 Fowler, depressed by his lack of form and fitness, considered retiring, but was persuaded to carry on by Keegan and [[Stuart Pearce]].<ref>Fowler: My Autobiography, p354-355</ref> He then showed a marked improvement in the second half of the [[2004-05 in English football|2004–2005 season]], scoring his 150th Premiership goal in the 3&ndash;2 win over [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] on [[28 February]] [[2005]]. However, his failure to convert a 90th minute penalty kick against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough's]] [[Mark Schwarzer]] in the final game of the season prevented Manchester City from gaining a place in the [[UEFA Cup]].<ref>{{cite web | title=  City pay the penalty for Fowler miss | work=Daily Telegraph | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2005/05/16/sfgmac16.xml| accessmonthday=August 21 | accessyear=2007 }}</ref> Despite this, Fowler ended the season as the club's joint top goal scorer and gained the approval of the fans, finishing in the top three in the fans' Player of the Year poll.<ref>{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=Manchester City - The Complete Record |publisher=Breedon |location=Derby |date=2006 |id=ISBN 1-85983-512-0}} p504</ref> Fowler later described this as "one of the proudest achievements of my career".<ref>Fowler: My Autobiography, p347</ref>

Fowler had injury problems at the start of the [[2005-06 in English football|2005–06 season]] and rarely featured when fit, making just two substitute appearances in the first four months of the season. His first start of the season came against [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] in the FA Cup on [[7 January]] [[2006]], in which he scored a hat-trick.<ref>{{cite web | title= Man City 3-1 Scunthorpe | work=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/4565242.stm| accessmonthday=August 21 | accessyear=2007 }}</ref> The following week he scored Manchester City's third goal in their 3&ndash;1 win against local rivals Manchester United after coming on as substitute. However, Fowler made only one more appearance for Manchester City before returning to Liverpool on a free transfer.<ref>{{cite web | title= Liverpool make shock Fowler swoop | work=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/4655944.stm| accessmonthday=September 12 | accessyear=2007 }}</ref>

===Return to Liverpool===
[[Image:76693565 b44605f726 2.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Anfield, where Fowler returned in February 2006]]
On [[27 January]] [[2006]], Fowler rejoined Liverpool from Manchester City on a free transfer, signing a contract until the end of the season. Fowler had remained a Liverpool fan after he left the club; he was in the [[Istanbul]] crowd when Liverpool won the Champions League in 2005.

The fans were overjoyed to learn that Fowler had returned; there were large banners in the game against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] which read 'God - number eleven, welcome back to heaven', with 'God' being Fowler's nickname while he was previously at Liverpool.

Fowler's return against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in February 2006 was labelled by the tabloid press as the stuff of fairytales,<ref> {{cite web | title= It's no Fowl up by Rafa| work=Sunday Mirror | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20060205/ai_n16049582| accessmonthday=September 25 | accessyear=2007 }}</ref> and he himself said he felt like "a kid waking up on Christmas morning every day".<ref> {{cite web | title= Liverpool: City of God| work=UEFA | url=http://fr.access.euro2004.com/magazine/news/kind=512/newsid=390452.html| accessmonthday=September 24 | accessyear=2007 }}</ref> Fowler's first appearance back at [[Anfield]] was as a substitute against Birmingham, receiving a standing ovation upon his introduction.<ref> {{cite web | title=  Alonso spoils return of Kop's prodigal son | work=Telegraph| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2006/02/02/sfgliv02.xml| accessmonthday=September 25 | accessyear=2007 }}</ref> After his return, he had three goals ruled out for offside, before finally getting off the mark on [[15 March]] [[2006]] in a home game against Fulham, the same opponents against which he scored his first ever goal for Liverpool 13 years earlier. 

Fowler's next Liverpool goal, against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], meant he overtook [[Kenny Dalglish]] in the club's all time top scorers. His resurgence continued as he marked his 31st birthday with a goal against Bolton Wanderers. He made it four goals in five games when he scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory over [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on [[16 April]] [[2006]]. However, Fowler's fitness remained a concern. In March 2006, manager [[Rafael Benitez]] commented on Fowler's work and progress by saying, "to buy a Robbie Fowler who is fit and scoring goals would cost a lot, maybe £10m or more". Despite concerns about his fitness, Fowler finished the [[2005-06 in English football|2005–06 season]] scoring on a more consistent basis than Liverpool's other strikers. In May 2006 he was offered a new one year contract with the club,<ref> {{cite web | title= Fowler to sign new Liverpool deal| work=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/4977356.stm| accessmonthday=May 21 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> and celebrated by scoring the first goal in Liverpool's last league game of the season in a 3–1 away win at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]. It was his final game of the season as he was unable to take part in the club's [[2006 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]] success due to being [[cup-tied]].

Fowler featured rarely in his final Liverpool season, making only six league starts. Bizarrely, all three of his League goals were penalties against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. Appearances in other competitions were more common due to Rafael Benitez's [[squad rotation system|squad rotation policy]]. On the [[25 October]] [[2006]] Fowler was named as Liverpool's [[captain (football)|captain]] for the first time since his return in a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] tie against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], scoring just before half-time in a 4–3 win.

On [[5 December]], Fowler scored his first two goals in the [[UEFA Champions League]] competition proper against [[Galatasaray S.K.|Galatasaray]] (he had previously scored during a qualifying tie some six years prior against [[FC Haka]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6210854.stm |title=Clockwatch: Champions League |accessdate=2007-02-24 |last=Cheese |first=Caroline |publisher=BBC Sport online }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/football/champions_league/1500956.stm |title=Liverpool stroll past FC Haka  |accessdate=2007-08-23 |publisher=BBC }}</ref> though Liverpool lost 3–2.

On [[1 May]] [[2007]] he was a substitute in the Champions League semi-final against Chelsea, brought on in the last few minutes of [[extra-time]]. He set up an attack for [[Dirk Kuyt]] but the shot went straight at the Chelsea goalkeeper. The match went into a penalty shoot-out that Liverpool won. Fowler was due to take the fifth and final spot-kick, but the game had already ended when Kuyt slotted home his winning penalty.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N155818070502-1501.htm |title=RAFA HAILS SPOT-KICK HERO ZENDEN   |accessdate=2007-05-02 |last= |first= date=2007-05-02 |publisher=liverpoolfc.tv }}</ref>

In what transpired to be his last appearance for the club, against Charlton Athletic on [[13 May]] [[2007]], Fowler was given the captain's armband one final time. He was substituted two minutes from the final whistle and given a standing ovation. The crowd still chanted his name as the match finished and applauded him for his years of service. He finished his second run as a Liverpool player with a [[UEFA Champions League]] runners up medal, although he was not named in either the starting eleven or the seven substitutes. He became a free agent on [[1 July]] [[2007]] having scored 183 goals in 369 appearances during his two spells at the club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/team/past_players/players/fowler2/index.htm |title=

===Cardiff City===
On [[21 July]] [[2007]] Fowler signed a two-year contract to play for Cardiff City.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/news/article2790995.ece |title= Ecclestone eyes Arsenal deal as Fowler joins Cardiff|accessdate=2007-08-23 |publisher=Independent }}</ref> He missed the season's opening fixtures due to a lack of fitness,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2007/08/13/sfgcar113.xml |title=Dave Jones rues Cardiff City's striker shortage |accessdate=2007-08-23 |publisher=Independent }}</ref> making his debut in a [[League Cup]] tie on [[28 August]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/6963490.stm |title=Cardiff 1-0 Leyton Orient |accessdate=2007-09-08 |publisher=BBC }}</ref> He scored his first two Cardiff goals on [[22 September]] [[2007]] against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], scoring with two headers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/6996433.stm |title=Cardiff 2-2 Preston |accessdate=2007-09-25 |publisher=BBC }}</ref> Fowler scored twice in his next game, a third round [[Carling Cup]] tie against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]], which Cardiff won 4&ndash;2.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/7008015.stm |title=West Brom 2-4 Cardiff |accessdate=2007-09-25 |publisher=BBC }}</ref> This led to a fourth round tie against Fowler's former club Liverpool, at [[Anfield]], but Cardiff were knocked out in a 2&ndash;1 defeat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/7017625.stm |title=Coventry to meet West Ham in cup |accessdate=2007-09-29 |publisher=BBC }}</ref>

In November, Fowler travelled to [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]] to see Dr. [[Hans-Wilhelm Müller-Wohlfarth]], a specialist sports injuries doctor, to try and resolve a recurring hip problem that had left him lacking fitness in early season fixtures for the Bluebirds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/7087020.stm |title=Fowler seeks to solve hip worry |accessdate=2007-11-10 |publisher=BBC }}</ref> The treatment involved taking around twenty-eight injections into his hip. He returned to full training in late November and made his comeback on [[15 December]] as a late substitute in a 1&ndash;0 defeat against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/footballnation/football-news/2007/11/30/fowler-targets-charlton-91466-20184340/ |title=Fowler targets Charlton |accessdate=2007-12-08 |publisher=South Wales Echo }}</ref> However he went on to suffer another injury blow just days later after a mistimed tackle in training from club captain [[Darren Purse]] left him with damaged ankle ligaments.<ref>"Terry Phillips A to Z of football, pg60" South Wales Echo Retrieved on [[2007-12-30]]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/footballnation/cardiff-city-fc/2007/12/21/robbie-fowler-in-fresh-injury-blow-91466-20276718/ |title=Robbie Fowler in fresh injury blow |accessdate=2007-12-22 |publisher=South Wales Echo }}</ref> Due to the new injury blow Cardiff and Fowler made plans for him to go to [[Colorado]], [[United States of America|U.S.A.]] to undergo keyhole surgery on the hip problem, which had plagued him in recent seasons, in the hope that it would finally resolve the problem.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/7163268.stm |title=Fowler facing hip operation in US |accessdate=2007-12-29 |publisher=BBC Sport }}</ref>

On [[17 January]], it was announced that Fowler could miss the rest of the [[Cardiff City F.C. season 2007-08|2007-08]] season for Cardiff after his hip operation revealed that the injury was worse than previously thought. Surgeons were forced to perform a micro-fracture in order for the hip to heal properly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/footballnation/cardiff-city-fc/2008/01/17/robbie-fowler-out-for-the-season-91466-20361123/ |title=Robbie Fowler out for season |accessdate=2008-01-17 |publisher=South Wales Echo }}</ref> Despite this, he attempted to make a comeback at the end of the season to play in the [[2008 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and was included in the 18-man match squad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/7380184.stm |title=Fowler in Cup final fitnes race |accessdate=2008-05-19 |publisher=BBC Sport }}</ref> However he did not feature in the game in anyway and thus did not receive a runners-up medal having not made an appearance in the competition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/7393770.stm |title=Portsmouth 1-0 Cardiff |accessdate=2008-05-19 |publisher=BBC Sport }}</ref>

Fowler was offered a new pay-as-you-play contract with Cardiff for the 2008/2009 season in May 2008 and was set to sign the contract before pulling out of a deal at the last minute after he received an offer of a trial at [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] from former [[England national football team|England]] colleague [[Paul Ince]], leaving Cardiff manager [[Dave Jones]] and chairman [[Peter Ridsdale]] furious after the club had assisted his rehabilitation throughout the summer. After training with Blackburn and appearing in a handful of friendlies he was offered a six-month deal by the club to last until January, but Fowler turned down the deal due to it being a shorter offer than the previous one he had rejected at Cardiff. After turning down the deal Fowler made a shock enquiry about returning to Cardiff but was firmly told "no thanks".<ref>[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/footballnation/football-news/2008/08/30/cardiff-city-reject-fowler-request-for-return-91466-21636375/ "Cardiff City reject Fowler request for return"] [[South Wales Echo]] Retrieved on [[30 August]], [[2008]]</ref>

==Outside football==
In association with [[Steve McManaman]], Fowler has invested in several racehorses through a company named ''The Macca and Growler Partnership'', most notably 2003 Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Celebration Chase
winner [[Seebald]].<ref>{{cite web |title=People in racing: Celebrities |work=British Horse Racing |url=http://www.britishhorseracing.com/goracing/racing/peopleinracing/celebrities/1.1.7.4.asp|accessmonthday=August 23 |accessyear=2007}}</ref> In 2005, Fowler was listed as one of the 1,000 wealthiest Britons by the ''[[Sunday Times Rich List]]''. Business interests including a large property portfolio have resulted in Fowler becoming the third wealthiest footballer in Britain.<ref>{{cite web |title=Beckham tops football's rich list |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6212696.stm|accessmonthday=December 6 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> This gave rise to the affectionate Liverpool chant, ''We all live in a Robbie Fowler house'', sung to the tune of [[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]].<ref name="Observer" /> 

On [[2 September]] [[2005]] he released 'Fowler: My Autobiography', about his time as a footballer and the issues surrounding him. Since his transfer to Liverpool he has updated it and included a section about his return to [[Anfield]]. Excerpts published in newspapers included criticism of the England management. 

Fowler married wife Kerrie on [[9 June]] [[2001]] in the town of [[Duns]] in [[Scotland]]. Together they have three daughters named Madison, Jaya, and Mackenzie,<ref>''Fowler: My Autobiography, p351</ref> with one son, Jacob.
