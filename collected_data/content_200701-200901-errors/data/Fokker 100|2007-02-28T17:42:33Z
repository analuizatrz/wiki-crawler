The '''Fokker F100''' is a medium size twin-[[turbofan]] [[regional airliner]] from the [[Fokker]] company.

Low operational costs and almost no competition in the 100-seat short-range class made it a best seller when it was introduced in the late 1980s, but improved models of the [[Boeing 737]] and [[Airbus A320|Airbus A319]] and [[Airbus A320#A318|A318]] affected sales and Fokker became insolvent. Production ended in 1997 with 283 airframes delivered. In August [[2006]] 229 Fokker F100 aircraft remained in airline service with 47 airlines around the world.<ref name="FI">[[Flight International]], 3-9 October 2006</ref>

==History==
The F100 design was announced in 1983 as an updated replacement for Fokker's popular, but outdated, [[Fokker F28|F28]] ''Fellowship'' design. The most noticeable difference was the much longer fuselage, which almost doubled the seating from 65 in the original F28 series to 107 in a three-by-two single-class arrangement. Fokker also introduced a redesigned wing for the F100, which they claimed was 30% more efficient in cruise. The engines were upgraded to the modern [[Rolls-Royce Tay (turbofan)|Rolls-Royce Tay]] [[turbofan]]s, while the cockpit was updated with an [[glass cockpit|all-glass instrumentation]] package. The F100 features fuselage-mounted engines similar to that of the [[Douglas DC-9]] family.

Two prototypes were built - the first, PH-MKH, flew for the first time on [[November 30]], [[1986]], and the second, PH-MKC, followed on [[February 25]], [[1987]]. The type certificate was awarded in November 1987. The first deliveries of the TAY620-15 powered versions started to [[Swissair]] in February 1988. [[American Airlines]] (75 planes ordered), [[TAM]] (50 planes) and [[US Air]] (40 planes) were major customers of the F100 and were powered by the more powerful TAY650-15.

By 1991, Fokker had produced 70 units and had orders for a total of more than 230. An extended range version with additional fuel tanks in the wings was introduced in 1993, and a quick-change passenger/freighter version in 1994, the F100QC. A shorter version was introduced in 1993 as a direct replacement for the earlier [[Fokker F28|F28]], known as the [[Fokker 70]], which removed 4.70 m of the fuselage and reduced seating to 80. Studies on the 130 seat '''F130''' and the '''Fokker 100QC''' (freighter) did not reach further stages of development. A '''Fokker 100EJ''' (Executive Jet) has been introduced in 2003 as a conversion from used Fokker 100 aircraft.

Although the design was a success in the marketplace, Fokker continued to lose massive amounts of money due to mismanagement. Eventually their parent company, [[Daimler Benz Aerospace]], shut them down. Fokker collapsed in 1996 and wound up production in early 1997. There had been some discussion about the company being purchased by [[Bombardier]], but the plans fell through. 

An [[Amsterdam]]-based group, '''Rekkof Restart''' (Rekkof is Fokker spelled backwards) negotiated to re-open the [[Fokker 70]] and F100 lines in 1999, but the deal never completed. 

Like any number of designs, the F70/F100 was being increasingly squeezed from below by stretched versions of the Bombardier and Embraer [[regional jet]]s, which also killed off plans for the [[Fairchild JET]] and an unnamed design from [[ATR]].

==Crashes and Incidents==
*On [[5 March]] [[1993]], a [[Palair Macedonian Airlines]] F100  crashed near [[Skopje]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]],in climb, due to icing. Four of the six crew and 77 of the 91 passengers were killed.
*In [[1996]], a problem in a [[Reverse thrust|thrust reverser]] caused an F100 of the Brazilian airline [[TAM Linhas Aéreas|TAM]] to crash in [[São Paulo]] shortly after take-off, killing 95 and 4 on the ground.
*In 1997, an explosion caused by a person trying to commit suicide fatally blew a passenger out of a TAM Fokker 100 during flight.  
*In 2001, two cabin windows shattered on a TAM Fokker 100 due to an engine breakup, and the depressurization killed one of the 82 passengers on board.
*On August 8, 2006, a front door of a TAM flight came off a few minutes after takeoff at the [[Congonhas International Airport]], in [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]], [[Brazil]].  The cabin had not yet been pressurized and the pilot was able to land back at Congonhas.  The door fell approximately 450 meters (1,470 feet) onto the roof of a supermarket, causing no major damage.
*On January 25, 2007, a [[Régional|Régional Compagnie Aérienne Européenne]] F100 (F-GMPG) overran the runway on an aborted takeoff. Initial reports stated the bird ingestion was the cause of the abort. One person killed on the ground as the aircraft hit a truck.
