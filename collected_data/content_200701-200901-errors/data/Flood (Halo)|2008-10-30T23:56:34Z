The '''Flood''' are fictional [[parasite|parasitic]] [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] life forms in [[Bungie]]'s ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' video game series. They are introduced in ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' as a second enemy faction alongside the [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]], and return in ''[[Halo 2]]''  and ''[[Halo 3]]'' to fill the same role. The Flood are driven by a desire to infect any sentient life they encounter, and are depicted as such a threat that the ancient [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunners]] are forced to kill themselves and all other sentient life nearly 100,000 years before the beginning of ''Halo'' in an effort to starve the Flood to death.

The Flood's design and fiction was spearheaded by Bungie artist Robert McLees, who utilized unused concepts from the earlier Bungie game ''[[Marathon 2]]''. The ringworld [[Halo (megastructure)|Halo]] was stripped of many of its large creatures to make the Flood's appearance more startling. Bungie environment artist Vic DeLeon spent six months of pre-production time refining the Flood's fleshy aesthetic and designing the organic interiors of Flood-based space ships for ''Halo&nbsp;3''. 

The player's discovery of the Flood in ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' is a major plot twist, and was one of the surprises reviewers noted positively upon release. The Flood's return in ''Halo&nbsp;2'' and ''Halo&nbsp;3'' was less enthusiastically praised. Reaction to the Flood has varied over the years; while publications such as ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' found the Flood too derivative and a cliché element of science fiction, ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Magazine]]'' and ''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World Magazine]]'' rated them among the greatest villains of all time.

The Flood were added early in the development of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', before the game had made its jump from the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] platform to the [[Microsoft Xbox]].

At one point, the ringworld Halo featured dinosaur-like terrestrial creatures, but due to gameplay constraints, these were dropped. An additional consideration was that Bungie felt the presence of other native species would dilute the impact and surprise of the Flood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=prexboxhistory040904 |title=One Million Years B.X. |author=Bungie|date=2006-02-10 |publisher=[[Bungie.net]]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060210224125/http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=prexboxhistory040904 |archivedate=2006-02-10 }}</ref> Commenting upon the inception of the Flood, Bungie staff member Chris Butcher noted that "the idea behind the Flood as the forgotten peril that ended a galaxy-spanning empire is a pretty fundamental tenet of good sci-fi.

For ''Halo 3'', it was decided a new visual language for the Flood was needed. The task of developing the new Flood forms, organic Flood terrain, and other miscellaneous changes fell to Vic DeLeon, Bungie's Senior Environment Artist.<ref name="deleon-flood">{{cite web|author=DeLeon, Vic|date=2008-05-28|url=http://www.bungie.net/Inside/publications.aspx|title=Bungie Publications: Halo 3 Flood Alien Level Autopsy|publisher=[[Bungie]]|accessdate=2008-07-12}}</ref> Flood-infested structures were designed as angular to counterbalance Flood biomass, as well as provide surfaces for the game's artificial intelligence to exploit and move on. New additions were designed to be multi-purpose; exploding "growth pods" that spew Flood forms were added to the game to adjust pacing, provide instant action, and add to the visuals. [[Endoscopy|Endoscopic]] pictures provided further inspiration.<ref name="deleon-flood"/> Bungie used ''Halo 3''{{'}}s improved capacity for graphics to make a host's sudden transformation into Flood form more dramatic; two different character models and skeletons were fused and swapped in real-time.<ref>{{cite journal|author=McEachern, Martin|year=2007|month=December|title=Making Halo 3 Shine|journal=Computer Graphics World|volume=30|issue=12|pages=pp. 18–25}}</ref>

The Flood make their surprise appearance more than halfway through ''Halo: Combat Evolved''<nowikI>'</nowiki>s campaign, during the mission "343 Guilty Spark".

The emergence of the Flood on  the ringworld [[Halo (megastructure)#Installation 04|Halo]] prompts Halo's resident artificial intelligence [[343 Guilty Spark]] to enlist the help of the Master Chief in activating Halo's defenses and preventing a Flood outbreak.<ref>'''343 Guilty Spark''': Greetings.

The 2006 comic ''[[The Halo Graphic Novel]]'' expands upon the Flood's release from Halo in two stories. The first, ''Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor'', takes place at the same time as the Master Chief hunts for Keyes during ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. The Flood manage to pilot a Covenant dropship off Halo, and crash-land the vessel in the hangar of a Covenant agricultural ship, ''Infinite Succor''. Successfully assimilating most of the Covenant and wildlife aboard the ship, the Flood are stopped by a Covenant strike team led by [[Characters of Halo#Rtas 'Vadumee|Rtas 'Vadumee]], who sets the ship on a course into the nearby sun.<ref>{{cite book |last= Hammock|first= Lee|title=The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor|year= 2006|publisher= Marvel Comics|isbn=0785123725 |pages=}}</ref> The second story, ''Breaking Quarantine'', details the escape of Sergeant [[Characters in the Halo series#Avery Johnson|Avery Johnson]] from the clutches of the Flood, immediately after Keyes' squad is overrun during ''Halo''.

Despite the positive acclaim in ''Halo'', the response to the presence of the Flood in ''Halo&nbsp;2'' and ''Halo&nbsp;3'' was mixed.

Lee Hammock, writer of the ''[[Halo Graphic Novel]]'' story ''The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor'', described the basis of the story as a way to showcase the true danger of the Flood as an intelligent menace, rather than something the player encounters and shoots.
