The '''Battle of Farrukhabad''' took place on [[November 14]] [[1804]].
In [[Battle of Farrukhabad|Farrukhabad]], Lord Lake was a mute spectator, watching Yashwantrao Holkar proceeding towards Deeg; he didn't dare attack Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar. The Governor General was disappointed by this conduct of Lord Lake, and he wrote to him about his disappointment.

Lord Lake attacked Deeg on [[13 December]] 1804 ([[Battle of Bharatpur]]); the army of Holkar and Jat resisted successfully and reached the Bharatpur Durg. Lord Lake attacked [[Bharatpur]] on [[3 January]] 1805, along with General Manson, Colonel Marey, Colonel Don, Colonel Berne, Major General Jones, General Smith, Colonel Jetland, Setan, and others. The war lasted for three months in Bharatpur and was compared with the [[Mahabharata]] war. Many poems on this war were written, praising Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar, and there are many other poems praising Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar. It is said that Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar cut off the nose of 300 English soldiers. To keep the Indian kings divided, the British declared that they would distribute the territory of Holkars amongst its Indian friends. Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar had become famous throughout India, due to his bravery; however, [[Amir Khan Pindari]] and Bhawani Shankar Khatri betrayed Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar. The British gave the Jahagir of Tonk to Amir Khan Pindari, and a Mahal and a Jahagir in Delhi were given to Bhawani Shankar Khatri. Bhawani Shankar Khatriâ€™s Haweli, situated in Delhi, is even today referred to as Namak Haram ki Haweli (Traitors House). Daulatrao Scindia decided to help Holkar, but was prevented from doing so by the ill advice of [[Kamal Nayan Munshi]]. If Daulatrao had gone to help Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar, they would have crushed the British army. Ranjit Singh was disappointed, as Daulatrao Scindia did not come for their help; but Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar was not affected, and continued to communicate with rest of the kings of India.

[[Sir P.E. Roberts]] states that surprisingly, the Jat King Ranjit Singh signed a treaty with the British on [[17 April]] 1805, when they had nearly won the war. Due to this, Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar had to leave Bharatpur.


(*[[Yashwantrao Holkar]] was in [[Farrukhabad]] on 16 November 1804, but he had defeated Major Frazer in [[Doab]] and he was on his way to [[Deeg]].)
