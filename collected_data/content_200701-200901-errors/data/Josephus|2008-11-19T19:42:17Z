==Life==
[[Image:Ancient Galilee.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The [[Galilee]], site of Josephus' governorship, in [[Late Antiquity|late antiquity]].]]

Josephus, who introduced himself in [[Greek language|Greek]] as "Iosepos (Ιώσηπος), son of Matthias, an ethnic [[Jew]], a priest from [[Jerusalem]]",<ref>[[The Wars of the Jews|Jewish War]]'' I.3</ref> fought the Romans in the [[First Jewish-Roman War]] of 66-73 as a Jewish military leader in [[Galilee]]. After the Jewish garrison of [[Jotapata|Yodfat]] was taken under siege, the Romans invaded, killing thousands; the survivors committed suicide.

According to Josephus, however, in circumstances that are somewhat unclear, Jospehus found himself trapped in a cave with forty of his companions. The Romans asked him to surrender once they discovered where he was, but his companions refused to allow this. He therefore suggested a method of collective suicide: they draw lots and kill each other, one by one, counting to every third person. The sole survivor of this process was Josephus (this method as a mathematical problem is referred to as the [[Josephus problem]], or ''Roman Roulette'' <ref> Cf. this example, [http://acm.uva.es/p/v1/130.html ''Roman Roulette''].</ref>) Josephus and one of his soldiers then surrendered to the Roman forces invading Galilee in July 67 and became prisoners. The Roman forces were led by Flavius [[Vespasian]] and his son [[Titus]], both subsequently [[Roman emperor]]s. In 69, Josephus was released (cf. ''War'' IV.622-629) and according to Josephus's own account, he appears to have played a role as a negotiator with the defenders during the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Siege of Jerusalem]] in 70.

In 71, he arrived in Rome in the entourage of Titus, becoming a Roman citizen and client of the ruling [[Flavian|Flavian dynasty]] (hence he is often referred to as Flavius Josephus - see below). In addition to Roman citizenship he was granted accommodation in conquered [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]], and a decent, if not extravagant, pension. It was while in Rome, and under Flavian patronage, that Josephus wrote all of his known works. Although he only ever calls himself "Josephus", he appears to have taken the Roman [[praenomen]] Titus and [[nomen]] Flavius from his patrons.<ref>Attested by the third century Church theologian Origen (''Comm. Matt.'' 10.17).</ref> This was standard practice for 'new' Roman citizens.

Josephus's first wife perished, together with his parents, in Jerusalem during the siege and [[Vespasian]] arranged for him to marry a Jewish woman who had been captured. This woman left Josephus, and around 70, he married a Jewish woman from [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]] by whom he had three male children. Only one, Flavius Hyrcanus, survived childhood. Josephus later divorced his third wife and around 75, married his fourth wife, a Jewish woman from Crete, member of a distinguished family. This last marriage produced two sons, Flavius Justus and Flavius Simonides Agrippa.

Josephus's life is beset with ambiguity. For his critics, he never satisfactorily explained his actions during the Jewish war — why he failed to commit suicide in Galilee in 67 with some of his compatriots, and why, after his capture, he accepted patronage from the Romans. Historian [[E. Mary Smallwood]] wrote:

<blockquote>(Josephus) was conceited, not only about his own learning but also about the opinions held of him as commander both by the Galileans and by the Romans; he was guilty of shocking duplicity at [[Jotapata]], saving himself by sacrifice of his companions; he was too naive to see how he stood condemned out of his own mouth for his conduct, and yet no words were too harsh when he was blackening his opponents; and after landing, however involuntarily, in the Roman camp, he turned his captivity to his own advantage, and benefitted for the rest of his days from his change of side.<ref>Josephus, Flavius, ''The Jewish War'', tr. G.A. Williamson, introduction by E. Mary Smallwood. New York, Penguin, 1981, p. 24</ref></blockquote>

However, his critics ignore the fact that [[Simon Bar Giora]] and [[John of Giscala]], both extreme zealots and great opponents of Josephus, who stayed in Jerusalem and led the war against Rome in its final stage, in a moment of truth, preferred life over suicide and humbly surrendered to the Romans. Those who have viewed Josephus as a traitor and informer have also questioned his credibility as a historian — dismissing his works as Roman propaganda or as a personal [[apologetics|apologetic]], aimed at rehabilitating his reputation in history. More recently, commentators have reassessed previously-held views of Josephus. As [[P.J. O'Rourke]] quipped:

<blockquote>Reason dictates we should hate this man. But it's hard to get angry at Josephus. What, after all, did he do? A few soldiers were tricked into suicide. Some demoralizing claptrap was shouted at a beleaguered army. A wife was distressed... all of which pale by comparison to what the good men did. For it was the loyal, the idealistic and the brave who did the real damage. The devout and patriotic leaders of Jerusalem sacrificed tens of thousands of lives to the cause of freedom. Vespasian and Titus sacrificed tens of thousands of more to the cause of civil order. Even [[Agrippa II]], the Roman client king of Judea who did all he could to prevent the war, ended by supervising the destruction of half a dozen of his cities and the sale of their inhabitants into slavery. How much better for everyone if all the principal figures of the region had been slithering filth like Josephus.<ref>O'Rourke 104.</ref></blockquote>

Josephus was unquestionably an important apologist in the Roman world for the Jewish people and culture, particularly at a time of conflict and tension. He always remained, in his own eyes, a loyal and law-observant Jew. He went out of his way both to commend Judaism to educated [[Gentile]]s, and to insist on its compatibility with cultured [[Graeco-Roman]] thought. He constantly contended for the antiquity of [[Jewish culture]], presenting its people as civilised, devout and philosophical. [[Eusebius]] reports that a statue of Josephus was erected in Rome.<ref>''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' 3.9.2</ref>

==Significance to scholarship==
[[Image:Josephus.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A fanciful representation of Flavius Josephus, in an engraving in [[William Whiston]]'s translation of his works]]

The works of Josephus provide crucial information about the First Jewish-Roman War and are also important literary source material for understanding the context of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] and post-[[Second Temple]] Judaism. Josephan scholarship in the 19th and early 20th century became focused on Josephus' relationship to the sect of the [[Pharisees]]. He was consistently portrayed as a member of the sect, but nevertheless viewed as a villainous traitor to his own nation - a view which became known as the classical concept of Josephus. In the mid 20th century, this view was challenged by a new generation of scholars who formulated the modern concept of Josephus, still considering him a Pharisee but restoring his reputation in part as patriot and a historian of some standing. Scholarship post-1990 sought to move scholarly perceptions forward by demonstrating that Josephus was not a Pharisee but an orthodox Aristocrat-Priest who became part of the Temple Establishment as a matter of deference, and not willing association (cf. Steve Mason 1991).

Josephus includes information about individuals, groups, customs and geographical places. His writings provide a significant, extra-Biblical account of the post-Exilic period of the [[Maccabees]], the [[Hasmonean]] dynasty, and the rise of [[Herod the Great]]. He makes references to the [[Sadducee]]s, Jewish [[Kohen Gadol|High Priests]] of the time, Pharisees and [[Essenes]], the [[Herod's Temple|Herodian Temple]], [[Quirinius]]' census and the [[Zealots]], and to such figures as [[Pontius Pilate]], [[Herod the Great]], [[Agrippa I]] and [[Agrippa II]], [[John the Baptist]], [[Josephus on Jesus#Reference to Jesus as brother of James .28xx 9.1.29|James the brother of Jesus]], and a [[Josephus on Jesus#Testimonium Flavianum|disputed reference]] to [[Jesus]]. He is an important source for studies of immediate post-Temple Judaism (and, thus, the context of [[early Christianity]]).

A careful reading of Josephus' writings allowed [[Ehud Netzer]], an archaeologist from Hebrew University, to discover the location of Herod's Tomb, after a search of 35 years - above aqueducts and pools, at a flattened, desert site, halfway up the hill to the [[Herodium]], 12 kilometers south of Jerusalem - exactly where it should have been, according to Josephus's writings.{{fact|date=November 2008}}

For many years, the works of Josephus were printed only in an imperfect Latin translation from the original Greek. It was only in 1544 that a version of the Greek text was made available, edited by the Dutch humanist [[Arnoldus Arlenius]]. The first English translation, by Thomas Lodge, appeared in 1602, with subsequent editions appearing throughout the 17th century. However, the 1544 Greek edition formed the basis of the 1732 English translation by [[William Whiston]] which achieved enormous popularity in the English speaking world (and which is currently available online for free download by [[Project Gutenberg]]). Later editions of the Greek text include that of [[Benedikt Niese]], who made a detailed examination of all the available manuscripts, mainly from France and Spain. This was the version used by H. St J. Thackeray for the [[Loeb Classical Library]] edition widely used today.

===The Jewish War===
{{main|The Wars of the Jews}}

His first work in Rome was an account of the Jewish War, addressed to certain "upper barbarians" – usually thought to be the Jewish community in [[Mesopotamia]] – in his "paternal tongue" (''War'' I.3), arguably the Western [[Aramaic language]]. He then wrote a seven-volume account in [[Greek language|Greek]] known to us as the ''[[The Wars of the Jews|Jewish War]]'' ([[Latin]] ''Bellum Iudaicum''). It starts with the period of the [[Maccabees]] and concludes with accounts of the fall of [[Jerusalem]], the Roman victory celebrations in Rome, the mopping-up operations, Roman military operations elsewhere in the Empire and the uprising in [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]]. Together with the account in his ''Life'' of some of the same events, it also provides the reader with an overview of Josephus' own part in the events since his return to Jerusalem from a brief visit to Rome in the early 60s (''Life'' 13-17).

Rome cannot have been an easy place for a Jew to live, in the wake of the suppression of the Jewish revolt. Josephus would have witnessed the marches of Titus' triumphant legions leading their Jewish captives, and carrying treasures from the despoiled [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. He would have experienced the popular presentation of the Jews as a bellicose and xenophobic people.

It was against this background that Josephus wrote his ''War'', and although this work has often been dismissed as pro-Roman propaganda (hardly a surprising view, given the source of his patronage), he claims to be writing to counter anti-Judean accounts. He disputes the claim that the Jews served a defeated God, and were naturally hostile to Roman civilization. Rather, he blames the Jewish War on what he calls "unrepresentative and [[Zealots|over-zealous fanatics]]" among the Jews, who led the masses away from their traditional aristocratic leaders (like himself), with disastrous results. Josephus also blames some of the Roman governors of Judea, but these he represents as atypical: corrupt and incompetent administrators. Thus, according to Josephus, the traditional Jew was, should be, and can be, a loyal and peace-loving citizen. Jews can, and historically have, accepted Rome's hegemony precisely because their faith declares that God himself gives empires their power.

===Jewish Antiquities===
{{main|Antiquities of the Jews}}

The next work by Josephus is his twenty-one volume ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', completed during the last year of the reign of the Emperor Flavius [[Domitian]] (between 1.9.93 and 14.3.94, cf. AJ X.267). He claims that interested persons have pressed him to give a fuller account of the Jewish culture and constitution. Here, in expounding Jewish history, law and custom, he is entering into many philosophical debates current in Rome at that time. Again he offers an ''apologia'' for the antiquity and universal significance of the Jewish people.

Beginning with the [[Creation according to Genesis|creation according to Genesis]], he outlines Jewish history. [[Abraham]] taught [[science]] to the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], who in turn taught the [[Greeks]]. [[Moses]] set up a senatorial priestly aristocracy, which, like that of Rome, resisted monarchy. The great figures of the [[Bible|biblical stories]] are presented as ideal philosopher-leaders. There is again an autobiographical Appendix defending Josephus' own conduct at the end of the war when he cooperated with the Roman forces.

===Against Apion===
{{main|Against Apion}}

Josephus' ''[[Against Apion]]'' is a two-volume defence of Judaism as [[classical antiquity|classical]] [[religion]] and [[philosophy]], stressing its antiquity, as opposed to what Josephus claimed was the relatively more recent tradition of the Greeks. Some anti-Judean allegations ascribed by Josephus to the Greek writer [[Apion]], and myths accredited to [[Manetho]] are also addressed.
