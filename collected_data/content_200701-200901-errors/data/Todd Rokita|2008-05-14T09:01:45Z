'''Theodore E. Rokita''', known as '''Todd Rokita''' (born [[1970]]), is the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Secretary of State]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Indiana]]. When Rokita was elected to office in [[2002]] at the age of thirty-two, he became at the time the youngest Secretary of State in the [[United States]]. He had held no prior public office.

Rokita was reelected in [[2006]], having defeated the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] Joseph R. "Joe" Pearson of [[Hartford City, Indiana|Hartford City]]. Rokita received 835,912 votes to Pearson's 746,460. Another 54,381 ballots were cast for the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] candidate, Michael R. "Mike" Kole of Fishers. Pearson is a [[nephew]] of former [[Indiana State Senate|State Senator]] [[Wayne Townsend]], the Democratic [[gubernatorial]] nominee in [[1984]] and a long-time advocate of [[liberal]] causes in Indiana.

Rokita was elected by his peers nationally to serve on the nine-member federal Executive Board of the Election Assistance Commission. The Commission is charged by law to address election reform issues on a nation-wide basis. Rokita has testified about Indiana's voting reform efforts before the United States Congress.

Rokita is a named defendant in the Hoosier state's voter identification case which goes before the U.S. Supreme Court on January 9, 2008; the combined cases of ''Crawford v. Marion County Election Board'' (07-21) and ''Indiana Democratic Party v. Rokita'' (07-25) involve the Indiana voting requirement law that is said to be among the most stringent in the nation. A decision is expected in summer 2008. Rokita has received national acclaim for defending the right of Hoosiers to have their votes count as the passage of photo identification legislation in 2005 has reduced the potential for vote fraud and voter disenfranchisement.

Rokita also serves as Indiana's chief securities fraud investigator. Rokita's office has closed hundreds of enforcement actions against violators of securities law, uncovered investor fraud scams, and helped secure numerous felony convictions and millions of dollars in restitution and fines. 

As Secretary of State, Rokita visits each of Indiana's ninety-two counties at least once per year. Rokita was recently named as one of the "40 under 40" by the ''Indianapolis Business Journal''.

He was first general counsel for the secretary of state, then deputy secretary of state, and thereafter secretary of state.

Rokita is active in the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), and after serving as the elected treasurer, he is currently the President for the 2007-2008 term.

Rokita has also served as Chair of NASS' New Millennium Young Voters Summit of 2004, chair of the standing Voter Participation Committee and vice chair of the Securities Regulation Committee.

==Controversy==
In [[April]] [[2007]], Rokita was discussing how 90 percent of [[African Americans]] vote Democratic, after which he asked, "How can that be? Ninety to 10. Who's the master and who's the slave in that relationship? How can that be healthy?" Four days after making those remarks, he apologized.
