[[Image:Golden Film Liever verliefd 2.jpg|thumb|250px|The Golden Film trophy for ''[[Love to Love (film)|Love to Love]]'' (2003)]]

The '''Golden Film''' ({{lang-nl|'''Gouden Film'''}}) is a [[film]] [[award]] recognising domestic [[box office]] achievements in the [[Netherlands]]. The Golden Film is awarded to films from the Netherlands once they have sold {{nowrap|100,000 tickets}}. The award is an initiative by the [[Netherlands Film Festival]] and the [[Netherlands Film Fund]] to increase media attention for [[Netherlands|Dutch]] films. Since its introduction in [[2001]], the public's interest in Dutch films in the Netherlands has increased. The Golden Film has been awarded to [[List of films that received the Golden Film|{{:List of films that received the Golden Film}}&nbsp;films]].

Dutch newspapers report about films receiving the Golden Film. Recipients consider the Golden Film to be an award for success. Critics have said that films cannot be considered successful if they have sold only the number of tickets needed to receive the award.

==Award==
A Golden Film is [[award]]ed to a [[film]] from the [[Netherlands]] once it has sold {{nowrap|100,000 [[Movie theater|cinema]]}} tickets in the Netherlands during the original cinema circulation.<ref name="film-fund-press-release">{{cite press release

The Golden Film is an initiative by the [[Netherlands Film Festival]] and the government-subsidized [[Netherlands Film Fund]], with the support of [[Film Investors Netherlands]], to increase the public's awareness of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] films in the Netherlands. The Golden Film recognises box office achievements to encourage positive publicity for a film after the initial media attention surrounding its release has begun to wane. The award is similar to the Dutch music industry's Golden Record, that is awarded after selling 40,000&nbsp;singles, 35,000&nbsp;popular music albums, or 15,000&nbsp;classical music albums.<ref name="feest">{{cite web

The Netherlands Film Festival and the Netherlands Film Fund announced the Golden Film on [[September 4]], [[2001]] as an award for films from the Netherlands that had been seen by a paying audience of, at that time, 75,000 or more. The [[Platinum Film]] was introduced at the same time, for films with paying audiences of 200,000 or more. The first Golden Film was awarded on [[September 28]], [[2001]] to ''[[I Love You Too (film)|I Love You Too]]'' (2001),<ref name="iloveyoutoo">{{cite web

Within 18 months of the award's introduction, the public's interest in [[Netherlands|Dutch]] films in the Netherlands had increased. The audience for Dutch films as a percentage of the total cinema audience in the Netherlands was 5.5% in 1999 and 5.9% in 2000. After the introduction of the award, audiences increased to 9.5% in 2001 and to 10.5% in 2002.<ref name="statistics"/>

In 2003, the criterion for the award was changed in an effort to further stimulate the Dutch film industry. Films released after [[January 1]], [[2003]] had to reach paying audiences of 100,000 to qualify for the Golden Film and 400,000 for the Platinum Film.<ref name="film-fund-press-release"/> All films that had received a Golden Film before 2003 would also have received a Golden Film under the new criterion.<ref name="report2001">{{cite web

Only ''[[Full Moon Party (film)|Full Moon Party]]'' (2002) and ''[[Black Book (film)|Black Book]]'' (2006) have reached the criterion, for respectively 75,000 and {{nowrap|100,000 visitors}}, during their opening weekends.<ref>{{cite web

Recipients consider the Golden Film to be an award for success. Director [[Martin Koolhoven]] said, when ''[[Schnitzel Paradise]]'' (2005) received the award, that he did not expect his film to be such a success. ''Schnitzel Paradise'' was his first commercially successful film.<ref>{{cite web

Critics of the award have said that films which have sold only 75,000 or {{nowrap|100,000 tickets}} cannot be considered successful. In 2002, film journalist Ronald Ockhuysen said about the Golden Film:
<blockquote class="templatequote"><div>A good idea – in itself. (...) A positive signal towards the people. But it is doubtful whether the masses pick up the signal. 75,000&nbsp;visitors makes a meagre, a poor appearance. Especially for films solely made for the masses, like Full Moon Party. Johan Nijenhuis, the director of Full Moon Party, has admitted outright that he considers only 300,000&nbsp;visitors a failure.{{ref label|ockhuysen_|ii|ii}}<ref name="feest"/></div></blockquote> Ockhuysen also wrote that the Golden Film is a "child of our time" because it tries to reduce the value of a film to its commercial success, and it is supporting films that already have large publicity budgets instead of smaller and more vulnerable productions.<ref name="feest"/> Film producer [[Rob Houwer]] has said that he believes the Golden Film is the prize for a [[failure|flop]]. In 2005, when the criterion for the award had already been increased from 75,000 to 100,000&nbsp;visitors, he said in an interview:
<blockquote class="templatequote"><div>It is really nothing at all. A failure. It starts to be something for a producer when 350,000 or more cinema tickets are sold. It is incomprehensible why there are media reporting about this award. Why does everybody accept this nonsense?{{ref label|houwer_|iii|iii}}<ref name="nonsense">{{cite web

Since the introduction of the Golden Film, the only Dutch film produced by Rob Houwer was ''[[Het Woeden der Gehele Wereld (film)|Het Woeden der Gehele Wereld]]'' (2006), which sold only 4,000 cinema tickets.<ref name="statistics"/>

<div class="references-small">
:*{{note label|anp_|i|i}} The phrase "the magical threshold of 100,000" is a translation of the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] phrase "de magische grens van 100.000" that was used by the [[Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau|ANP]].<ref name="bontekoe"/>

Alleen is het twijfelachtig of het grote publiek dat signaal wel oppikt. 75 Duizend bezoekers heeft iets schraals, iets armoedigs. Zeker als een film, zoals Volle Maan, louter en alleen is gemaakt voor een massapubliek. Johan Nijenhuis, regisseur van Volle Maan, heeft ruiterlijk toegegeven dat hij 300 duizend bezoekers als een mislukking beschouwt."<ref name="feest"/>
