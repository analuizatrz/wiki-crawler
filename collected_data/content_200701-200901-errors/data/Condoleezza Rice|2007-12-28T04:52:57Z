<!--Please See naming conventions at WP:MOSBIO, do not add details like "Dr." or "Phd"-->'''Condoleezza Rice''' (born [[November 14]] [[1954]]) is the 66th [[United States Secretary of State]], and the second in the administration of [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] to hold the office. Rice is the first black woman, second black person (after [[Colin Powell]], who served before her from 2001 to 2005), and second woman (after [[Madeleine Albright]] who served from 1997 to 2001) to serve as Secretary of State. Rice was President Bush's [[United States National Security Advisor|National Security Advisor]] during his first term, but before joining the Bush administration, she was a [[Professor]] of [[political science]] at [[Stanford University]] where she served as [[Provost (education)|Provost]] from 1993 to 1999. During the administration of [[George H.W. Bush]], Rice also served as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Eastern Europe|East European]] Affairs Advisor during the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union|dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and [[German reunification]].

When beginning as Secretary of State, Rice pioneered a policy of [[Transformational Diplomacy]], with a focus on democracy in the greater Middle East. Her emphasis on supporting democratically elected governments faced challenges as Hamas captured a popular majority in Palestine yet supported Islamist terror, and influential countries including Saudi Arabia and Egypt maintained non-democratic systems with U.S. support. Her policies and strong diplomatic style gained her recognition as a powerful leader by mainstream media.{{Fact|date=October 2007}} She chairs the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]]'s board of directors.<ref>http://www.millennium.az:8101/mcaccount.htm</ref>

==Early life==
Rice was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]], and grew up in the neighborhood of [[Titusville, Birmingham, Alabama|Titusville]]. She is the only child of [[Presbyterian]] minister Reverend [[John Wesley Rice]], Jr., and wife, [[Angelena Rice|Angelena Ray]]. Reverend Rice was a guidance counselor at Ullman High School and minister of Westminster Presbyterian Church, which had been founded by his father. Angelena was a science, music, and oratory teacher at Ullman.<ref name=notablebio>[http://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Ow-Sh/Rice-Condoleezza.html "Condoleezza Rice Notable Biography"], ''Encyclopedia of World Biography'' (Thomson-Gale), online posting, ''notablebiographies.com'', accessed [[March 26]], [[2007]].</ref>
====Discrimination====
Condoleezza (whose name is derived from the [[Italian language|Italian]] musical expression, ''Con dolcezza'', which means "with sweetness"<ref name=ice>Felix, Antonia [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2092-1367314,00.html Condi: The girl who cracked the ice]. Times Online. [[November 21]], [[2004]]. Retrieved [[February 21]], [[2006]].</ref>) experienced firsthand the injustices of Birmingham's discriminatory laws and attitudes. She was instructed to walk proudly in public and to use the facilities at home rather than subject herself to the indignity of "colored" facilities in town. As Rice recalls of her parents and their peers, "they refused to allow the limits and injustices of their time to limit our horizons."<ref>"Birmingham native Condoleezza Rice confirmation vote delayed as next U.S. Secretary of State" ''Birmingham Times'' [[January 20]], [[2005]].</ref>

However, Rice recalls various times in which she suffered discrimination on account of her race, which included being relegated to a storage room at a department store instead of a regular dressing room, being barred from going to the circus or the local amusement park, being denied hotel rooms, and even being given bad food at restaurants.<ref name=ice /> Also, while Condoleezza was mostly kept by her parents from areas where she might face discrimination, she was very aware of the civil rights struggle and the problems of [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] Birmingham. A neighbor, Juliemma Smith, described how "[Condi] used to call me and say things like, 'Did you see what [[Bull Connor]] did today?' She was just a little girl and she did that all the time. I would have to read the newspaper thoroughly because I wouldn’t know what she was going to talk about."<ref name=ice /> Rice herself said of the segregation era: "Those terrible events burned into my consciousness. I missed many days at my segregated school because of the frequent bomb threats."<ref name=ice />

During the violent days of the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|Civil Rights Movement]], Reverend Rice armed himself and kept guard over the house while Condoleezza practiced the piano inside. According to J.L. Chestnut, Reverend Rice called local civil rights leader [[Fred Shuttlesworth]] and his followers "uneducated, misguided Negroes."<ref>[http://www.blackcommentator.com/160/160_condi_civil_rights_disdain.html Chestnut 2005].

While the Rices supported the goals of the civil rights movement, they did not agree with the idea of putting their child in harm's way.<ref name=ice />

Rice was eight when her schoolmate Denise McNair, aged 11, was killed in the bombing of the primarily black [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|Sixteenth Street Baptist Church]] by [[white supremacy|white supremacists]] on [[September 15]], [[1963]]. Rice has commented upon that moment in her life: {{Quotation|I remember the bombing of that Sunday School at 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham in 1963. I did not see it happen, but I heard it happen, and I felt it happen, just a few blocks away at my father’s church. It is a sound that I will never forget, that will forever reverberate in my ears. That bomb took the lives of four young girls, including my friend and playmate, Denise McNair. The crime was calculated to suck the hope out of young lives, bury their aspirations.

====Early education====
[[Image:Condi as a College Student.jpg|thumb|right|Condoleezza Rice as an undergraduate student at the University of Denver]]

====High school and university education====
In 1967, the family moved to [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]. She attended [[St. Mary's Academy (Englewood)|St. Mary's Academy]], a private all-girls Catholic high school in [[Cherry Hills Village, Colorado|Cherry Hills Village]], [[Colorado]]. After studying piano at the [[Aspen Music Festival and School]], Rice enrolled at the [[University of Denver]], where her father both served as an assistant dean and taught a class called "The Black Experience in America." Dean John Rice opposed institutional racism, government oppression, and the [[Vietnam War]].

Rice attended a course on international politics taught by [[Josef Korbel]], the father of future Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]]. This experience sparked her interest in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[international relations]] and made her call Korbel "one of the most central figures in my life."<ref>Michael Dobbs.

Rice graduated from St. Mary's Academy in 1970. In 1974, at age 19, Rice earned her B.A. in [[political science]], [[Phi Beta Kappa]], from the University of Denver. In 1975, she obtained her [[Master's Degree]] in [[political science]] from the [[University of Notre Dame]]. She first worked in the [[State Department]] in 1977, during the [[Carter administration]], as an intern in the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. In 1981, at the age of 26, she received her [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Political Science from the Graduate School of International Studies at Denver. Her dissertation along with some of her earliest publications, centered on military policy and politics in Czechoslovakia.<ref>{{cite book|author=Condoleezza Rice|title=The Politics of Client Command: Party-Military Relations in Czechoslovakia, 1948–1975.

===Early political views===

Rice was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] until 1982 when she changed her political affiliation to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] after growing averse to former President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s foreign policy.<ref>Maki Becker.

However, despite her party switch, Rice served as foreign policy advisor to the presidential campaign of Democratic U.S. Senator [[Gary Hart]] of [[Colorado]] during the [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984 primaries]].<ref>Deborah Solomon.

==Academic career==
[[Image:condi rice.jpg|thumb|right|Condoleezza Rice during a 2005 interview on ITV in London]]
Rice was hired by [[Stanford University]] as an [[Assistant Professor]] in [[political science|Political Science]] (1981–1987). She was granted [[tenure]] and promoted, first to [[Associate Professor]] (1987–1993), and then to [[Provost (education)|Provost]], the chief budget and academic officer of the university (1993–1999), and full [[Professor]] (1993–present).<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/2001/10/15/crice.html Condoleezza Rice profile]. [[Forbes]], [[October 18]], [[2001]].</ref> Rice was the first female, first minority, and youngest Provost at Stanford.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2002/black.history/stories/13.rice/index.html CNN Black History article on Dr. Rice.]</ref> She was also named a [[Senior Fellow]] of the [[Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies|Institute for International Studies]], and a Senior Fellow (by courtesy) of the [[Hoover Institution]]. She was a specialist on the former [[Soviet Union]] and gave lectures on the subject for the Berkeley-Stanford joint program led by [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] Professor [[George Breslauer]] in the mid-1980s.

====Provost promotion====
Former Stanford President [[Gerhard Casper]] said the university was "most fortunate in persuading someone of Professor Rice's exceptional talents and proven ability in critical situations to take on this task. Everything she has done, she has done well; I have every confidence that she will continue that record as provost."<ref>http://news-service.stanford.edu/pr/93/930519Arc3267.html</ref> Rice’s Stanford appointment was considered, by Casper, an effort to address concerns about alleged bias at Stanford University. Casper told the New Yorker in 2002 that it “would be disingenuous for me to say that the fact that she was a woman, the fact that she was black … weren't in my mind."

====Balancing school budget====
As Stanford's Provost, Rice was responsible for managing the university's multi-billion dollar budget. The school at that time was running a deficit of $20 million. When Rice took office, she promised that the budget deficit would be balanced within "two years." Coit Blacker, Stanford's deputy director of the Institute for International Studies, said there "was a sort of conventional wisdom that said it couldn't be done ... that [the deficit] was structural, that we just had to live with it." Two years later, Rice announced that the deficit been eliminated and the university was holding a record surplus of over $14.5 million.<ref>James Robinson [http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/1999/june9/rice-69.html Velvet-glove forcefulness: Six years of provostial challenges and achievements]. Stanford Report Online, [[June 9]], [[1999]]. Retrieved [[July 10]], [[2006]].</ref>

====Special interest issues====
Rice drew protests when, as provost, she departed from the practice of applying affirmative action to tenure decisions and unsuccessfully sought to consolidate the university's ethnic community centers.<ref>Barabak, Mark.

Los Angeles Times.</ref>

==Private sector==
Rice headed Chevron's committee on public policy until she resigned on [[January 15]], [[2001]], to become [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] to President [[George W. Bush]]. Chevron honored Rice by naming an [[Petroleum tanker|oil tanker]] ''Condoleezza Rice'' after her, but controversy led to its being renamed ''Altair Voyager.''<ref>Carla Marinucci.

She also served on the [[board of directors]] for the [[Carnegie Corporation]], the [[Charles Schwab Corporation]], the [[Chevron Corporation]], [[Hewlett Packard]], the [[Rand Corporation]], the [[Transamerica Corporation]], and other organizations.

In 1992 Rice founded the Center for New Generation, an after-school program created to raise the high school graduation numbers of [[East Palo Alto]] and eastern [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], California.<ref>http://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/show_story.php?id=5083</ref>

==Early political career==
In 1986, while an international affairs fellow of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], Rice served as Special Assistant to the Director of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]].

From 1989 through March 1991 (the period of the fall of [[Berlin Wall]] and the final days of the [[Soviet Union]]), she served in President [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W. Bush's]] administration as Director, and then Senior Director, of Soviet and East European Affairs in the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], and a Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. In this position, Rice helped develop Bush's and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[James Baker]]'s policies in favor of [[German reunification]]. She impressed Bush, who later introduced her to Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] as the one who "tells me everything I know about the Soviet Union."<ref>Steve Kettmann, [http://dir.salon.com/politics2000/feature/2000/03/20/rice/index.html "Bush's secret weapon"] ''[[Salon.com]] [[March 20]], [[2000]]. Retrieved [[21 February]], [[2006]]</ref>

In 1991, Rice returned to her teaching position at Stanford, although she continued to serve as a consultant on the former Soviet Bloc for numerous clients in both the public and private sectors. Late that year, [[California Governor]] [[Pete Wilson]] appointed her to a bipartisan committee that had been formed to draw new state legislative and congressional districts in the state.

In 1997, she sat on the Federal Advisory Committee on Gender-Integrated Training in the Military.

During George W. Bush's [[2000 U.S. Presidential election]] campaign, Rice took a one-year leave of absence from [[Stanford University]] to help work as his foreign policy advisor. The group of advisors she led called itself [[The Vulcans]] in honor of the monumental [[Vulcan statue]], which sits on a hill overlooking her hometown of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]]. Rice would later go on to give a [[wikisource:Remarks by Condoleezza Rice at the 2000 Republican National Convention|noteworthy speech]] at the [[2000 Republican National Convention]]. The speech asserted that “…America's armed forces are not a global police force. They are not the world's 911.”<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/elections/ricetext080100.htm Text: Condoleezza Rice at the Republican National Convention: On Politics.] [[August 1]], [[2000]].

On [[December 17]], [[2000]], Rice was picked to serve as [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] and stepped down from her position at Stanford. She was the first woman to occupy the post. Rice earned the nickname of “Warrior Princess,” reflecting strong nerve and delicate manners.<ref name=forbes>[http://www.forbes.com/lists/2005/11/MTNG.html #1 Condoleezza Rice Secretary of state U.S. November 2005]. Retrieved [[April 17]], [[2007]].</ref>

During the summer of 2001, Rice met with [[CIA]] Director [[George Tenet]] on an almost daily basis to discuss the possibilities and prevention of terrorist attacks on American targets. Notably, on [[July 10]], [[2001]], Rice met with Tenet in what he referred to as an "emergency meeting"<ref>New York Times [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/02/washington/03ricecnd.html Records Show Tenet Briefed Rice]. Retrieved [[October 3]], [[2006]]</ref> held at the White House at Tenet's request to brief Rice and the NSC staff about the potential threat of an [[al Qaeda]] attack. Rice responded by asking Tenet to give a presentation on the matter to Secretary Rumsfeld and (now-former) [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]].<ref>McClatchy Washington Bureau[http://www.realcities.com/mld/krwashington/15662785.htm Rumsfeld, Ashcroft received warning of al Qaida attack before 9/11].

When asked about the meeting in 2006, Rice asserted she did not recall the specific meeting, commenting that she had met ''repeatedly'' with Tenet that summer about terrorist threats. Moreover, she stated that it was "incomprehensible” to her that she ignored terrorist threats two months before the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]].<ref>New York Times [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/02/washington/03ricecnd.html Records Show Tenet Briefed Rice].

Rice was an outspoken proponent of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. After [[Iraq]] delivered its declaration of [[weapons of mass destruction]] to the [[United Nations]] on [[December 8]], [[2002]], Rice wrote an [[editorial]] for [[The New York Times]] entitled ''Why We Know Iraq Is Lying''.<ref>Condoleezza Rice.

In March 2004, Rice declined to testify before the [[National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States]] (the [[9/11 Commission]]). The [[White House]] claimed [[executive privilege]] under constitutional [[separation of powers]] and cited past tradition. Under pressure, Bush agreed to allow her to testify<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/04/08/rice.transcript/ Transcript of Rice's 9/11 commission statement] [[CNN]] Retrieved [[January 16]], [[2007]].</ref> so long as it did not create a precedent of Presidential staff being required to appear before [[United States Congress]] when so requested. Her appearance before the commission on [[April 8]], [[2004]], was accepted by the Bush administration in part because she was not appearing directly before Congress. She thus became the first sitting National Security Advisor to testify on matters of policy. In April 2007, Rice rejected, on grounds of executive privilege, a House subpoena regarding the prewar claim that Iraq sought yellowcake uranium from Niger.<ref>Lee, Mathew.

Leading up to the [[2004 U.S. Presidential election]], Rice became the first National Security Advisor to campaign for an incumbent president. She stated that while: "Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with the actual attacks on America, Saddam Hussein's Iraq was a part of the [[Middle East]] that was festering and unstable, [and] was part of the circumstances that created the problem on September 11."<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/22/rice.speech.ap/ Rice defends decision to go to war in Iraq].

On [[January 18]], [[2003]], the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that Rice was involved in crafting Bush's position on race-based preferences. Rice has stated that "while race-neutral means are preferable," race can be taken into account as "one factor among others" in university admissions policies.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/01/17/rice.action/index.html Rice says race can be 'one factor' in considering admissions]. [[CNN]], [[January 18]], [[2003]]. Retrieved [[February 21]], [[2006]].</ref>

In a [[January 10]], 2003 interview with CNN's [[Wolf Blitzer]], Rice made headlines by stating regarding Iraqi [[WMD]]: "The problem here is that there will always be some uncertainty about how quickly he can acquire nuclear weapons. But we don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud."<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/01/10/wbr.smoking.gun/ Search for the smoking gun]. [[CNN]], [[January 10]], [[2003]].

After the invasion, when Iraq turned out to have no WMD capability, critics called Rice's claims a "hoax," "deception" and "demagogic scare tactic."<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/10/06/iraq.wmd.report/] Report: No WMD stockpiles in Iraq</ref><ref>[http://www.afterdowningstreet.org/?q=node/1069]

Rice indicated “It was information based on old reporting.”<ref>[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB116/testimony.htm Excerpts from April 8, 2004 Testimony of Dr. Condoleezza Rice Before the 9/11 Commission Pertaining to The President's Daily Brief of August 6, 2001], Retrieved March 1, 2007</ref> Sean Wilentz of Salon magazine suggested that the PDB contained current information based on continuing investigations, including that Bin Laden wanted to “bring the fighting to America".<ref> [http://dir.salon.com/story/opinion/feature/2004/04/13/rice/index.html Don't know much about history], Retrieved March 1, 2007.</ref>

==Secretary of State (2005–present)==

On [[November 16]], [[2004]], Bush nominated Rice to be [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. On [[January 26]], 2005, the Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 85-13. The negative votes, the most cast against any nomination for Secretary of State since 1825, came from Senators who, according to Boxer, wanted "to hold Dr. Rice and the Bush administration accountable for their failures in Iraq and in the war on terrorism." Their reasoning was that Rice had acted irresponsibly in equating Hussein's regime with [[Islamism|Islamist]] terrorism and some could not accept her previous record. Senator [[Robert Byrd]] voted against Rice’s appointment, indicating that she “has asserted that the President holds far more of the war power than the Constitution grants him.”<ref> Byrd, Senator Robert [http://byrd.senate.gov/speeches/byrd_speeches_2005_january/byrd_speeches_2005_january_lis/byrd_speeches_2005_january_lis_0.html] Standing for the Founding Principles of the Republic: Voting No on the Nomination of Dr. Rice as Secretary of State Published January 25, 2005.

Rice stated, that she and others who grew up in Alabama during the height of Parks' activism might not have realized her impact on their lives at the time, "but I can honestly say that without Mrs. Parks, I probably would not be standing here today as secretary of state."<ref>Ecumenical News International.

As of [[December 10]], [[2007]] Secretary Rice has visited 66 countries with a total 698,591 miles and 1478.05  hours (61.59 days) of time.<ref>http://www.state.gov/secretary/trvl/</ref>

On [[October 1]], [[2007]], Rice told children (at New York's Public School No. 154, the Harriet Tubman Learning Center) that she would not run for president, slept for 6 1/2 hours a night and was not afraid of war zones. Asked how it felt "''to be a lady with such a powerful job''", she said: "''Sometimes you don't feel all that powerful''." Rangel teasingly suggested Rice aim for the [[White House]].<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSN0132855820071001 Reuters, Rice questioned about her sleep, fears and dreams]</ref>

===Major initiatives===
As [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], Rice has championed the expansion of democratic governments. Rice stated that 9/11 was rooted in “oppression and despair” and so, the U.S. must advance democratic reform and support basic rights throughout the greater Middle East.<ref name=wilson /> Rice has also reformed and restructured the department, as well as U.S. diplomacy as a whole. "[[Transformational Diplomacy]]" is the goal that Rice describes as "work[ing] with our many partners around the world ... [and] build[ing] and sustain[ing] democratic, well-governed states that will respond to the needs of their people and conduct themselves responsibly in the international system."<ref name=TransDip>Office of the Spokesman. [http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2006/59339.htm Transformational Diplomacy]. [[January 18]], [[2006]]. [http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2006/59306.htm Georgetown University address]. [[January 18]], [[2006]].</ref>

Rice's Transformational Diplomacy involves five core elements:
* Relocating American diplomats to the places in the world where they are needed most, such as [[China]], [[India]], [[Brazil]], [[Egypt]], [[Nigeria]], [[Indonesia]], [[South Africa]], and [[Lebanon]].
* Requiring diplomats to serve some time in hardship locations such as [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Sudan]], and [[Angola]]; gain expertise in at least two regions; and become fluent in two foreign languages, such as [[Mandarin Chinese|Chinese]], [[Arabic (language)|Arabic]], or [[Urdu]].
* Focusing on regional solutions to problems like [[terrorism]], [[drug trafficking]], and diseases.
* Working with other countries on a bilateral basis to help them build a stronger infrastructure, and decreasing foreign nations' dependence on American hand-outs and assistance.
* Creating a high-level position, [[Director of Foreign Assistance]], to oversee U.S. foreign aid, thus de-fragmenting U.S. foreign assistance.

Rice said that these moves were needed to help "maintain security, fight poverty, and make democratic reforms" in these countries and would help improve foreign nations' [[legal]], [[economic]], [[healthcare]], and [[educational]] systems.<ref name=TransDip /><ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/18/AR2006011801937.html Diplomats Will Be Shifted to Hot Spots]. [[19 January]] [[2006]].</ref>

Another aspect of Transformational Diplomacy is the emphasis on finding regional solutions. Rice also pressed for finding transnational solutions as well, stating that "in the 21st century, geographic regions are growing ever more integrated economically, politically and culturally. This creates new opportunities but it also presents new challenges, especially from transnational threats like terrorism and weapons proliferation and drug smuggling and trafficking in persons and disease."<ref name=TransDip />
[[Image:Rice Transformational Diplomacy Speech.jpg|thumb|right|Rice unveils her plan for restructuring [[United States|American]] [[American foreign policy|foreign policy]], which she calls "[[Transformational Diplomacy]]," during a [[January 18]], [[2006]] speech at [[Georgetown University]]]]
Another aspect of the emphasis on regional solutions is the implementation of small, agile, "rapid-response" teams to tackle problems like disease, instead of the traditional approach of calling on experts in an [[embassy]]. Rice explained that this means moving diplomats out of the "back rooms of foreign ministries" and putting more effort into "localizing" the State Department's diplomatic posture in foreign nations. The Secretary emphasized the need for diplomats to move into the largely unreached "bustling new population centers" and to spread out "more widely across countries" in order to become more familiar with local issues and people.<ref name=TransDip />

Rice restructured U.S. foreign assistance, naming [[Randall L. Tobias]], an AIDS relief expert, as administrator of [[USAID]] (U.S. Agency for International Development). Tobias, as a deputy secretary of state, had the job of focusing foreign assistance efforts and de-fragmenting the disparate aid offices to improve effectiveness and efficiency.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/18/AR2006011801937.html Diplomats Will Be Shifted to Hot Spots]. [[19 January]] [[2006]].</ref>

Rice says these initiatives are necessary because of the highly "extraordinary time" in which Americans live. She compares the moves to the historic initiatives taken after [[World War II]], which she claims helped stabilize Europe as it is known today. Rice states that her Transformational Diplomacy is not merely about "influencing" or "reporting on" governments, but "changing people's lives" through tackling the issues like AIDS, the education of women, and the defeat of violent extremism.<ref name=TransDip />

In early 2007, Rice indicated that State Department employees were ''volunteering in large numbers,'' yet Defense Secretary Gates expressed concerns regarding a request from Rice that military personnel fill jobs in Iraq that are the responsibility of the State Department.<ref> [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/20/world/middleeast/20military.html Text THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: DIPLOMATIC MEMO; You Want Me to Go Where?

===Regional issues===
====Gaza withdrawal====
Rice worked to persuade Israel to withdraw from Palestinian territories and free up [[commerce]] and [[travel]] between the two areas. During the summer of 2005, Rice encouraged Israeli leadership to withdraw from settlements in [[Gaza]] and the [[West Bank]]. Rice spent April 2005 raising support among Arab leaders.<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/burmese/archive/2005-04/2005-04-12-voa10.cfm Rice Conducts Telephone Diplomacy on Israel's Gaza Withdrawal Plans].

[[September 12]], [[2005]].</ref> Gaza is now under Palestinian control once again. However, Palestinians complained that they were not able to travel through border crossings in and out of Gaza, which had stifled commerce.<ref name=mediates />

====Border Crossings Deal====
[[Image:Rice Border Crossing Deal.jpg|thumb|right|left|Rice announces brokering of the deal to open Gaza border crossings after a sleepless 48-hour negotiation]]
In November 2005, Rice renegotiated an opening of the Gaza border crossings.<ref>[http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/11/14/90016.shtml Rice: Gaza Border-Crossings Deal 'In Sight']. [[November 14]], [[2005]].</ref> Secretary Rice extended her visit to Jerusalem for a mediation session [[November 14]], meeting alternately with Israel and Palestinian delegations. Rice negotiated differences between Israel and Palestine that included a proposed blacklist of Palestinians that had been detained by Israel and a concern that future violence would induce a renewed closure of the border crossings. By [[November 15]], Rice announced an agreement to open Gaza's borders, with a system of transportation between Gaza and the West Bank, defining operations for transporting cargo and people across the border and allowing Gaza to reopen its international airport and begin work on a seaport. This included the [[Rafah]] border crossing, Palestine's only land link to a country other than Israel. It also included monitoring of the crossings by officials from the [[European Union]].<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/15/AR2005111500144_2.html "Rice Negotiates Deal to Open Gaza Crossings"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[November 16]], [[2005]].</ref>

Gideon Levy, reporter for an Israeli newspaper, complained Rice had accomplished little: "in what was considered the "achievement" of the current visit, Israel also promised to open the Karni crossing. Karni will be open, one can assume, only slightly more than the "safe passage," which never opened following the previous futile visit."<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/771541.html The mystery of America] By Gideon Levy, Haaretz, Oct. 17, 2006</ref>

====Hamas, Palestinian elections====
[[Image:Palestine election map.PNG|thumb|right|Map showing electoral districts and areas of formal Palestinian control (green)]]
Rice pushed for peaceful, democratic elections in Palestine following the death of [[Yasser Arafat]]. Rice asserted that "there should be the ability of Palestinian people to participate in the elections" and claimed that democratic elections would represent "a key step in the process of building a peaceful, democratic Palestinian state." Rice, alluding to the U.S.-labeled terrorist organization [[Hamas]], stated that "there should be no place in the political process for groups or individuals who refuse to renounce terror and violence, recognize Israel's right to exist, and disarm," saying, "You cannot have one foot in politics and the other foot in terror."<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/uspolicy/archive/2006-01/2006-01-18-voa2.cfm "Rice on Palestinian Elections"], ''[[Voice of America]]'', [[January 18]], [[2006]], News.</ref>

Rice persuaded a reluctant Israel to allow Israeli Palestinians in [[East Jerusalem]] to vote in the Palestinian Authority elections. Israel allowed Palestinians in East Jerusalem to vote in the [[January 25]], [[2006]] parliamentary elections, while banning Hamas, which officially calls for Israel's destruction, from campaigning there. Rice lauded the turnout and congratulated President Abbas, while informing the victorious Hamas that it would "have to make some difficult choices," saying, "Those who win elections have an obligation to govern democratically. … It now inherits the obligations of a Palestinian government, authority, that go back now for more than a decade to recognize the right of Israel to exist, to renounce violence, to disarm militias, as is the case in the roadmap, and to find a peaceful solution in two states."<ref>[http://usinfo.state.gov/is/Archive/2006/Jan/31-340686.html "Rice Lauds Peaceful Palestinian Elections, Decries Terrorism"], ''usinfo.state.gov'', [[January 30]], [[2006]].</ref>

In response to the Hamas victory, Israel withheld funds belonging to the Palestinian Authority, and reinforced restrictions on movement in and out of the Gaza Strip and within the West Bank. Rice stated: “Clearly, [Hamas] cannot govern in a circumstance in which they cannot represent a responsible government before the international system.” Rice told her Israeli counterpart that “the economic boycott on the Hamas-led Palestinian government is effective and in the international community will continue to maintain the boycott.”<ref>Geoffrey Aronson, [http://www.dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=3460 "A Bush policy of 'Après moi, le deluge’"], ''Daily Star Egypt'', [[October 16]], [[2006]], retrieved [[March 15]], [[2007]].</ref>

George Soros faulted Rice for refusing to deal with Hamas. "[N]o progress is possible as long as the Bush administration and the Ehud Olmert government persist in their current position of refusing to recognize a unity government that includes Hamas. The recent meeting between Condoleezza Rice, Abbas, and Olmert turned into an empty formality," said Soros. This was playing into the hands of the hard-liners in Hamas, increasing the influence of Syria and Iran, and would escalate the fighting, Soros said.<ref>[[George Soros]], [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20030 "On Israel, America and AIPAC"], ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', [[April 12]], [[2007]].</ref>

Immediately following Hamas' victory in the elections, Rice attempted to garner international support in demanding that Hamas recognize Israel's right to exist. By April, Hamas officials appeared to publicly state that they are willing to work toward recognizing Israel. Under their terms, Israel would have to fully withdraw from disputed territories, including Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem.<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/254A8588-3089-495E-9D54-FE87479080DB.htm Hamas 'willing' to recognise Israel]. [[April 12]], [[2006]].</ref> Many saw this as a positive starting point for negotiations that would allow the "roadmap" process to continue. The statement was verified by Hamas leaders such as Mohammed Ghazal, a Hamas militia official, who stated that Hamas may be willing to amend its charter to recognize Israel, saying, "The charter is not the [[Quran]]." Ghazal went on to state that while he agreed with Hamas' positions, "we’re talking now about reality, about political solutions … The realities are different."<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9424469/ "Hamas: We could one day recognize Israel"], ''[[MSNBC]]'', [[September 21]], [[2005]].</ref>

====2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict====
[[Image:Rice Special Briefing on Mideast Peace.jpg|thumb|left|Rice delivers a special briefing on Middle East Peace in the State Department Briefing Room, July 21, 2006]]
In mid-July 2006, the Middle East peace process encountered a new obstacle on a different front when [[Hezbollah]] fighters from Lebanon launched rocket attacks into Israel and ambushed Israeli convoys, kidnapping two soldiers and killing three, sparking what has become known as the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. Rice immediately condemned the act, calling Hezbollah a "terrorist organization" and saying that the action "undermines regional stability and goes against the interests of both the Israeli and Lebanese people," specifically calling on [[Syria]] to "use its influence to support a positive outcome."<ref>[http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2006/68902.htm "Actions in Northern Israel and Southern Lebanon"], ''[[United States Department of State]]'', online posting, ''state.gov'', [[July 12]], [[2006]].</ref> That day, Rice was one of the first to speak directly to [[UN]] [[United Nations Secretary General|Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]], Lebanese Prime Minister [[Fouad Siniora]] and Israeli [[Israeli Foreign Minister|Foreign Minister]] [[Tzipi Livni]] concerning the incident. Israel initiated aerial bombardments against Lebanon on [[July 13]] and sent in land troops on [[July 23]] to take out rocket launching sites that were shelling Northern Israeli cities, as well as to look for and recover the two kidnapped Israeli soldiers.

During the conflict, Rice supported Israel's right to defend itself from Hezbollah attacks, she repeatedly cautioned Israel to be responsible in minimizing [[collateral damage]]. Before the major fighting began, Rice demanded that both Israel and Lebanon "act with restraint to resolve this incident peacefully and to protect innocent life and civilian infrastructure." She also continued to pressure Syria to take a more active positive role throughout the crisis, accusing Syria of "sheltering the people who have been perpetrating these acts" and calling on it "to act responsibly and stop the use of its territory for these kinds of activities[,] to bring all pressure on those that it is harbouring to stop this and to return these soldiers and to allow the situation to be de-escalated."<ref>[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L13880934.htm "U.S.'s Rice Urges Israel to Exercise Restraint"], online posting, ''alertnet.org'', [[July 13]], [[2006]], The News (newsdesk).</ref>

[[Image:Rice Annan and Siniora.jpg|thumb|right|Rice, former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, and Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi work to lay the foundation for Resolution 1701, which ultimately imposed a ceasefire on the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]]
When Rice arrived in the Middle East in July 2006, one of her first moves was an unannounced visit to Lebanese Prime Minister Siniora to praise Siniora's "courage and steadfastness" and show U.S. support for the Lebanese people.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/5209778.stm Rice holds key talks in Lebanon]. [[July 24]], [[2006]].</ref> Rice stated that the conflict was part of "the birth pangs of a new Middle East," stating that Israel, Lebanon, and the international community had to "be certain that we're pushing forward to the new Middle East not going back to the old one."<ref>[http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2006/69331.htm "Special Briefing on Travel to the Middle East and Europe"], [[United States Department of State]], online posting, ''state.gov'', [[July 21]], [[2006]].</ref>

At a time when progress appeared possible in the region, the Israeli military launched an airstrike on a suspected Hezbollah hideout in [[Qana]], Lebanon, that killed 20–60 civilians. The [[2006 Qana airstrike|airstrike]] seemed to sour support for Israel's endeavor and [[Lebanon]] cancelled a visit by Rice as a result.<ref>[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L30778296.htm Israel strike kills at least 54, Lebanon shuns Rice]. [[July 30]], [[2006]].</ref> While the tragedy was a setback in the negotiation process, it seemed to be a turning point for Israel, who, afterward, began taking a path toward a cease-fire. Before Rice left the region on [[July 27]], she was able to negotiate a 48-hour halt on Israeli air-raids.

[[Image:Rice and Annan.jpg|thumb|left|Rice appears with former UN Secretary General Annan to announce the successful passage of Resolution 1701, which imposed a ceasefire on the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]]
Rice returned to the Mideast on July 29, where the outlines of the ceasefire to come began to take shape. Rice demanded that the global community do what it could to ensure that the Mideast region would never again return to the "status quo ante." Rice saw the situation as an opportunity to create a new environment in which Israel and Lebanon could live in peace, and in which Lebanon could have full control over all its territories without Hezbollah acting as a "state within a state," being able to launch terrorist attacks on Israel. Building on the two resolutions that came out of the [[G8]] [[32nd G8 summit|Conference]] and the steps that had been taken at the conference in [[Rome]], [[Italy]] in late July, Rice worked with other leaders at the United Nations to pass [[UN Security Council Resolution 1701]] on [[August 11]], 2006, which sought to resolve the crisis. The ceasefire went into effect on [[August 14]]. The ceasefire that Rice helped broker provided for a full cessation of hostilities, a Lebanese-led international force to take the place of the Israeli forces, the disarmament of Hezbollah, full control of the Lebanese government to Lebanon, and an absence of paramilitary forces (including and implying Hezbollah) south of the [[Litani River]]; it also emphasizes the need for the immediate release of the two kidnapped Israeli soldiers. Rice lauded the outcome and expressed pleasure that the hostilities in the area had been brought to an end. Though there were sporadic, but small, spurts of violence after the ceasefire took effect, it has ultimately sustained, while international peacekeeping forces began to replace Israeli forces. On [[October 2]], [[2006]], the last Israeli forces were withdrawn, allowing the UN and the Lebanese military to take over.<ref>[http://www.metro.co.uk/home/article.html?in_article_id=20428&in_page_id=1 "Israel Leaves Lebanon to UN"], online posting, ''metro.co.uk'', [[July 24]], [[2006]].</ref>

===Egypt===
In February 2005, Rice abruptly postponed a visit to Egypt, reflecting displeasure at the jailing of a leading opposition figure, [[Ayman Nour]]. Nour, head of the liberal Tomorrow Party, was reported to have been brutally interrogated.<ref> Kessler, Glen [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54613-2005Feb25.html Rice Drops Plans for Visit to Egypt] Washington Post [[February 26]], [[2005]]; Retrieved [[March 15]], [[2007]]</ref> Nour was freed by Egyptian authorities in March 2005, and began a campaign for the Egyptian presidency.<ref>Daniel Williams, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A29477-2005Mar12.html "Egypt Frees An Aspiring Candidate Presidential Hopeful Is Released on Bail"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[March 13]], [[2005]]. Retrieved [[March 20]], [[2007]].</ref>

In June 2005, Rice addressed democracy in the Middle East at the American University in Cairo. She stated: “There are those who say that democracy leads to chaos, or conflict, or terror. In fact, the opposite is true. … Ladies and Gentlemen: Across the Middle East today, millions of citizens are voicing their aspirations for liberty and for democracy …demanding freedom for themselves and democracy for their countries. To these courageous men and women, I say today: All free nations will stand with you as you secure the blessings of your own liberty”<ref>Fred Kaplan, [http://www.slate.com/id/2157678/pagenum/2/ "Waking Up to Reality: Condi makes nice in the Middle East"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', [[January 16]], [[2007]].

Nour finished second in Egypt's presidential race, held in 2005. In December 2005, Egypt imprisoned Nour on forgery charges that were disputed by human-rights groups. In February 2006, Rice visited [[Hosni Mubarak]] yet never spoke Nour's name publicly. When asked about him at a news conference, she referred to his situation as one of Egypt's setbacks.

Rice has worked in the [[Middle East]], including [[Israel]], the [[Palestinian territories]], and its immediate neighbors, especially [[Lebanon]]. Rice has supported Israel, defended Israel's right to protect itself, and promoted the "[[roadmap for peace]]," which includes the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state. On [[August 29]], [[2006]], she stated that the Middle East "should be a Middle East in which there is a Palestinian state in which Palestinians can have their own aspirations met, one that is not corrupt, one that is democratic, [and] one in which there is only one authority."<ref>[http://www.state.gov/p/nea/rt/c2829.htm "Middle East Peace"], ''[[United States Department of State]]'', online posting, ''state.gov'', [[August 29]], [[2006]].</ref>

===Iran===
Though the U.S. does not hold formal [[diplomatic relations]] with [[Iran]], Rice has been quite entrenched in issues pertaining to Iran, especially in regards to its [[democracy|democratic]] progress and [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]] record, [[President of Iran|Iranian President]] [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s threatening statements toward [[Israel]], and its pursuit of [[nuclear technology]].

Rice criticized Iran's [[human rights]] record and democratic principles. On [[February 3]], [[2005]], Rice said the Iranian regime's treatment of its people is "something to be loathed." She also stated: "I don't think anybody thinks that the unelected mullahs who run that regime are a good thing for either the Iranian people or for the region."<ref>[http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=1401 Iran human rights record 'to be loathed' -- Rice]. Iran Focus. [[February 3]], [[2005]]. Retrieved [[July 11]], [[2006]].</ref>

In October 2005, Ahmadinejad stated that "Israel must be wiped off the map,"<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/15E6BF77-6F91-46EE-A4B5-A3CE0E9957EA.htm Ahmadinejad: Wipe Israel Off Map].

Retrieved [[July 11]], [[2006]].</ref> to which Rice responded: "When the president of one country says that another country should be wiped off the face of the map, in violation of all of the norms of the United Nations, where they sit together as members, it has to be taken seriously." Rice then went on to name Iran as "probably the world's most important state sponsor of terrorism," whose people live "without freedom and without the prospect of freedom because an unelected few are denying them that."<ref>[http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=4203 Rice denounces Iranian president's call for Israel to be 'wiped off the map'].

In February 2006, Rice addressed the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] and called for funding to aid democratic reform in Iran through television and radio [[broadcasting]], through helping pay for Iranians to study in America, and through supporting pro-democracy groups within the country.<ref>Anne Gearan.

Rice said that the Bush administration should not be blamed for trouble areas and said that the burden was on Hamas to change.<ref>Tully, Andrew.

In recent years, Iran has also begun to pursue nuclear technology through [[uranium enrichment]], which has been one of the most pertinent issues that Rice has dealt with during her tenure at the State Department. Iran maintains that its nuclear program only seeks to develop the capacity for peaceful civilian [[nuclear power]] generation.<ref name="gen2010">{{Cite web|url=http://www.iran-daily.com/1384/2419/pdf/i3.pdf|title=Nuclear Power Plants Will Generate 6,000MW by 2010|accessdate=2006-04-25|publisher=Iran Daily}}</ref> Rice, along with other nations, has contended that Iran's record of sponsoring terrorism and threatening the safety of other nations, along with its defiance of its treaty obligations, of the United Nations Security Council, and of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], have not proven Iran to be responsible enough to conduct uranium enrichment without outside supervision. Under Rice, the official State Department consensus on the matter is that "[t]he United States believes the Iranian people should enjoy the benefits of a truly peaceful program to use nuclear reactors to generate electric power ... [and] support[s] the Iranian people’s rights to develop nuclear energy peacefully, with proper international safeguards."<ref>[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/scp/2006/68109.htm Iran at a Crossroads: An Historic Opportunity for A Better Future]. U.S. State Department. [[June 20]], [[2006]].</ref>

On [[September 9]], [[2005]], Rice declared the refusal of Iran to halt its nuclear program unacceptable and called on [[Russia]], [[China]] and [[India]] to join in threatening [[United Nations]] sanctions, and on [[June 2]], [[2006]], a committee of the [[Big Five|five permanent members]] of the [[UN Security Council]] and [[Germany]], announced their plan to convince Iran to cease its nuclear activities. Rice represented the United States in the negotiation of the diplomatic initiative.<ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2041368,00.html World Powers Agree on Deal, Wait on Iran]. [[Deutsche Welle]]. [[June 2]], [[2006]]. Retrieved [[June 2]], [[2006]].</ref>

On [[February 14]], [[2006]], Iran restarted its uranium enrichment program despite calls from the international community not to do so. Iran's traditional foe, Iraq, offered no resistance because Iraq's leadership had been transformed to Shiite control. Rice responded by asserting that "[t]here is simply no peaceful rationale for the Iranian regime to resume uranium enrichment." Speaking on behalf of the United States and the [[European Union]], Rice said they were "gravely concerned by Iran's long history of hiding sensitive nuclear activities from the IAEA, in violation of its obligations, its refusal to cooperate with the IAEA's investigation, its rejection of diplomatic initiatives offered by the EU and Russia and now its dangerous defiance of the entire international community."<ref>[http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2006/59083.htm On-the-Record Briefing by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice]. U.S. State Department. [[January 12]] [[2006]].</ref> In May of 2006, Rice came up with a new approach for dealing with Iran: direct negotiation between Iran and the United States (alongside their European allies) and the possibility for "a package of economic incentives and some kind of longer-term relationship with the United States" in exchange for the suspension of uranium enrichment within Iran.<ref name=Diplo-Dancing>Hirsh, Michael.

[[June 12]], [[2006]]: 32.</ref> Iran responded by saying that it will "never give up its legitimate rights, so the American preconditions are just unacceptable."<ref name=Diplo-Dancing/>

On [[July 12]], 2006, Rice, along with the foreign ministers of China, [[France]], [[Germany]], Russia, the [[United Kingdom]], and the European Union, announced that, as a result of Iran's refusal to suspend their uranium enrichment program, they had agreed to seek a [[UN Security Council Resolution]] against Iran under Article 41 of Chapter VII of the [[UN Charter]].<ref>[http://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/68910.htm P5 + 1 Statement: Negotiations With Iran.] [[12 July]] [[2006]].</ref> Article 41 gives such a resolution the power to interrupt or sever Iran's economic, transportational, telecommunicative, and diplomatic relations.<ref>[http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/chapter7.htm CHAPTER VII: ACTION WITH RESPECT TO THREATS TO THE PEACE, BREACHES OF THE PEACE, AND ACTS OF AGGRESSION.] Retrieved [[12 July]] [[2006]].</ref>

Though the United States and Iran disagree on key issues, the State Department has offered aid to Iran on many different occasions.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} After a deadly earthquake struck the Iranian [[province]] of [[Lorestan]] in March of 2005, Rice offered humanitarian aid to the country during a visit to [[England]].

Most recently, a letter alluding to Iran which was addressed to [[U.S. Secretary of State]] Condoleezza Rice from the Head of Government of Puerto Rico, [[Aníbal Acevedo Vilá]], accused the United States of having deceived the [[United Nations]] and the [[international community]] in 1953, when it succeeded in having the Commonwealth of [[Puerto Rico]] recognized as a provisional decolonized status subject to continued monitoring; Acevedo-Vila claimed that it was ironic that this is the position taken by the Government of Iran and that the Governor of Puerto Rico may soon feel forced to publicly accept Iran's claims regarding the U.S. government's alleged-hypocritical position with regards to Puerto Rico's "colonial status".<ref> [http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B0BBF386D-F7D6-4870-9CF0-EC85014C0EC6%7D)&language=EN Prensa Latina, Nestor Rosa-Marbrell, November 20, 2007; last verified on December 1st, 2007]</ref><ref> [http://espanol.news.yahoo.com/s/19112007/54/eeuu-gobernador-pide-rice-enmiende-informe-estatus-pol-tico-p.html ''El Gobernador pide a Rice que enmiende el informe sobre el estatus político de P.Rico''; Yahoo News; November 19, 2007 - Last verified, December 1st, 2007.]</ref>

===Iraq===
In January 2000, Rice addressed Iraq in an article for ''Foreign Affairs'' magazine. “As history marches toward markets and democracy, some states have been left by the side of the road. Iraq is the prototype. Saddam Hussein's regime is isolated, his conventional military power has been severely weakened, his people live in poverty and terror, and he has no useful place in international politics. He is therefore determined to develop WMD. Nothing will change until Saddam is gone, so the United States must mobilize whatever resources it can, including support from his opposition, to remove him."<ref>Leopold, Jason [http://www.blackcommentator.com/197/197_iraq_and_911_leopold.html Iraq and 9/11: The Truth is Out] The Black Commentator [[September 14]], [[2006]] Retrieved [[March 18]], [[2007]]</ref>

In August 2003, Rice encouraged rejection of "condescending voices", who say that Africans and Middle Easterners are not interested in freedom and are "culturally just not ready for freedom or they just aren't ready for freedom's responsibility." She continued: "We've heard that [blacks aren't ready] argument before, and we, more than any, as a people, should be ready to reject it. The view was wrong in 1963 in Birmingham, and it is wrong in 2003 in Baghdad and in the rest of the Middle East."<ref>King, Colbert I.

In October 2003, Rice was named to run the ''Iraq Stabilization Group,'' to “quell violence in Iraq and Afghanistan and to speed the reconstruction of both countries.”<ref>[[David Sanger]], [http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F0061EF638580C758CDDA90994DB404482 "White House to Overhaul Iraq and Afghan Missions"], ''[[New York Times]]'', [[October 26]], [[2003]].

In August 2003, Rice compared experiences in Iraq to post-War Germany stating that “the road we traveled was very difficult. 1945 through 1947 was an especially challenging period. Germany was not immediately stable or prosperous. SS officers — called 'werewolves' — engaged in sabotage and attacked both coalition forces and those locals cooperating with them — much like today's Baathist and Fedayeen remnants." Daniel Benjamin responded, stating that in “practice, Werwolf amounted to next to nothing.”<ref>Daniel Benjamin, [http://www.slate.com/id/2087768/ " Condi's Phony History, Sorry, Dr. Rice, Postwar Germany Was Nothing like Iraq"], online posting, [[August 29]], [[2003]].

In June 2005, Rice stated: “And at each phase, more Iraqis are involved in this process. Sunni and Shia and Kurds and other Iraqis are concentrating politically on building a united Iraq. That is why I think the insurgency must think that its last days are eventually going to come because the Iraqis are turning to their politics to serve their future.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/48299.htm Interview on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos — Secretary Condoleezza Rice] [[June 19]], [[2005]].

In 2005, when asked how long U.S. troops will stay in Iraq, Rice said, "I don't want to speculate. I do know that we are making progress with what the Iraqis themselves are capable of doing. And as they are able to do certain tasks, as they are able to hold their own territory, they will not need us to do that." Rice further added, "I think that even to try and speculate on how many years from now there will be a certain number of American forces is not appropriate."<ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-10/20/content_3652362.htm "Rice Makes Clear US Objectives in Iraq]", ''xinhuanet.com'', [[October 20]], [[2005]].</ref> Rice stated: “I have no doubt that as the Iraqi security forces get better — and they are getting better and are holding territory, and they are doing the things with minimal help — we are going to be able to bring down the level of our forces.” "I have no doubt that that's going to happen in a reasonable time frame."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/11/washington/11TRANSCRIPT-BOXER.html?ex=1173589200&en=5bb00e41f89105d1&ei=5070 Transcript of Senator Barbara Boxer and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice], ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[January 11]], [[2007]], Retrieved [[March 9]], [[2007]].</ref>

Rice lauded Iraq's voter turnout and peaceful transition into a sovereign government in 2005, and compared the reconstruction of Iraq to that of Europe after [[World War II]]. Rice wrote:
{{Quotation|
"Iraq ... in the face of a horrific insurgency has held historic elections, drafted and ratified a new national charter, and will go to the polls again in coming days to elect a new constitutional government. At this time last year, such unprecedented progress seemed impossible. One day it will all seem to have been inevitable. This is the nature of extraordinary times, which former Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] understood well and described perfectly in his memoirs. 'The significance of events,' he wrote, 'was shrouded in ambiguity. We groped after interpretations of them, sometimes reversed lines of action based on earlier views, and hesitated long before grasping what now seems obvious.' When Acheson left office in 1953, he could not know the fate of the policies he helped to create. He certainly could never have predicted that nearly four decades later, war between Europe's major powers would be unthinkable, or that America and the world would be harvesting the fruits of his good decisions and managing the collapse of communism. But because leaders such as Acheson steered American statecraft with our principles when precedents for action were lacking, because they dealt with their world as it was but never believed they were powerless to change it for the better, the promise of democratic peace is now a reality in all of Europe and in much of Asia."<ref>Condoleezza Rice, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/09/AR2005120901711.html "The Promise of Democratic Peace"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[December 11]], [[2005]].</ref>}}

In 2006, Rice compared U.S. commitment in Iraq to the Civil War, indicating “I'm sure there are people who thought it was a mistake to fight the Civil War to its end and to insist that the emancipation of slaves would hold."

===North Korea===
[[Image:Rice in China.jpg|thumb|right|Rice, in a July, 2005 press conference, announces that North Korea has agreed to return to the Six Party Talks]]
Rice has focused international attention on North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Beginning in 2003, a series of talks featuring [[China]], [[North Korea]], [[South Korea]], the United States, [[Russia]], and [[Japan]], dubbed "The [[Six Party talks]]," have been aimed at denuclearization.

On [[February 10]] [[2005]], North Korea withdrew from the talks after [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush|Bush]]'s 2005 [[State of the Union Address]], in which he stated that North Korea's nuclear program must be dismantled and pledged to go on the offensive against tyranny in the world.<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/02/20050202-11.html State of the Union Address]. [[February 2]], [[2005]].</ref> North Korea complained that the United States harbored a "hostile policy" toward their country and stated that they were permanently withdrawing from the [[Six-party talks]].<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/09/AR2005070901136.html "N. Korea Agrees To Rejoin Talks"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[July 10]], [[2005]].</ref> In the following months, there was uncertainty over whether Rice could convince [[Kim Jong-Il]] to re-enter the negotiations, but in July 2005, North Korea announced that they had been convinced to return to the discussion.

After the first phase of the 5th round of talks, which took place [[November 9]]–11, 2005, North Korea suspended its participations in the negotiations because the United States would not unfreeze some of its financial assets in a [[Macau]] bank.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4905308.stm N Korea offers nuclear talks deal]. [[April 13]], [[2006]].</ref> Rice has consistently called for the regime to return to the talks. On [[May 1]], [[2006]], Rice stated that North Korea needs "to return expeditiously to the talks without preconditions, to dismantle its nuclear programs in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner, and to cease all illicit and proliferation activities."<ref>[http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2006/65523.htm "Joint Statement by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs Taro Aso, and Japanese Minister of State for Defense Fukushiro Nukaga"], [[United States Department of State]], online posting, ''state.gov'', [[May 1]], [[2006]].</ref>

On [[June 19]], [[2006]], matters with North Korea were further complicated when it finished fueling an intercontinental ballistic missile that the regime said it would test fire. North Korea had previously self-imposed a missile-firing moratorium, but threatened to launch the missile anyway. Rice stated that "it would be a very serious matter and indeed a provocative act" for the North to follow through on the act, and that if the North decided to do so, "it would be taken with utmost seriousness."<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,200036,00.html "U.S.: North Korea Readies Missile for Test"], ''[[FOX News]]'', [[June 19]], [[2006]].</ref>

On [[July 5]], [[2006]], [[North Korean missile test, 2006|North Korea test-fired seven rockets]], including the infamous [[Taepodong-2]],<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/07/05/korea.missile/index.html North Korea test-fires 7th missile]. [[July 5]], [[2006]].</ref> sparking international backlash. Rice, in a press conference held on the same day, stated that she couldn't even begin to try to judge what motivated the North Koreans to act in such a way. Rice felt that North Korea had "miscalculated that the international community would remain united [in their opposition to the missile test-firing]" and "whatever they thought they were doing, they've gotten a very strong reaction from the international community." Following the missile test, the [[United Nations Security Council]] held an emergency meeting and strongly condemned the actions, though no official sanctions resulted at the time.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2006/68577.htm "Remarks with Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Gul After Their Meeting"], [[United States Department of State]], online posting, ''state.gov'', [[July 5]], [[2006]].</ref>

Rice disputes North Korea's claim that the nuclear test was committed to deter America from invading, saying, "We shouldn't even allow them such an excuse. ... It's just not the case. ... [T]here is no intention to invade or attack them.

[[Image:Rice and Lavrov.jpg|thumb|left|Rice meets with Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergei Lavrov]] in [[Busan, South Korea]] to discuss North Korea]]
Rice has also repeatedly offered direct negotiations with North Korea in the context of the Six Party Talks, but she has held her ground in her decision not to hold bilateral talks with the dictatorship, stating, "We've been through bilateral talks with the North Koreans in the 1994 agreed framework. It didn't hold. ... The North Koreans cheated [by] pursuing another path to a nuclear weapon, the so-called 'highly [[enriched uranium]]' path. ... [I]f [Kim Jong-Il] wants a bilateral deal, it's because he doesn't want to face the pressure of other states [nearer to him] that have leverage. It's not because he wants a bilateral deal with the United States. He doesn't want to face the leverage of China or South Korea or others."<ref name=Blitzer101006/>

Following the nuclear test, Rice made numerous calls to foreign leaders to consolidate support for taking punitive action against North Korea. Rice was able to draw condemnations from even some of North Korea's closest defenders, including China, who admitted the test was "flagrant" and "brazen."<ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20061011.KOREAMAIN11/TPStory/TPInternational/Asia China backs punishing N.

On [[October 14]], [[2006]], Rice worked with allies to pass a UN Security Council resolution against North Korea that demanded North Korea destroy all of its nuclear weapons, imposed a ban on tanks, warships, combat aircraft and missiles in the country, imposed an embargo on some luxury items that government officials enjoy while the general populace starves, froze some of the country's weapons-related financial assets, and allows for inspections of North Korean cargo.<ref>[http://apnews.myway.com/article/20061014/D8KOI9DO0.html U.N.

But Nobel Laureate and cold-war nuclear strategist [[Thomas Schelling]] criticized Rice for organizing a punitive response, when she should have encouraged Taiwan, South Korea and Japan to reaffirm the [[Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty]].<ref>Michael Spence, [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117168425437912114.html "Mr. Counterintuition"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', [[February 17]], [[2007]].</ref>

While Rice consistently affirms that the United States will not [[preemptive war|preemptively invade]], attack, or topple the North Korean regime, she emphatically assured Japan during an [[October 18]], [[2006]], visit that "the United States has the will and the capability to meet the full range — and I underscore full range — of its deterrent and security commitments to Japan," which many have interpreted to mean that America would not hesitate to use its [[American military|military]] might should North Korea attack one of America's allies.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2006/74669.htm "Remarks With Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso After Their Meeting"], [[United States Department of State]], online posting, ''state.gov'', [[October 18]], [[2006]].</ref>

===Russia===
[[Image:Rice and Putin.jpg|thumb|left|Rice speaks with Russian President Vladimir Putin during an April 2005 trip to Russia]]
In April 2005, Rice went to [[Russia]] to meet President [[Vladimir Putin]]. On the plane trip over, she related comments critical of Russia's democratic progress to reporters. "Trends have not been positive on the democratic side," said Rice. "There have been some setbacks, but I do still think there is a considerable amount of individual freedom in Russia, which is important."<ref>[http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:3zfb-a4YWzsJ:www.heraldsun.news.com.au/printpage/0,5481,15032888,00.html+%22Rice+attacks+Russia+on+democracy%22&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=2&client=firefox-a "Rice Attacks Russia On Democracy"], ''[[Herald Sun]]'', [[21 April]], [[2005]] (cached Google version). Retrieved April 2005.</ref> In person Rice told [[Putin]]: "We see Russia as a partner in solving regional issues, like the [[Balkans]] or the Middle East."

In late 2005, there was a dispute between Russia and [[Ukraine]] after Russia decided to quadruple the price of energy being provided to the Ukrainian market<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4562952.stm "Russia-Ukraine Gas Row Heats Up"], [[BBC News]], [[December 27]] [[2005]].</ref> (making the price equal to that of the current market price). Rice subsequently criticised Russia's actions, accusing Russia of using its gas wealth as a political weapon. She called on Russia to behave as a responsible energy supplier and stated that the act did not show the international community "that it is now prepared to act … as an energy supplier in a responsible way." Rice insisted, "When you say you want to be a part of the international economy and you want to be a responsible actor in the international economy, then you play by its rules … I think that kind of behavior is going to continue to draw comment about the distance between Russian behavior and something like this and what would be expected of a responsible member of the [[G8]]."<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,180720,00.html "Rice: Russia Uses Energy Wealth as Political Weapon"], [[Fox News]], [[January 5]] [[2006]].</ref>

Though there was some question over whether or not Rice could convince Russia not to block the United States' move to refer Iran to the [[United Nations Security Council]] in early 2006 (because of Russia's [[economy|economic]] and diplomatic ties to Iran), [[Russian Foreign Minister]] [[Sergei Lavrov]] eventually called Rice to confirm that Russia had agreed to allow the move.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/11/AR2006011102124.html "Russia Won't Block U.S. on Iran"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[January 12]] [[2006]].</ref>

In February 2006, Rice described the United States' relationship with Russia as "very good," saying, "In general, I think we have very good relations with Russia. Probably the best relations that have been there for quite some time. We cooperate in the [[war on terror]]. We cooperate in a number of areas. Obviously we have some differences, too. But on the [[Iran]]ian situation, we've actually had very good cooperation with the Russians."

In February 2007, Putin criticized U.S. plans to expand European missile defenses. “Who needs the next step of what would be, in this case, an inevitable arms race?” Putin also characterized U.S. military action as illegitimate, indicating “''They bring us to the abyss of one conflict after another. 'Political solutions are becoming impossible.''<ref> [http://www.wakeupfromyourslumber.com/node/646 Speech at the 43rd Munich Conference on Security Policy 02/10/2007. Retrieved February 21, 2007.]</ref> Rice soon responded “"Everybody understands that with a growing Iranian missile threat, which is quite pronounced, that there need to be ways to deal with that problem and that we are talking about long lead times to be able to have a defensive counter to offensive-missile threats”<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/21/AR2007022100543.html "Rice Deplores Russian Comment On Missile Shield"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[February 21]], [[2007]].

===Africa===
Rice has worked to support and expand relations with [[Equatorial Guinea]], an oil-rich African nation. In April 2006, Rice welcomed dictator-President Obiang to a press conference and stated, “You are a good friend and we welcome you.” The welcome was extended 35 days after the State Department issued a report noting instances of “torture, arbitrary arrest, judicial corruption, child labor, forced labor, and ‘severe restrictions’ on freedoms of speech and press.”<ref>Silverstein, Ken.

===Venezuela===
[[Image:Rice at CARICOM.jpg|thumb|right|Rice discusses American-Venezuelan relations at the [[CARICOM]] Ministerials in March 2006]]
The [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] has been particularly critical of the leadership of [[Venezuela]]n President [[Hugo Chávez]], and brands the country an "outlaw country in the drug war."<ref>Jackson, Jesse [http://www.suntimes.com/news/jackson/72307,CST-EDT-jesse26.article Dilemma of horns: Stop calling people, or nations, the devil]. Chicago Sun-Times. [[September 26]], [[2006]].</ref> During Rice's confirmation hearings, she commented on Chávez: "We are very concerned about a democratically elected leader who governs in an illiberal way, and some of the steps he's taken against the media, against the opposition, I think are really very deeply troubling."

Venezuela actively campaigned for a non-permanent seat in the [[2006 United Nations Security Council election]]. Rice, however, directed a global lobbying campaign by U.S. envoys in foreign capitals, contending that Venezuela did not belong on the Security Council.<ref>Varner, Bill [http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&sid=aHbR19zyxptU&refer=news Chavez's Push for UN Council Seat Sets Up a Showdown With U.S.].

==Political positions==
====Terrorism====
Rice's policy as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] views counterterrorism as a matter of being preventative, and not merely punitive. In an interview that took place on [[December 18]], [[2005]], Rice stated: "We have to remember that in this war on terrorism, we're not talking about criminal activity where you can allow somebody to commit the crime and then you go back and you arrest them and you question them. If they succeed in committing their crime, then hundreds or indeed thousands of people die. That's why you have to prevent, and intelligence is the long pole in the tent in preventing attacks."<ref>U.S. State Department [http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/58232.htm Interview on Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace]. [[December 18]], [[2005]].</ref>

[[Image:Condoleezza Rice and Rangin Dadfar Spanta.jpg|thumb|left|Rice meets with Afghan Foreign Minister [[Rangin Dadfar Spanta|Spanta]] to discuss anti-terrorism efforts]]
Rice has also been a frequent critic of the intelligence community's inability to cooperate and share information, which she believes is an integral part of preventing terrorism. In 2000, one year after Osama bin Laden told Time “[h]ostility toward America is a religious duty,”<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,174550,00.html "Exclusive Interview: Conversation with Terror"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', [[January 11]], [[1999]]. Retrieved [[February 21]], [[2007]].</ref> and a year before the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]], Rice warned on [[WJR]][[Detroit]]: "You really have to get the intelligence agencies better organized to deal with the terrorist threat to the [[United States]] itself. One of the problems that we have is a kind of split responsibility, of course, between the [[CIA]] and foreign intelligence and the [[FBI]] and domestic intelligence." She then added: "There needs to be better cooperation because we don't want to wake up one day and find out that [[Osama bin Laden]] has been successful on our own territory."<ref>[http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2004/3/24/120740.shtml Rice Quotes Contradict Clarke Account]. NewsMax. [[March 24]], [[2004]].</ref>

Rice also has promoted the idea that counterterrorism involves not only confronting the governments and organizations that promote and condone terrorism, but also the ideologies that fuel terrorism. In a speech given on [[July 29]], [[2005]], Rice asserted that "[s]ecuring America from terrorist attack is more than a matter of law enforcement. We must also confront the ideology of hatred in foreign societies by supporting the universal hope of liberty and the inherent appeal of democracy."<ref>U.S. State Department [http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/50375.htm Remarks With Senator Richard Lugar on the U.S. Department of State and the Challenges of the 21st century]. [[July 29]], [[2005]].</ref>

In January 2005, during Bush's [[Inauguration Day|second inaugural ceremonies]], Rice first used the term "[[outposts of tyranny]]" to refer to countries felt to threaten world peace and human rights. This term has been called a descendant of Bush's phrase, "[[Axis of Evil]]," used to describe [[Iraq]], [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]]. She identified six such "outposts" in which she said the United States has a duty to foster freedom: [[Cuba]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Burma]] and [[Belarus]], as well as Iran and North Korea.

====Abortion====
Rice said "If you go back to 2000 when I helped the president in the campaign. I said that I was, in effect, kind of libertarian on this issue. And meaning by that, that I have been concerned about a government role in this issue. I am a strong proponent of parental choice -of parental notification. I am a strong proponent of a ban on late-term abortion. These are all things that I think unite people and I think that that's where we should be. I've called myself at times mildly pro-choice."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30282-2005Mar12.html Washington Post, March 2005]</ref> She would not want the federal government "forcing its views on one side or the other."<ref>[http://www.4condi.com/issuequotation.htm Washington Times, March 2005]</ref>

Rice said she believes President Bush "has been in exactly the right place" on abortion, "which is we have to respect the culture of life and we have to try and bring people to have respect for it and make this as rare a circumstance as possible" However, she added that she has been "concerned about a government role" but has "tended to agree with those who do not favor federal funding for abortion, because I believe that those who hold a strong moral view on the other side should not be forced to fund" the procedure.<ref>[http://www.4condi.com/issuequotation.htm Washington Times, March 2005]</ref>

==Public perception and criticisms==
[[Image:Rice at Boston College.jpg|thumb|left|Rice makes an appearance at Boston College, where she is greeted by Father [[William P. Leahy|William Leahy]]]]
Rice has been criticised for her involvement in the [[George W. Bush administration]] both in the United States and abroad. Protesters have sought to exclude her from appearing at schools such as [[Princeton University]]<ref>Michael Juel-Larsen.

===''Time'' and ''Forbes'' magazines===
Rice has appeared on [[Time magazine]]'s list of the [[Time 100|world's 100 most influential people]] four times. Rice is one of only three people in the entire world considered influential enough to have made the list so frequently. However [[Time magazine]] has also accused her of squandering her influence, stating in [[February 1]], 2007, that her "accomplishments as Secretary of State have been modest, and even those have begun to fade" and that she "has been slow to recognize the extent to which the U.S.'s prestige has declined."<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1584810,00.html "Rice's Toughest Mission"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', [[February 1]], [[2007]].</ref> However, in its [[March 19]], 2007 issue it followed up stating that Rice was "executing an unmistakable course correction in U.S. foreign policy."<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1597516-2,00.html "Cheney In Twilight"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', [[March 19]], [[2007]].</ref>

In 2004 and 2005, she was ranked as the most powerful woman in the world by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine and number two in 2006 (following the [[Chancellor of Germany]], [[Angela Merkel]]).<ref>MacDonald, Elizabeth and Chana R. Schoenberger.[http://www.forbes.com/2006/08/31/most-powerful-women_cz_em_06women_0831intro.html "The World's Most Powerful Women"], ''Forbes'', September 1, 2006.</ref>

===Criticisms from Senator Boxer===
[[California]] Democratic Senator [[Barbara Boxer]] has also criticized Rice in relation to the [[war in Iraq]]: "I personally believe — this is my personal view — that your loyalty to the mission you were given, to sell the war, overwhelmed your respect for the truth."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A27818-2005Jan21.html Why the Crass Remarks About Rice?]. [[The Washington Post]], [[January 22]], [[2005]].</ref>

On [[January 11]], [[2007]], Boxer, in a debate over the [[war in Iraq]], said, "Now, the issue is who pays the price, who pays the price? I’m not going to pay a personal price. My kids are too old, and my grandchild is too young. You’re not going to pay a particular price, as I understand it, within immediate family. So who pays the price? The American military and their families, and I just want to bring us back to that fact.”

The ''[[New York Post]]'' and [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Tony Snow]] considered this an attack on Rice's status as a single, childless female and referred to Boxer's comments as "a great leap backward for feminism."<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,243359,00.html "White House Spokesman Blasts Sen. Boxer's Exchange With Secretary Rice"], [[FOX News]], [[January 12]], [[2006]].</ref> Rice later echoed Snow's remarks, saying "I thought it was okay to not have children, and I thought you could still make good decisions on behalf of the country if you were single and didn’t have children." Boxer responded to the controversy by saying "They’re getting this off on a non-existent thing that I didn’t say. I’m saying, she’s like me, we do not have families who are in the military."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/12/washington/12cnd-rice.html?ex=1176350400&en=b000ac5ebcd6d164&ei=5070 "Exchange Turns Into Political Flashpoint"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[January 12]], [[2007]]</ref>

===Views within the black community===
[[Image:RiceRatings.png|thumb|right|Rice's [[approval rating]]s from January 2005 to September 2006]] Rice's ratings saw decreases following a heated battle for her confirmation as Secretary of State and following [[Hurricane Katrina]] in August 2005. Rice's rise within the [[George W. Bush administration]] initially drew a largely positive response from many in the black community. In a 2002 survey, then National Security Advisor Rice was viewed favorably by 41% of black respondents, but another 40% did not know Rice well enough to rate her and her profile remained comparatively obscure.<ref name=Tilove>Jonathon Tilove. [http://www.newhousenews.com/archive/tilove031104.html For Black America, The Thrill of Powell and Rice Is Gone]. Newhouse News Service, [[March 11]], [[2004]].</ref> As her role increased, some black commentators began to express doubts concerning Rice's stances and statements on various issues. In 2005, ''[[Washington Post]]'' columnist [[Eugene Robinson (journalist)|Eugene Robinson]] asked, "How did [Rice] come to a worldview so radically different from that of most black Americans?"<ref>Eugene Robinson. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/24/AR2005102401370.html What Rice Can't See]. [[The Washington Post]], [[October 25]], [[2005]].</ref>

Other writers have also noted what they perceive to be a distance between Rice and the black community. ''[[The Black Commentator]]'' magazine described sentiments given in a speech by Rice at a black gathering as "more than strange — they were evidence of profound personal disorientation. A black woman who doesn’t know how to talk to black people is of limited political use to an administration that has few black allies."<ref>[http://www.blackcommentator.com/84/84_cover_condi.html Condoleezza's Crimes]. [[The Black Commentator]], [[April 1]], 2004.</ref> When Rice invoked the [[civil rights movement]] to clarify her position on the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]], Margaret Kimberley, another writer for ''The Black Commentator'', felt that her use of the rhetoric was "offensive." Stan Correy, an interviewer from the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], characterized many blacks involved with civil rights and politics as viewing this rhetoric as "cynical."<ref>Stan Correy. [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/bbing/stories/s1338813.htm Condoleezza, Condoleezza]. ABC Radio National, [[April 3]], [[2005]].</ref> Rice was also described by Bill Fletcher, Jr., the former leader of the [[TransAfrica Forum]], a [[foreign policy]] [[lobbying]] organization in [[District of Columbia|Washington, D.C.]], as "very cold and distant and only black by accident."<ref name=Tilove /> In August 2005, American [[musician]], [[actor]], and [[social activist]] [[Harry Belafonte]], who serves on the Board of TransAfrica, referred to blacks in the Bush administration as "black tyrants."<ref>Marc Merano.

Cybercast News Service, [[August 8]], [[2005]]</ref> Belafonte's comments received mixed reactions.<ref name=Tilove />

Rice has defended herself from such criticisms on several occasions. During a [[September 14]], 2005 interview, she said: "Why would I worry about something like that? ... The fact of the matter is I've been black all my life. Nobody needs to tell me how to be black."<ref>[http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/53155.htm Interview With Bill O'Reilly of the O'Reilly Factor on Fox News]. [[September 14]], [[2005]].</ref>
