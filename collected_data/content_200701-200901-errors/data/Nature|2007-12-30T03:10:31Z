'''Nature''', in the broadest sense, is equivalent to the '''natural world''', '''physical universe''', '''material world''' or '''material universe'''. "Nature" refers to the [[phenomenon|phenomena]] of the physical world, and also to [[life]] in general. The term generally does not include manufactured objects and human interaction unless qualified in ways such as, e.g., "[[human nature]]" or "the whole of nature". Nature is also generally distinguished from the [[supernatural]].  It ranges in scale from the [[subatomic]] to the [[galaxy|galactic]].

The word "nature" is derived from the Latin word ''natura'', or "the course of things, natural character."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=nature |title=Nature |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |accessmonthday=September 23|accessyear=2006}}</ref> ''Natura'' was a Latin translation of the Greek word ''[[physis]]'' (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.<ref>A useful though somewhat erratically presented account of the pre-Socratic use of the concept of φύσις may be found in Naddaf, Gerard ''The Greek Concept of Nature'', SUNY Press, 2006. The word φύσις, while first used in connection with a plant in Homer (as we have seen), occurs very early in Greek philosophy, and in several senses. Generally, these senses match rather well the current senses in which the English word ''nature'' is used, as confirmed by Guthrie, W.K.C. ''Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'' (volume 2 of his ''History of Greek Philosophy''), Cambridge UP, 1965.</ref> This is shown in the first written use of the word φύσις, in connection with a plant.<ref>The first known use of ''physis'' was by [[Homer]] in reference to the intrinsic qualities of a plant: ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι '''φύσιν''' αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε. (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its '''nature'''.) ''[[Odyssey]]'' 10.302-3 (ed. A.T. Murray). (The word is dealt with thoroughly in Liddell and Scott's ''[http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/pollux Greek Lexicon]''.) For later but still very early Greek uses of the term, see related below.</ref> The concept of nature as a whole, the physical [[universe]], is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers, and has steadily gained currency ever since. This usage was confirmed during the advent of modern [[scientific method]] in the last several centuries.<ref>Isaac Newton's [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] (1687), for example, is translated "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", and reflects the then-current use of the words "[[natural philosophy]]", akin to "systematic study of nature"</ref><ref>The etymology of the word "physical" shows its use as a synonym for "natural" in about the mid-15th century: {{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=physical |title=Physical |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |accessmonthday=September 20|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" may refer to the general realm of various types of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects &ndash; the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the [[weather]] and [[geology]] of the Earth, and the [[matter]] and [[energy]] of which all these things are composed.  It is often taken to mean the "[[natural environment]]" or [[wilderness]] &ndash; wild animals, rocks, forest, beaches, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention.  This more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the [[artificial]], with the latter being understood as that which has been brought into being by a [[human]] or human-like [[consciousness]] or [[mind]].

'''Earth''' (or, "the earth") is the fifth largest [[planet]] in the [[solar system]], third in order of distance from the [[Sun]]. It is the largest of its [[planetary system]]'s [[terrestrial planet]]s and the only place in the [[universe]] known to support life. 

The most prominent features of the earth's climate are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow [[temperate]] zones, and a wide [[equator]]ial [[tropical]] to [[subtropical]] region.<ref>An excellent summary description of global climate can be found at: {{cite web |url=http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/climate.htm |title=World Climates |work=Blue Planet Biomes |accessmonthday=September 21|accessyear=2006}}</ref> [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] patterns vary widely according to location, ranging from several [[metre]]s of water per year to less than a [[millimetre]]. About 70 percent of the surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with the vast majority of the inhabited land in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. 

Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions. The [[Crust (geology)|outer surface]] is divided into several [[tectonic plate]]s that gradually migrate across the surface over geologic time spans, which at least several times have changed relatively quickly. The interior of the planet remains active, with a thick layer of molten [[Earth mantle]] and an iron-filled core that generates a [[magnetic field]].

The [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life forms,<ref>{{cite web | date = September 11, 2005 | url = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/09/050911103921.htm | title = Calculations favor reducing atmopshere for early Earth | publisher = Science Daily | accessdate = 2007-01-06 }}</ref> which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions.

===Historical perspective===
{{main|History of Earth}}
[[Image:Pediastrumboryanum.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Phylum Pediastrumboryanum. Plankton have been part of nature on the Earth for at least the past 2 billion years.<ref>{{cite book |last=Margulis |first=Lynn |coauthors=Dorian Sagan |year=1995 |title=What is Life? |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |id=ISBN 0-684-81326-2}}</ref>]]
Based on the available evidence, scientists have reconstructed detailed information about the planet's past. Earth is estimated to have formed approximately 4.55 billion years ago out of the [[solar nebula]], along with the Sun and other planets.<ref>{{cite book |first=G. Brent |last=Dalrymple |year=1991 |title=The Age of the Earth |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford |id=ISBN 0-8047-1569-6}}</ref> The moon formed relatively soon afterwards (roughly 20 million years later, or 4.53 billion years ago).

Initially molten, the outer layer of the planet cooled, resulting in the solid crust. Outgassing and [[Volcano|volcanic]] activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing [[water vapor]], augmented by [[ice]] delivered by [[comet]]s, [[Origin of the world's oceans|produced the oceans]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Morbidelli |coauthors=''et al.'' |year=2000 |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000M&PS...35.1309M |title=Source Regions and Time Scales for the Delivery of Water to Earth |journal=Meteoritics & Planetary Science |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=pp. 1309-1320}}</ref> The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago.<ref>{{cite news | title=Earth's Oldest Mineral Grains Suggest an Early Start for Life | publisher=NASA Astrobilogy Institute | date=2001-12-24 | url=http://nai.arc.nasa.gov/news_stories/news_detail.cfm?ID=76 |accessmonthday=May 24|accessyear=2006}}</ref> 

Continents formed, then broke up and re-formed as the surface of Earth reshaped itself over the course of hundreds of millions of years, occasionally combining to make a [[supercontinent]]. Roughly 750 million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]] which broke apart about 540 million years ago, then finally [[Pangaea]], which broke apart about 180 million years ago.<ref>{{cite journal |first=J.B. |last=Murphy |coauthors=R.D.

There is significant evidence, still being discussed among scientists, that a severe [[Glacier|glacial]] action during the [[Neoproterozoic]] era covered much of the planet in a sheet of ice. This hypothesis has been termed the "[[Snowball Earth]]", and it is of particular interest as it precedes the [[Cambrian explosion]] in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530-540 million years ago.<ref>{{cite book |first=J.L. |last=Kirschvink |year=1992 |chapter=Late Proterozoic Low-Latitude Global Glaciation: The Snowball Earth |chapterurl=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~jkirschvink/pdfs/firstsnowball.pdf |title=The Proterozoic Biosphere |editor=J.W.

Several million years ago, a species of small African ape gained the ability to stand upright.<ref>{{cite book |last=Margulis |first=Lynn |coauthors=Dorian Sagan |year=1995 |title=What is Life? |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |id=ISBN 0-684-81326-2}}</ref> The subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further [[civilization]] allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate.

===Atmosphere, climate and weather===
{{main|Earth's atmosphere|climate|weather}}
The atmosphere of the Earth serves as a key factor in sustaining the planetary [[Nature#Ecosystems|ecosystem]]. The thin layer of [[gas]]es that envelops the Earth is held in place by the planet's gravity. Dry [[air]] consists of 78% [[nitrogen]], 21% [[oxygen]], 1% [[argon]] and other [[inert gases]], carbon dioxide, etc.; but air also contains a variable amount of [[water vapor]].  The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude, and has a [[scale height]] of about 8 [[kilometre]]s at the Earth's surface: the height at which the atmospheric pressure has declined by a factor of ''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]'' (a mathematical constant
equal to 2.71...).<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Pelletier | first = Jon D. | title=Natural variability of atmospheric temperatures and geomagnetic intensity over a wide range of time scales | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | year=2002 | volume=99 | pages=2546-2553 | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/99/suppl_1/2546 | accessdate = 2007-01-07 }}</ref> The [[ozone layer]] of the Earth's atmosphere plays an important role in depleting the amount of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As [[DNA]] is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.  

[[Image:Chaparral Supercell 2.JPG|left|thumb|260px|A [[supercell]] in the process of forming a [[thunderstorm]].]]
Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the [[troposphere|lower part of the atmosphere]], and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat. Ocean currents are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater [[thermohaline circulation]] which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the polar regions much colder.

Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Extremes in weather, such as [[tornado]]es or [[hurricane]]s and [[cyclone]]s, can expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce devastation. Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals dependent on its growth for their food.

The planetary climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather. Various factors are known to [[Climate change|influence the climate]], including ocean currents, surface [[albedo]], [[greenhouse gas]]es, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the planet's orbit. Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including [[ice age]]s.

The climate of a region depends on a number of factors, especially [[latitude]]. A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions, ranging from the [[tropical climate]] at the equator to the [[polar climate]] in the northern and southern extremes. Weather is also influenced by the [[seasons]], which result from the [[Earth]]'s [[axis of rotation|axis]] being [[axial tilt|tilted]] relative to its [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]. Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the planet is more directly exposed to the rays of the [[sun]]. This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the [[northern hemisphere|northern]] and [[southern hemisphere|southern]] hemispheres experience opposite seasons.

Weather is a [[Chaos theory|chaotic system]] that is readily modified by small changes to the [[Natural environment|environment]], so accurate [[Meteorology|weather forecasting]] is currently limited to only a few days. Overall, two things are currently happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.<ref>{{cite news | title=Tropical Ocean Warming Drives Recent Northern Hemisphere Climate Change | publisher=Science Daily|date=[[April 6]], [[2001]] | url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/04/010406073554.htm | accessdate=2006-05-24 }}</ref>

== Life == 
[[Image:Female mallard nest - natures pics edit2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Female mallard and ducklings - [[reproduction]] is essential for continuing life]]
{{main|Life|Biosphere}}
Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by [[Organism|organization]], [[metabolism]], [[cell growth|growth]], [[adaptation]], response to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] and [[reproduction]].<ref>{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php | title = Definition of Life  | publisher = California Academy of Sciences | accessdate = 2007-01-07 }}</ref> Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of [[organism]]s.

Properties common to terrestrial organisms ([[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[fungi]], [[protist]]s, [[archaea]] and [[bacteria]]) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with these properties is generally considered life. However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential. Human-made [[Artificial life|analogs of life]] may also be considered to be life.

The [[biosphere]] is the part of Earth's outer shell — including air, land, surface rocks and water — within which life occurs, and which [[biotic]] processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest [[Geophysiology|geophysiological]] point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the [[lithosphere]] (rocks), [[hydrosphere]] (water), and [[atmosphere]] (air).  Currently the entire Earth contains over 75 billion tons (150 ''trillion'' pounds or about 6.8&nbsp;x&nbsp;10<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;[[kilogram]]s) of [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.<ref>The figure "about one-half of one percent" takes into account the following (See, e.g., {{cite book |last=Leckie |first=Stephen |year=1999 |chapter=How Meat-centred Eating Patterns Affect Food Security and the Environment |chapterurl=http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-30610-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |title=For hunger-proof cities : sustainable urban food systems |publisher=International Development Research Centre |location=Ottawa |id=ISBN 0-88936-882-1}}, which takes global average weight as 60 kg.), the total human biomass is the average weight multiplied by the current human population of approximately 6.5 billion (see, ''e.g.'', {{cite web |title=World Population Information |url=http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/world.html |accessmonthday=September 28 |accessyear=2006 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}): Assuming 60–70 kg to be the average human mass (approximately 130–150&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]] on the average), an approximation of total global human mass of between 390 billion (390×10<sup>9</sup>) and 455 billion kg (between 845 billion and 975 billion lb, or about 423 million-488 million [[short ton]]s). The total biomass of all kinds on earth is estimated to be in excess of 6.8&nbsp;x&nbsp;10<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;kg (75 billion short tons). By these calculations, the portion of total biomass accounted for by humans would be very roughly 0.6%.</ref>

===Evolution===
Life, as we understand it, is currently only known to exist on the planet Earth. The [[origin of life]] is still a poorly understood process, but it is thought to have occurred about 3.9 to 3.5 billion years ago during the [[hadean]] or [[archean]] eons on a primordial earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present.<ref name=Line>{{cite journal | author = Line M | title = The enigma of the origin of life and its timing | url=http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/148/1/21?view=long&pmid=11782495 | journal = Microbiology | volume = 148 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 21-7 | year = 2002 | id = PMID 11782495}}</ref> These life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits. Once life had appeared, the process of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] resulted in the formation of ever-more diverse life forms.

Species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct. However, the [[fossil]] record retains evidence of many of these older species. Current fossil and [[DNA]] evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to the first primitive life forms.<ref name=Line/>

The advent of [[photosynthesis]] in very basic forms of plant life worldwide allowed the sun's energy to be harvested to create conditions allowing for more complex life. The resultant [[oxygen]] accumulated in the atmosphere and gave rise to the [[ozone layer]]. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the [[endosymbiotic theory|development of yet more complex cells]] called [[eukaryotes]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=L. V. |last=Berkner |coauthors=L. C.

However some microorganisms are [[pathogenic]] and can post health risk to other organisms.

===Plants and animals===
[[Image:Farming near Klingerstown, Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A confluence of "natural" and a "made" environment.]]
The distinction between plant and animal life is not sharply drawn, with some categories of life that stand between or across the two. Originally [[Aristotle]] divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move, and animals. In [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]' system, these became the [[kingdom (biology)|Kingdoms]] [[Vegetabilia]] (later [[Plantae]]) and [[Animal]]ia. Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the [[fungus|fungi]] and several groups of [[alga]]e were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora,<ref>{{cite web |title=flora |url=http://webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=flora |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessmonthday=September 27|accessyear=2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |year=1998 |title=Status and Trends of the Nation's Biological Resources |chapter=Glossary |chapterurl=http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/zy198.htm#F |publisher=Department of the Interior, Geological Survey |location=Reston, VA |id=SuDocs No. I 19.202:ST 1/V.1-2}}</ref> and some classifications use the term ''bacterial flora'' separately from ''plant flora''.

Among the many ways of classifying [[plants]] are by regional [[flora]]s, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include  ''fossil flora'', remnants of plant life from a previous era. People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and [[terrain]].

Regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as ''native flora'' and ''agricultural and garden flora'', the latter of which are intentionally grown and cultivated. Some types of "native flora" actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another, and become an integral part of the native, or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced. This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature.

Another category of plant has historically been carved out for ''weeds''. Though the term has fallen into disfavor among [[botanist]]s as a formal way to categorize "useless" plants, the informal use of the word "weeds" to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature. Similarly, animals are often categorized in ways such as ''domestic'', ''farm animals'', ''wild animals'', ''pests'', etc. according to their relationship to human life.

[[Image:Wilderbeest.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Wildebeest]] in [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]], [[Tanzania]]. Note the tendency to congregate, one of nature's displays of what is sometimes called the [[herding instinct]] or [[herd behavior]].]]

[[Animals]] as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things, though not traced by scientists to having legs or wings instead of roots and leaves.  Animals are [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] and usually [[multicellular]] (although see [[Myxozoa]]), which separates them from [[bacteria]], [[archaea]] and most [[protist]]s.  They are [[heterotroph]]ic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from [[plant]]s and [[alga]]e. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and [[fungus|fungi]] by lacking [[cell wall]]s.

With a few exceptions, most notably the [[sea sponge|sponge]]s (Phylum Porifera), animals have bodies differen­tiated into separate [[biological tissue|tissues]]. These include [[muscle]]s, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a [[nervous system]], which sends and processes signals. There is also typically an internal [[digestion|digestive]] chamber. The eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of [[collagen]] and elastic [[glycoprotein]]s. This may be calcified to form structures like [[Animal shell|shell]]s, [[bone]]s, and [[spicule]]s, a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation, and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility.

{{main|Ecology|Ecosystem}}
All forms of life interact with the environment in which they exist, and also with other life forms.  In the 20th century this premise gave rise to the concept of '''ecosystems''', which can be defined as any situation where there is interaction between organisms and their environment.

Ecosystems are composed of a variety of [[abiotic]] and [[biotic]] components that function in an interrelated way.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |year=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd Edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Introduction to the Ecosystem Concept |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9j.html |accessmonthday=September 28|accessyear=2006}}</ref> The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated. Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem. Some of the more important components are: soil, atmosphere, radiation from the sun, water, and living organisms.

Each living organism has a continual relationship with every other element that makes up its environment. Within the ecosystem, species are connected and dependent upon one another in the [[food chain]], and exchange [[energy]] and [[matter]] between themselves as well as with their environment.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |year=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd Edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Organization of Life |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9d.html |accessmonthday=September 28|accessyear=2006}}</ref></blockquote>

[[Image:Chicago Downtown Aerial View.jpg|right|thumb|260px|An aerial view of a [[human ecosystem]]. Pictured is the city of [[Chicago]]]]
Every species has limits of tolerance to factors that affect its survival, reproductive success and ability to continue to thrive and interact sustainably with the rest of its environment, which in turn may have effects on these factors for many other species or even on the whole of life.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |year=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd Edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Abiotic Factors and  the Distribution of Species |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9e.html |accessmonthday=September 28|accessyear=2006}} esp. section on "Abiotic Factors and Tolerance Limits."</ref> The concept of an ecosystem is thus an important subject of study, as such study provides information needed to make decisions about how human life may interact in a way that allows the various ecosystems to be sustained for future use rather than used up or otherwise rendered ineffective. For the purpose of such study, a unit of smaller size is called a ''[[microecosystem]]''. For example, an ecosystem can be a stone and all the life under it. A ''macroecosystem'' might involve a whole [[ecoregion]], with its [[drainage basin]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bailey |first=Robert G. |year=2004 |month=April |title=Identifying Ecoregion Boundaries |journal=Environmental Management |volume=34 |issue=Supplement 1 |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/news_info/Identifying_ecoregion_boundaries.pdf |id={{doi|10.1007/s00267-003-0163-6}} }}</ref> 

The following ecosystems are examples of the kinds currently under intensive study:
* "continental ecosystems", such as "forest ecosystems", "meadow ecosystems" such as [[steppe]]s or [[savanna]]s), or  [[Agroecology|agro-ecosystem]]s,
* systems in inland waters, such as [[lentic]] ecosystem"s such as [[lake]]s or [[pond]]s; or [[lotic]] ecosystems such as [[river]]s,
* [[oceanic]] ecosystems.

Another classification can be made by reference to its communities, such as in the case of a [[human ecosystem]]. Regional groupings of distinctive plant and animals best adapted to the region's physical [[natural environment]], latitude, altitude, and terrain are known as [[biome]]s. The broadest classification, today under wide study and analysis, and also subject to widespread arguments about its nature and validity, is that of the entire sum of life seen as analogous to a self-sustaining organism; a theory studied as [[Earth science|earth system science]] (less formally known as [[Gaia theory]]).<ref>{{cite journal | last = Lawton | first = John | title=Earth System Science | journal=Science | year=2001 | volume=292 | issue=5524 | pages=1965 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/292/5524/1965 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | first =Stephan | last=Harding | year = 2006 | url = http://www.schumachercollege.org.uk/articles/college-articles/stephan/earthsystemscience.html | title = Earth System Science and Gaian Science | publisher = Schumacher College | accessdate = 2007-01-07 }}</ref>

==Human interrelationship==
[[Image:Na Pali Coast - Kauai.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The secluded valleys along the [[Na Pali Coast]] in [[Hawaii]] are the residence of [[tribes]] that make only small changes in the natural beauty surrounding them.]]

Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what we regard as nature and "made environments" is not clear cut except at the extremes. Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is presently diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace, or, according to some, has already disappeared.

The development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards. In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human [[civilization]] remains closely linked to changes in the environment. There exists a highly complex feedback-loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood.<ref>{{cite news | title=Feedback Loops In Global Climate Change Point To A Very Hot 21st Century | publisher=Science Daily | date=May 22, 2006 | url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/ESD-feedback-loops.html | accessdate=2007-01-07 }}</ref> Manmade threats to the Earth's natural environment include [[pollution]], [[deforestation]], and disasters such as oil spills. Humans have contributed to the [[extinction]] of many plants and animals.

Humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities. The acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains a primary component of the world's economic system. Some activities, such as [[hunting]] and [[fishing]], are used for both sustenance and leisure, often by different people. [[Agriculture#History|Agriculture]] was first adopted around the [[9th millennium BCE]]. Ranging from food production to [[energy]], nature influences economic wealth.

Although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nps.gov/plants/medicinal/plants.htm | title = Plant Conservation Alliance - Medicinal Plant Working Groups Green Medicine | publisher = US National Park Services | language = English |accessmonthday=September 23|accessyear=2006}}</ref> most modern human use of plants is through agriculture.

===Wilderness===
[[Image:Daintree Rainforest.JPG|thumb|left|160px|The [[Daintree Rainforest]], a wilderness area in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]].]]
{{main|Wilderness|Natural environment}}

'''Wilderness''' is generally defined as a [[natural environment]] on [[Earth]] that has not been directly modified by [[human]] activity. [[Ecologist]]s consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the planet's self-sustaining natural [[ecosystem]] (the [[biosphere]]).  

The word, "wilderness", derives from the notion of [[wildness]]; in other words that which is not controllable by humans.  The word's [[etymology]] is from the [[Old English]] ''wildeornes'', which in turn derives from ''wildeor'' meaning ''wild beast'' (wild + deor = beast, deer).<ref>"Wilderness", in ''The Collins English Dictionary'' (2000)</ref> From this point of view, it is the wildness of a place that makes it a wilderness.  The mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being "wilderness."  Many ecosystems that are, or have been, inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered "wild." This way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which natural processes operate without very noticeable human interference.

==Beauty in nature==
[[Image:Salmonlarvakils.jpg|thumb|right|130px|[[Salmon]] [[fry]] hatching.  The root of the [[Latin]]   "''natura''" {"nature") is "''natus''," from "''nasci''" ("to be born").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=nature |title=Nature |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |accessmonthday=September 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref>]]
[[Image:Xsxlt fankuan.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Painting by [[Song Dynasty]] artist [[Fan Kuan]] (c. 970&ndash;1020).]]
Beauty in nature is has long been a common theme in life and in art, and books emphasizing beauty in nature fill large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much [[art]], [[photography]], [[poetry]] and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Why this association exists, and what the association consists of, is studied by the branch of philosophy called [[aesthetics]].  Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless.<ref> For an example of a range of opinions, see: {{cite web |url=http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |title=On the Beauty of Nature |publisher=The Wilderness Society |accessmonthday=September 29|accessyear=2006 }} and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s analysis of the subject: {{cite book |last=Emerson |first=Ralph Waldo |year=1849 |title=Nature; Addresses and Lectures |chapter=Beauty |chapterurl=http://www.emersoncentral.com/beauty.htm}}</ref>

Looked at through the lens of the [[visual arts]], nature and wildness have been important subjects in various epochs of world history.  An early tradition of [[landscape art]] began in [[China]] during the [[Tang Dynasty art|Tang Dynasty]] (618-907).  The tradition of representing nature ''as it is'' became one of the aims of [[Chinese painting]] and was a significant influence in Asian art.  Artists learned to depict mountains and rivers "from the perspective of nature as a whole and on the basis of their understanding of the laws of nature … as if seen through the eyes of a bird."  In the 13th century, the [[Song Dynasty]] artist [[Shi Erji]] listed "scenes lacking any places made inaccessible by nature," as one of the 12 things to avoid in painting.<ref>[http://www.asia-art.net/chinese_tech_brush.html Chinese brush painting] Asia-art.net Accessed: May 20, 2006. </ref>

In the [[Western culture|Western world]] the idea of wilderness having intrinsic value emerged in the 1800s, especially in the works of the [[Romantic movement]].  [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] artists [[John Constable]] and [[JMW Turner]] turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. [[William Wordsworth|William Wordsworth’s]] poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.<ref name=History>[http://www.spacesfornature.org/greatspaces/conservation.html History of Conservation] BC Spaces for Nature. Accessed: May 20, 2006. </ref> This artistic movement also coincided with the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist movement]] in the Western world.

Many scientists, who study nature in more specific and organized ways, also share the conviction that nature is beautiful; the French mathematician, [[Henri Poincaré|Jules Henri Poincaré]] (1854-1912) said:<blockquote>The scientist does not study nature because it is useful; he studies it because he delights in it, and he delights in it because it is beautiful.</br>If nature were not beautiful, it would not be worth knowing, and if nature were not worth knowing, life would not be worth living. Of course I do not here speak of that beauty which strikes the senses, the beauty of qualities and of appearance; not that I undervalue such beauty, far from it, but it has nothing to do with science; I mean that profounder beauty which comes from the harmonious order of the parts and which a pure intelligence can grasp.<ref>{{cite book |last=Poincaré |first=Jules Henri |year=1913 |translator=G.B. Halsted |title= The foundations of science; Science and hypothesis, The value of science, Science and method |publisher=The Science Press |location=New York |oclc=2569829 |pages=pp. 366-7}}</ref></blockquote>

A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word [[mimesis]], the imitation of nature.  Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through symmetry, equal division, and other perfect mathematical [[forms]] and notions.

== Matter and energy ==
{{main|Matter|Energy}}
[[Image:HAtomOrbitals.png|thumb|left|135px|The first few [[hydrogen atom]] [[electron orbital]]s shown as cross-sections with color-coded probability density]]

Some fields of [[science]] see nature as matter in motion, obeying certain laws of nature which science seeks to understand. For this reason the most fundamental science is generally understood to be "[[physics]]"&mdash;the name for which is still recognizable as meaning that it is the study of nature. 

Matter is commonly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed. It constitutes the [[observable universe]]. According to the theory of [[special relativity]], there is no unchangeable distinction between matter and [[energy]], because matter can be converted to energy (see [[annihilation]]), and vice versa (see [[matter creation]]).  The visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4 percent of the total mass. The remainder is believed to consist of 23 percent cold [[dark matter]] and 73 percent [[dark energy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_mm/mr_limits.html |title=Some Theories Win, Some Lose |work=[[WMAP]] Mission: First Year Results |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessmonthday=29|accessyear=2006 }}</ref> The exact nature of these components is still unknown and is currently under intensive investigation by physicists.

The behavior of matter and energy throughout the [[observable universe]] appears to follow well-defined [[physical law]]s. These laws have been employed to produce [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models that successfully explain the structure and the evolution of the universe we can observe. The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty [[physical constant]]s<ref>{{cite web | last = Taylor | first = Barry N. | year = 1971 | url = http://www.physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/introduction.html | title = Introduction to the constants for nonexperts | publisher = National Institute of Standards and Technology | accessdate = 2007-01-07

{{main|Outer space|Universe}}

'''Outer space''', also simply called ''space'', refers to the relatively empty regions of the [[universe]] outside the [[celestial body's atmosphere|atmosphere]]s of celestial bodies. ''Outer'' space is used to distinguish it from [[airspace]] (and terrestrial locations). There is no discrete boundary between the [[Earth's atmosphere]] and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude. Outer space within the [[solar system]] is called [[interplanetary space]], which passes over into [[interstellar medium|interstellar space]] at what is known as the [[heliopause]].

Outer space is certainly spacious, but it is far from empty.  Outer space is sparsely filled with several dozen types of [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[molecule]]s discovered to date by [[rotational spectroscopy|microwave spectroscopy]],  [[cosmic microwave background radiation|blackbody radiation]] left over from the [[big bang]] and the origin of the universe, and [[cosmic ray]]s, which include [[ion]]ized [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and various [[subatomic particle]]s. There is also some gas, [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and [[dust]], and small [[meteor]]s.  Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this [[space debris|debris]] re-enters the atmosphere periodically.

Although the planet Earth is currently the only known body within the solar system to support life, current evidence suggests that in the distant past the planet [[Mars]] possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bibring J, Langevin Y, Mustard J, Poulet F, Arvidson R, Gendrin A, Gondet B, Mangold N, Pinet P, Forget F, Berthé M, Bibring J, Gendrin A, Gomez C, Gondet B, Jouglet D, Poulet F, Soufflot A, Vincendon M, Combes M, Drossart P, Encrenaz T, Fouchet T, Merchiorri R, Belluci G, Altieri F, Formisano V, Capaccioni F, Cerroni P, Coradini A, Fonti S, Korablev O, Kottsov V, Ignatiev N, Moroz V, Titov D, Zasova L, Loiseau D, Mangold N, Pinet P, Douté S, Schmitt B, Sotin C, Hauber E, Hoffmann H, Jaumann R, Keller U, Arvidson R, Mustard J, Duxbury T, Forget F, Neukum G | title = Global mineralogical and aqueous mars history derived from OMEGA/Mars Express data | journal = Science | volume = 312 | issue = 5772 | pages = 400-4 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 16627738}}</ref> For a brief period in Mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life.

Conditions on the other terrestrial planets, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]], appears to be too harsh to support life as we know it. But it has been conjectured that [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], the fourth-largest moon of [[Jupiter]], may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.<ref>{{cite web | author = Scott Turner | date = 1998-03-02 | url = http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/news8.html | title = Detailed Images From Europa Point To Slush Below Surface | publisher = The Brown University News Bureau | language = English |accessmonthday=September 28|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Recently, the team of [[Stéphane Udry]] have discovered a new planet named [[Gliese 581 c]], which is an [[extrasolar]] planet orbiting the [[red dwarf]] [[star]] [[Gliese 581]]. Gliese 581 c appears to lay in the [[habitable zone]] of space surrounding the [[star]], and therefore could possibly host [[life]] as we know it.
