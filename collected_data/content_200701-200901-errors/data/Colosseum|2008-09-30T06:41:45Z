The '''Colosseum''' or '''Roman Coliseum''', originally the '''Flavian Amphitheatre''' ([[Latin]]: ''Amphitheatrum Flavium'', [[Italian language|Italian]] ''Anfiteatro Flavio'' or ''Colosseo''), is an elliptical [[amphitheatre]] in the centre of the city of [[Rome]], [[Italy]], the largest ever built in the [[Roman Empire]]. It is one of the greatest works of [[Roman architecture]] and [[Roman engineering]].

Occupying a site just east of the [[Roman Forum]], its construction started between 70 and 72 AD under the emperor [[Vespasian]] and was completed in 80 AD under [[Titus]], with further modifications being made during [[Domitian]]'s reign (81&ndash;96).<ref name="roth">{{cite book | first=Leland M. | last=Roth | year=1993 | title=Understanding Architecture: Its Elements, History and Meaning | edition =First | publisher=Westview Press | location=Boulder, CO | id=ISBN 0-06-430158-3 | pages=}}</ref> The name "''Amphitheatrum Flavium''" derives from both Vespasian's and Titus's family name (''Flavius'', from the ''gens Flavia'').

Originally capable of seating around 50,000 spectators, the Colosseum was used for [[gladiator]]ial contests and public spectacles. It remained in use for nearly 500 years with the last recorded games being held in the 6th century. As well as the gladiatorial games, other public spectacles were held there, such as mock sea battles, animal hunts, [[capital punishment|executions]], re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on [[Roman mythology|Classical mythology]]. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] era. It was later reused for such  purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a [[fortress]], a [[quarry]], and a [[Christianity|Christian]] shrine.

It has been estimated that about 500,000 people and over a million wild animals died in the Colosseum games.<ref>[http://www.kidcyber.com.au/topics/colosseum.htm COLOSSEUM]</ref><ref>[http://ocw.kfupm.edu.sa/user%5CARC11001%5CHTML%20Notes%5CM7_html_notes/Roman%20Buildings.htm Colosseum Rome 72-80 A.D.], Department of Architecture, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals</ref> 

Although in the 21st century it is in a ruined condition due to damage caused by [[earthquake]]s and stone-robbers, the Colosseum is now an [[icon]]ic symbol of [[Imperialism|Imperial]] Rome. It is one of Rome's most popular [[tourist attraction]]s and still has close connections with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], as each [[Good Friday]] the [[Pope]] leads a torchlit [[Stations of the Cross#Modern Usage|"Way of the Cross" procession]] to the amphitheatre.<ref name="wayofthecross-frommers">{{cite web|url=http://events.frommers.com/sisp/index.htm?fx=event&event_id=11442|title=Frommer's Events - Event Guide: Good Friday Procession in Rome (Palatine Hill, Italy)|publisher=Frommer's|accessdate=2008-04-08}}</ref>

The Colosseum is also depicted on the [[Italian euro coins|Italian version]] of the [[5 cent euro coins|five-cent euro coin]].

==Name==
The Colosseum's original Latin name was ''Amphitheatrum Flavium'', often anglicized as ''Flavian Amphitheater''. The building was constructed by emperors of the [[Flavian dynasty]], hence its original name.<ref name="logan">{{cite web|url=http://www.wilhelmaerospace.org/Architecture/rome/colosseum/colosseum.html#flavius|title=The Flavian Dynasty|author=Willy Logan|accessdate=2007-09-25}}</ref> This name is still used frequently in [[modern English]], but it is generally unknown. In antiquity, Romans may have referred to the Colosseum by the unofficial name ''Amphitheatrum Caesareum''; this name could have been strictly poetic.<ref name="edmondson-josephus">{{cite book|title=Flavius Josephus and Flavian Rome|pages=114|author=J. C. Edmondson|coauthors=Steve Mason, J. B. Rives|year=2005|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=2008-01-26}}</ref><ref name="thecolosseum-history1">{{cite web|url=http://www.the-colosseum.net/history/h1.htm|title=The Colosseum - History 1|accessdate=2008-01-26}}</ref> This name was not exclusive to the Colosseum; Vespasian and Titus, builders of the Colosseum, also constructed an [[Flavian Amphitheater (Pozzuoli)|amphitheater of the same name]] in [[Puteoli]] (modern Pozzuoli).<ref>[[Amedeo Maiuri|Mairui, Amedeo]]. ''Studi e ricerche sull'Anfiteatro Flavio Puteolano''. [[Naples|Napoli]] : G. Macchiaroli, 1955. (OCLC {{OCLC search link|2078742}})</ref>

The name ''Colosseum'' has long been believed to be derived from a [[Colossus of Nero|colossal statue of Nero]] nearby.<ref name=roth /> This statue was later remodeled by [[Nero]]'s successors into the likeness of [[Helios]] (''Sol'') or [[Apollo]], the sun god, by adding the appropriate solar crown. Nero's head was also replaced several times with the heads of succeeding emperors. Despite its [[paganism|pagan]] links, the statue remained standing well into the medieval era and was credited with [[magical powers]]. It came to be seen as an iconic symbol of the permanence of Rome.

In the 8th century, the [[Bede|Venerable Bede]] (c. 672&ndash;735) wrote a famous epigram celebrating the symbolic significance of the statue: ''Quandiu stabit coliseus, stabit et Roma; quando cadit coliseus, cadet et Roma; quando cadet Roma, cadet et mundus'' ("as long as the Colossus stands, so shall Rome; when the Colossus falls, Rome shall fall; when Rome falls, so falls the world").<ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia">{{cite web | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04101b.htm | title = The Coliseum | work = The Catholic Encyclopedia | publisher = New Advent | accessmonthday = August 2 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> This is often mistranslated to refer to the Colosseum rather than the Colossus (as in, for instance, [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]]'s poem ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]''). However, at the time that Bede wrote, the [[grammatical gender|masculine noun]] ''coliseus'' was applied to the statue rather than to what was still known as the Flavian amphitheatre.

The Colossus did eventually fall, probably being pulled down to reuse its [[bronze]]. By the year 1000 the name "Colosseum" (a neuter noun) had been coined to refer to the amphitheatre. The statue itself was largely forgotten and only its base survives, situated between the Colosseum and the nearby [[Temple of Venus and Roma]].<ref name="claridge" />

The name was further corrupted to ''Coliseum'' during the Middle Ages. In Italy, the amphitheatre is still known as ''il Colosseo'', and other [[Romance language]]s have come to use similar forms such as ''le Colisée'' ([[French language|French]]), ''el Coliseo'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]) and ''o Coliseu'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]).

==History==
===Ancient===
[[Image:Map of downtown Rome during the Roman Empire large.png|right|thumb|A map of central Rome during the Roman Empire, with the Colosseum at the upper right corner]]
Construction of the Colosseum began under the rule of the Emperor [[Vespasian]]<ref name=roth/> in around 70–72. The site chosen was a flat area on the floor of a low valley between the [[Caelian Hill|Caelian]], [[Esquiline Hill|Esquiline]] and [[Palatine Hill]]s, through which a [[canal]]ised stream ran. By the 2nd century BC the area was densely inhabited. It was devastated by the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in AD 64, following which [[Nero]] seized much of the area to add to his personal domain. He built the grandiose ''[[Domus Aurea]]'' on the site, in front of which he created an artificial lake surrounded by pavilions, gardens and porticoes. The existing ''Aqua Claudia'' [[aqueduct]] was extended to supply water to the area and the gigantic bronze [[Colossus of Nero]] was set up nearby at the entrance to the Domus Aurea.<ref name="claridge">{{cite book | first=Amanda | last=Claridge | year=1998 | title=Rome: An Oxford Archaeological Guide | edition =First | publisher=Oxford University Press, 1998 | location=Oxford, UK | id=ISBN 0-19-288003-9 | pages=pp. 276–282}}</ref>

The area was transformed under Vespasian and his  successors. Although the Colossus was preserved, much of the Domus Aurea was torn down. The lake was filled in and the land reused as the location for the new Flavian Amphitheatre. Gladiatorial schools and other support buildings were constructed nearby within the former grounds of the Domus Aurea. According to a reconstructed inscription found on the site, "the emperor Vespasian ordered this new amphitheatre to be erected from his general's share of the booty." This is thought to refer to the vast quantity of treasure seized by the Romans following their victory in the [[Great Jewish Revolt]] in 70. The Colosseum can be thus interpreted as a great triumphal monument built in the Roman tradition of celebrating great victories.<ref name="claridge" /> Vespasian's decision to build the Colosseum on the site of Nero's lake can also be seen as a populist gesture of returning to the people an area of the city which Nero had appropriated for his own use. In contrast to many other amphitheatres, which were located on the outskirts of a city, the Colosseum was constructed in the city centre; in effect, placing it both literally and symbolically at the heart of Rome.

The Colosseum had been completed up to the third story by the time of Vespasian's death in 79. The top level was finished and the building inaugurated by his son, [[Titus]], in 80.<ref name=roth/> [[Dio Cassius]] recounts that over 9,000 wild animals were killed during the [[Inaugural games of the Flavian Amphitheatre|inaugural games]] of the amphitheatre. The building was remodelled further under Vespasian's younger son, the newly-designated Emperor [[Domitian]], who constructed the ''[[hypogeum]]'', a series of underground tunnels used to house animals and slaves. He also added a gallery to the top of the Colosseum to increase its seating capacity.

In 217, the Colosseum was badly damaged by a major fire (caused by lightning, according to Dio Cassius<ref>Cass. Dio lxxviii.25</ref>) which destroyed the wooden upper levels of the amphitheatre's interior. It was not fully repaired until about 240 and underwent further repairs in 250 or 252 and again in 320. An inscription records the restoration of various parts of the Colosseum under [[Theodosius II]] and [[Valentinian III]] (reigned 425–450), possibly to repair damage caused by a major earthquake in 443; more work followed in 484 and 508. The arena continued to be used for contests well into the 6th century, with gladiatorial fights last mentioned around 435. Animal hunts continued until at least 523.<ref name="claridge" />

===Medieval===
[[Image:Coliseo medieval.jpg|left|thumb|Map of medieval Rome depicting the Colosseum]]
The Colosseum underwent several radical changes of use during the medieval period. By the late 6th century a small church had been built into the structure of the amphitheatre, though this apparently did not confer any particular religious significance on the building as a whole. The arena was converted into a cemetery. The numerous vaulted spaces in the arcades under the seating were converted into housing and workshops, and are recorded as still being rented out as late as the 12th century. Around 1200 the [[Frangipani family]] took over the Colosseum and fortified it, apparently using it as a castle. 

Severe damage was inflicted on the Colosseum by the great earthquake in 1349, causing the outer south side to collapse. Much of the tumbled stone was reused to build palaces, churches, hospitals and other buildings elsewhere in Rome. A religious order moved into the northern third of the Colosseum in the mid-14th century and continued to inhabit it until as late as the early 19th century. The interior of the amphitheatre was extensively stripped of stone, which was reused elsewhere, or (in the case of the marble façade) was burned to make [[quicklime]].<ref name="claridge" /> The bronze clamps which held the stonework together were pried or hacked out of the walls, leaving numerous pockmarks which still scar the building today.

===Modern===
[[Image:Cole Thomas Interior of the Colosseum Rome 1832.jpg|right|thumb|''Interior of the Colosseum, Rome''. [[Thomas Cole]], 1832. Note the [[Stations of the Cross]] around the arena and the extensive vegetation, both removed later in the 19th century.]]
During the 16th and 17th century, Church officials sought a productive role for the vast derelict hulk of the Colosseum. [[Pope Sixtus V]] (1585–1590) planned to turn the building into a wool factory to provide employment for Rome's prostitutes, though this proposal fell through with his premature death.<ref>"Rome." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 2006.</ref> In 1671 Cardinal Altieri authorized its use for [[bullfight]]s; a public outcry caused the idea to be hastily abandoned. 

In 1749, [[Pope Benedict XIV]] endorsed as official Church policy the view that the Colosseum was a sacred site where early Christians had been [[martyr]]ed. He forbade the use of the Colosseum as a quarry and consecrated the building to the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]] and installed [[Stations of the Cross]], declaring it sanctified by the blood of the [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|Christian martyrs]] who perished there (''see [[#Christians and the Colosseum|Christians and the Colosseum]]''). Later popes initiated various stabilization and restoration projects, removing the extensive vegetation which had overgrown the structure and threatened to damage it further. The façade was reinforced with triangular brick wedges in 1807 and 1827, and the interior was repaired in 1831, 1846 and in the 1930s. The arena substructure was partly excavated in 1810&ndash;1814 and 1874 and was fully exposed under [[Mussolini]] in the 1930s.<ref name="claridge" />

The Colosseum is today one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions, receiving millions of visitors annually. The effects of pollution and general deterioration over time prompted a major restoration programme carried out between 1993 and 2000, at a cost of 40 billion [[Italian lira|Italian lire]] ($19.3m / €20.6m at 2000 prices). In recent years it has become a symbol of the international campaign against [[capital punishment]], which was abolished in Italy in 1948. Several anti–death penalty demonstrations took place in front of the Colosseum in 2000. Since that time, as a gesture against the death penalty, the local authorities of Rome change the color of the Colosseum's night time illumination from white to gold whenever a person condemned to the death penalty anywhere in the world gets their sentence commuted or is released,<ref>{{cite news|first=Gayle |last=Young |author= |url=http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/views/y/2000/02/young.italydeath.feb24/ |title=On Italy's passionate opposition to death penalty |work=CNN.com |publisher=CNN |date=2000-02-24 |accessdate=2006-08-02}}</ref> or if a jurisdiction abolishes the death penalty. Most recently, the Colosseum was illuminated in gold when capital punishment was abolished in the American state of [[New Jersey]] in December 2007.[http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2007/12/colosseum_lit_up_to_mark_un_nj.html]
[[Image:Colloseum through the city street.jpg|right|thumb|Today, the Colosseum is a common background in the busy metropolis that is modern Rome.]]
Due to the ruined state of the interior, it is impractical to use the Colosseum to host large events; only a few hundred spectators can be accommodated in temporary seating. However, much larger concerts have been held just outside, using the Colosseum as a backdrop. Performers who have played at the Colosseum in recent years have included [[Ray Charles]] (May 2002),<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1983176.stm Colosseum stages peace concert], BBC News Online, 12 May 2002.</ref> [[Paul McCartney]] (May 2003),<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3019241.stm McCartney rocks the Colosseum], BBC News Online, 12 May 2003</ref> and [[Elton John]] (September 2005).<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4213352.stm Sir Elton's free gig thrills Rome], BBC News Online, 4 September 2005</ref>

On [[July 7]], [[2007]], the Colosseum was voted as one of New Open World Corporation's [[New Seven Wonders of the World]].

==Physical description==
===Exterior===

[[Image:L-Kolloseum.png|right|thumb|Cross-section from the [[Lexikon der gesamten Technik]] (1904)]]

Unlike earlier amphitheatres that were built into hillsides, the Colosseum is an entirely free-standing structure. It is elliptical in plan and is 189 metres (615&nbsp;ft / 640 Roman feet) long, and 156 metres (510&nbsp;ft / 528 Roman feet) wide, with a base area of {{convert|6|acre|m2}}. The height of the outer wall is 48 metres (157&nbsp;ft / 165 Roman feet). The perimeter originally measured 545 metres (1,788&nbsp;ft / 1,835 Roman feet). The central arena is an oval (287&nbsp;ft) long and (180&nbsp;ft) wide, surrounded by a wall (15&nbsp;ft) high, above which rose tiers of seating. 

The outer wall is estimated to have required over 100,000 cubic meters (131,000&nbsp;[[Cubic yard|cu&nbsp;yd]]) of [[travertine]] stone which were set without mortar held together by 300 tons of iron clamps.<ref name="claridge" /> However, it has suffered extensive damage over the centuries, with large segments having collapsed following earthquakes. The north side of the perimeter wall is still standing; the distinctive triangular brick wedges at each end are modern additions, having been constructed in the early 19th century to shore up the wall. The remainder of the present-day exterior of the Colosseum is in fact the original interior wall.

The surviving part of the outer wall's monumental façade comprises three stories of superimposed [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]] surmounted by a [[podium]] on which stands a tall [[attic]], both of which are pierced by windows interspersed at regular intervals. The arcades are framed by half-columns of the [[Doric order|Doric]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]], and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] orders, while the attic is decorated with Corinthian [[pilaster]]s.<ref name="oxford_classical">Ian Archibald Richmond, Donald Emrys Strong, Janet DeLaine. "Colosseum", ''The Oxford Companion to Classical Civilization''. Ed. Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth. Oxford University Press, 1998</ref> Each of the arches in the second- and third-floor arcades framed statues, probably honoring divinities and other figures from [[Classical mythology]].

Two hundred and forty mast [[corbel]]s were positioned around the top of the attic. They originally supported a retractable [[awning]], known as the ''[[velarium]]'', that kept the sun and rain off spectators. This consisted of a canvas-covered, net-like structure made of ropes, with a hole in the center.<ref name=roth/> It covered two-thirds of the arena, and sloped down towards the center to catch the wind and provide a breeze for the audience. Sailors, specially enlisted from the Roman naval headquarters at [[Misenum]] and housed in the nearby ''Castra Misenatium'', were used to work the ''[[velarium]]''.<ref>{{cite web | last = Downey | first =  Charles T. | date = February 9, 2005 | url = http://ionarts.blogspot.com/2005/02/colosseum-was-skydome.html | title =  The Colosseum Was a Skydome? | accessmonthday = August 2 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

The Colosseum's huge crowd capacity made it essential that the venue could be filled or evacuated quickly. Its architects adopted solutions very similar to those used in modern stadiums to deal with the same problem. The amphitheatre was ringed by eighty entrances at ground level, 76 of which were used by ordinary spectators.<ref name=roth/> Each entrance and exit was numbered, as was each staircase. The northern main entrance was reserved for the [[Roman Emperor]] and his aides, whilst the other three axial entrances were most likely used by the elite. All four axial entrances were richly decorated with painted [[stucco]] reliefs, of which fragments survive. Many of the original outer entrances have disappeared with the collapse of the perimeter wall, but entrances XXIII (23) to LIV (54) still survive.<ref name="claridge" />

Spectators were given tickets in the form of numbered pottery shards, which directed them to the appropriate section and row. They accessed their seats via ''[[vomitoria]]'' (singular ''vomitorium''), passageways that opened into a tier of seats from below or behind. These quickly dispersed people into their seats and, upon conclusion of the event or in an emergency evacuation, could permit their exit within only a few minutes. The name ''vomitoria'' derived from the Latin word for a rapid discharge, from which [[English language|English]] derives the word [[vomit]].

===Interior seating===
[[Image:Colosseum-profile-english.png|left|thumb|Side view of Colosseum seating]]
According to the [[Chronography of 354|Codex-Calendar of 354]], the Colosseum could accommodate 87,000 people, although modern estimates put the figure at around 50,000. They were seated in a tiered arrangement that reflected the rigidly stratified nature of Roman society. Special boxes were provided at the north and south ends respectively for the Emperor and the [[Vestal Virgins]], providing the best views of the arena. Flanking them at the same level was a broad platform or ''podium'' for the [[Roman Senate|senatorial]] class, who were allowed to bring their own chairs. The names of some 5th century senators can still be seen carved into the stonework, presumably reserving areas for their use. 

The tier above the senators, known as the ''maenianum primum'', was occupied by the non-senatorial noble class or knights (''[[Equestrian (Roman)|equites]]''). The next level up, the ''maenianum secundum'', was originally reserved for ordinary Roman citizens (''[[Plebs|plebians]]'') and was divided into two sections. The lower part (the ''immum'') was for wealthy citizens, while the upper part (the ''summum'') was for poor citizens. Specific sectors were provided for other social groups: for instance, boys with their tutors, soldiers on leave, foreign dignitaries, scribes, heralds, priests and so on. Stone (and later marble) seating was provided for the citizens and nobles, who presumably would have brought their own cushions with them. Inscriptions identified the areas reserved for specific groups.

Another level, the ''maenianum secundum in legneis'', was added at the very top of the building during the reign of [[Domitian]]. This comprised a gallery for the common poor, [[Slavery|slave]]s and women. It would have been either standing room only, or would have had very steep wooden benches. Some groups were banned altogether from the Colosseum, notably gravediggers, actors and former gladiators.<ref name="claridge" />

Each tier was divided into sections (''maeniana'') by curved passages and low walls (''praecinctiones'' or ''baltei''), and were subdivided into ''cunei'', or wedges, by the steps and aisles from the vomitoria. Each row (''gradus'') of seats was numbered, permitting each individual seat to be exactly designated by its gradus, cuneus, and number.<ref>Samuel Ball Platner (as completed and revised by Thomas Ashby), ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Amphitheatrum_Flavium.html A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome]''. Oxford University Press, 1929</ref>

===Arena and hypogeum===
[[Image:Kolosseumbannen.jpg|right|thumb|The Colosseum arena, showing the ''hypogeum''. The wooden walkway is a modern structure.]]
[[Image:Colloseum-hypogeum-detail.jpg|thumb|Detail of the hypogeum]]
The arena itself was 83&nbsp;metres by 48&nbsp;metres (272&nbsp;ft by 157&nbsp;ft / 280 by 163&nbsp;Roman feet).<ref name="claridge" /> It comprised a wooden floor covered by sand (the Latin word for sand is ''harena'' or ''arena''), covering an elaborate underground structure called the ''hypogeum'' (literally meaning "underground"). Little now remains of the original arena floor, but the ''hypogeum'' is still clearly visible. It consisted of a two-level subterranean network of tunnels and cages beneath the arena where gladiators and animals were held before contests began. Eighty vertical shafts provided instant access to the arena for caged animals and scenery pieces concealed underneath; larger hinged platforms, called ''hegmata'', provided access for elephants and the like. It was restructured on numerous occasions; at least twelve different phases of construction can be seen.<ref name="claridge" />

The ''hypogeum'' was connected by underground tunnels to a number of points outside the Colosseum. Animals and performers were brought through the tunnel from nearby stables, with the gladiators' barracks at the [[Ludus Magnus]] to the east also being connected by tunnels. Separate tunnels were provided for the Emperor and the Vestal Virgins to permit them to enter and exit the Colosseum without needing to pass through the crowds.<ref name="claridge" />

Substantial quantities of machinery also existed in the ''hypogeum''. Elevators and pulleys raised and lowered scenery and props, as well as lifting caged animals to the surface for release. There is evidence for the existence of major [[hydraulic]] mechanisms<ref name="claridge" /> and according to ancient accounts, it was possible to flood the arena rapidly, presumably via a connection to a nearby aqueduct.

===Supporting buildings===
[[Image:Colosseo3.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The Colosseum - a view from Colle Oppio]]
The Colosseum and its activities supported a substantial industry in the area. In addition to the amphitheatre itself, many other buildings nearby were linked to the games. Immediately to the east is the remains of the ''[[Ludus Magnus]]'', a training school for gladiators. This was connected to the Colosseum by an underground passage, to allow easy access for the gladiators. The ''Ludus Magnus'' had its own miniature training arena, which was itself a popular attraction for Roman spectators. Other training schools were in the same area, including the ''Ludus Matutinus'' (Morning School), where fighters of animals were trained, plus the Dacian and Gallic Schools.

Also nearby were the ''Armamentarium'', comprising an armory to store weapons; the ''Summum Choragium'', where machinery was stored; the ''Sanitarium'', which had facilities to treat wounded gladiators; and the ''Spoliarium'', where bodies of dead gladiators were stripped of their armor and disposed of.

Around the perimeter of the Colosseum, at a distance of 18&nbsp;m (59&nbsp;ft) from the perimeter, was a series of tall stone posts, with five remaining on the eastern side. Various explanations have been advanced for their presence; they may have been a religious boundary, or an outer boundary for ticket checks, or an anchor for the ''[[velarium]]'' or awning.<ref name="claridge" />

Right next to the Colosseum is also the [[Arch of Constantine]].

==Use==
[[Image:Jean-Leon Gerome Pollice Verso.jpg|right|250px|thumb|''[[Pollice Verso]]'' (''"Thumbs Down"'') by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]], 1872]]
The Colosseum was used to host [[gladiator]]ial shows as well as a variety of other events. The shows, called ''munera'', were always given by individuals rather than the state. They had a strong religious element but were also demonstration of power and family prestige, and were immensely popular with the population. Another popular type of show was the animal hunt, or ''[[venatio]]''. This utilised a great variety of wild beasts, mainly imported from [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], and included creatures such as [[rhinoceros]], [[hippopotamus]]es, [[elephant]]s, [[giraffe]]s, [[aurochs]], [[wisent]]s, [[barbary lion]]s, [[leopard|panther]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[bear]]s, [[caspian tiger]]s, [[alligators]], [[crocodile]]s and [[ostrich]]es. Battles and hunts were often staged amid elaborate sets with movable trees and buildings. Such events were occasionally on a huge scale; [[Trajan]] is said to have celebrated his victories in [[Dacia]] in 107 with contests involving 11,000 animals and 10,000 gladiators over the course of 123 days.

During the early days of the Colosseum, ancient writers recorded that the building was used for ''[[naumachia]]e'' (more properly known as ''navalia proelia'') or simulated sea battles. Accounts of the inaugural games held by Titus in AD 80 describe it being filled with water for a display of specially trained swimming horses and bulls. There is also an account of a re-enactment of a famous sea battle between the [[Corfu|Corcyrean]] (Corfiot) Greeks and the [[Corinth]]ians. This has been the subject of some debate among historians; although providing the water would not have been a problem, it is unclear how the arena could have been waterproofed, nor would there have been enough space in the arena for the warships to move around. It has been suggested that the reports either have the location wrong, or that the Colosseum originally featured a wide floodable channel down its central axis (which would later have been replaced by the hypogeum).<ref name="claridge" />

''Sylvae'' or recreations of natural scenes were also held in the arena. Painters, technicians and architects would construct a simulation of a forest with real trees and bushes planted in the arena's floor. Animals would be introduced to populate the scene for the delight of the crowd. Such scenes might be used simply to display a natural environment for the urban population, or could otherwise be used as the backdrop for hunts or dramas depicting episodes from mythology. They were also occasionally used for executions in which the hero of the story — played by a condemned person — was killed in one of various gruesome but mythologically authentic ways, such as being mauled by beasts or burned to death.

===Today===
The Colosseum today is now a major tourist attraction in Rome with thousands of tourists each year paying to view the interior arena, though entrance for EU citizens is partially subsidised, and under-18 and over-65 EU citizens' entrances are free.<ref>[http://www.the-colosseum.net/idx-en.htm The Colosseum.net : The resourceful site on the Colosseum<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  There is now a museum dedicated to [[Eros]] located in the upper floor of the outer wall of the building.  Part of the arena floor has been re-floored.

The Colosseum is also the site of [[Roman Catholic]] ceremonies in the 20th and 21st centuries. For instance, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] performs the [[Stations of the Cross]] called the [[Scriptural Way of the Cross]] (which calls for more meditation) at the Colosseum<ref>Joseph M Champlin, ''The Stations of the Cross With Pope John Paul II'' Liguori Publications, 1994, ISBN 0892436794</ref><ref>Vatican Description of the Stations of the Cross at the [[Colosseum]]: http://www.pcf.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20000421_via-crucis_en.html</ref> on [[Good Friday]]s.<ref name="wayofthecross-frommers" />

==Christians and the Colosseum==
[[Image:The Christian Martyrs Last Prayer.jpg|thumb|left|280px|''The Christian Martyrs' Last Prayer'', by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1883).]]

In the Middle Ages, the Colosseum was clearly not regarded as a sacred site. Its use as a fortress and then a quarry demonstrates how little spiritual importance was attached to it, at a time when sites associated with martyrs were highly venerated. It was not included in the itineraries compiled for the use of pilgrims nor in works such as the 12th century ''[[Mirabilia Urbis Romae]]'' ("Marvels of the City of Rome"), which claims the [[Circus Flaminius]] — but not the Colosseum — as the site of martyrdoms. Part of the structure was inhabited by a Christian order, but apparently not for any particular religious reason.
[[Image:Ignatius.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Martyrdom of Saint [[Ignatius of Antioch]], often said to have taken place in the Colosseum. Note how the saint is framed by a stylized depiction of the Colosseum.]]

It appears to have been only in the 16th and 17th centuries that the Colosseum came to be regarded as a Christian site. [[Pope Pius V]] (1566-1572) is said to have recommended that pilgrims gather sand from the arena of the Colosseum to serve as a relic, on the grounds that it was impregnated with the blood of martyrs. This seems to have been a minority view until it was popularised nearly a century later by [[Fioravante Martinelli]], who listed the Colosseum at the head of a list of places sacred to the martyrs in his 1653 book ''Roma ex ethnica sacra''. 

Martinelli's book evidently had an effect on public opinion; in response to Cardinal Altieri's proposal some years later to turn the Colosseum into a bullring, Carlo Tomassi published a pamphlet in protest against what he regarded as an act of desecration. The ensuing controversy persuaded [[Pope Clement X]] to close the Colosseum's external arcades and declare it a sanctuary, though quarrying continued for some time to come.

At the instance of St. [[Leonard of Port Maurice]], Pope [[Benedict XIV]] (1740-1758) forbade the quarrying of the Colosseum and erected [[Stations of the Cross]] around the arena, which remained until February 1874. St. [[Benedict Joseph Labre]] spent the later years of his life within the walls of the Colosseum, living on [[alms]], prior to his death in 1783. Several 19th century popes funded repair and restoration work on the Colosseum, and it still retains a Christian connection today. Crosses stand in several points around the arena and every [[Good Friday]] the Pope leads a [[Via Crucis]] procession to the amphitheatre.

==Flora==
[[Image:Colosseum-flora.jpg|left|thumb|Plants on the inner walls of the Colosseum]]
The Colosseum has a wide and well-documented history of [[Flora (plants)|flora]] ever since [[Domenico Panaroli]] made the first catalogue of its plants in 1643. Since then, 684 species have been identified there. The peak was in 1855 (420 species). Attempts were made in 1871 to eradicate the vegetation, due to concerns over the damage that was being caused to the masonry, but much of it has returned.<ref name="claridge" /> 242 species have been counted today and of the species first identified by Panaroli, 200 remain.

The variation of plants can be explained by the change of climate in Rome through the centuries. Additionally, [[bird migration]], flower blooming, and the growth of Rome that caused the Colosseum to become embedded within the modern city centre rather than on the outskirts of the ancient city, as well as deliberate transport of species, are also contributing causes. One other romantic reason often given is their seeds being unwittingly transported on the animals brought there from all corners of the empire.

==Popular culture==
[[Image:Colosseum gladiator.jpg|right|thumb|The Colosseum as digitally recreated for ''[[Gladiator (2000 movie)|Gladiator]]'']]
The iconic status of the Colosseum has led it to be featured in numerous films and other items of popular culture:

*[[Cole Porter]]'s song "[[You're the Top]]" from the musical ''[[Anything Goes]]'' (1934) includes the line "You're the Top, You're the Colosseum" 
*In the 1953 film ''[[Roman Holiday (1953 film)|Roman Holiday]]'', the Colosseum famously serves as the backdrop for several scenes.
*In the 1954 film ''[[Demetrius and the Gladiators]]'', the Emperor [[Caligula]] anachronistically sentences the Christian Demetrius to fight in the Colosseum.  
*The conclusion of the 1957 film ''[[20 Million Miles to Earth]]'' takes place at the Colosseum.
*In the 1972 film ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'', [[Bruce Lee]] fought [[Chuck Norris]] in the Colosseum.
*In [[Ridley Scott]]'s 2000 film ''[[Gladiator (2000 movie)|Gladiator]]'', the Colosseum was re-created via [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) to "restore" it to the glory of its heyday in the 2nd century. The depiction of the building itself is generally accurate and it gives a good impression of what the underground ''hypogeum'' would have been like.
* In the 2008 film ''[[Jumper (film)|Jumper]]'', the Colosseum was used as the location for one of the battles between the jumpers and those trying to kill them.
* In the 2003 science fiction film ''[[The Core]]'', the Colosseum along with the rest of Rome is destroyed by a huge lightning superstorm.  
The Colosseum's fame as an entertainment venue has also led the name to be re-used for modern entertainment facilities, particularly in the United States, where theatres, [[music hall]]s and large buildings used for sport or exhibitions have commonly been called Colosseums or Coliseums.<ref>"Coliseum". ''Pocket Fowler's Modern English Usage''. Ed. Robert Allen. Oxford University Press, 1999</ref>

The [[optical disc authoring software]] program [[Nero Burning ROM]] uses an image of the Colosseum on fire as one of its main icons, even though Emperor [[Nero]]'s [[Great Fire of Rome]] (which the program's name and icon refer to) occurred in 64 AD, before the Colosseum was built.
