In the state of [[Indiana]], [[U.S. Route 30]] is an east-west four-lane divided highway across northern [[Indiana]]. It runs from the [[Illinois]] state line at [[Dyer, Indiana|Dyer]] to east of [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] at the [[Ohio]] state line. This is a distance of 151.8 miles (244.3&nbsp;km).

== Route description ==
===Dyer to Valparaiso ===
{{seealso|Lincoln Highway}}
U.S. 30 enters Dyer from [[Lynwood, Illinois]] along the original alignment of the Lincoln Highway. It has four lanes from the state line through the densely populated cities of Dyer, [[Schererville, Indiana|Schererville]] and [[Merrillville, Indiana|Merrillville]]. East of [[U.S. Route 41]], U.S. 30 becomes a [[divided highway]], and remains largely divided through the rest of the state.

East of Merrillville, U.S. 30 runs through rural areas until reaching the outskirts of [[Valparaiso, Indiana|Valparaiso]]. It runs through the southern portion of Valparaiso as Morthland Avenue before leaving the city at a full interchange with [[Indiana State Road 2]].

=== Valparaiso to Fort Wayne ===
[[Image:US 30 west of Fort Wayne, Indiana.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Route 30 west of Fort Wayne, Indiana]]
U.S. 30 continues eastward<ref>Indiana 2000; Indiana Department of Transporatation</ref>, along the original Lincoln Highway right of way, diverging around each town.  At Wanatah, it meets with [[U.S. Route 421]], running from Michigan City, Indiana on Lake Michigan southward towards Indianapolis and later the Ohio River.

Beyond [[Wanatah, Indiana|Wanatah]] the countryside is primarily rural.  U.S. passes by Hanna and then runs over the [[Kankakee River]].  Following towns of [[Hamlet, Indiana|Hamlet]], Grovertown, and Donaldson are all traffic lights with a gas station or a convenience store.<ref>Annual personal travel along this route since 1991</ref>  [[Plymouth, Indiana|Plymouth]] ({{Convert|63|mi|km|0}} from Illinois border) is the next major city.  The road passes to the north of town.  Here, there are two intersections of store and restaurants.

Beyond [[Plymouth, Indiana|Plymouth]] is again rural divided highway, passing Inwood, Bourbon, Etna Green, and Atwood<ref>Indiana 2000; Indiana Department of Transporatation</ref>.  Twenty-six miles beyond Plymouth, is [[Warsaw, Indiana|Warsaw]]. From Warsaw it's {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} to [[Columbia City, Indiana|Columbia City]] and another grouping of shops and stores.  Columbia City is a convenient stop as it's {{convert|21|mi|km|0}} from Fort Wayne and it's easier to get on and off U.S. 30 than in Fort Wayne.<ref>Annual personal travel along this route since 1991</ref>

=== Fort Wayne to the Ohio state line ===
[[U.S. Route 33]] joins US 30 in a shared approach to [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] for a short concurrence which ends at [[Interstate 69]] (abbreviated I-69).   U.S. 30 to the east follows I-69, and U.S. 33 to the east follows I-69 to the south, a highway now designated as [[Indiana 930]] continuing as a divided surface route, itself a former bypass of old U.S. 30 along the north and east sides of Fort Wayne. U.S. 30 now follows [[Interstate 469]] to the south and east through terrain still rural as of 2009.  I-469 East and U.S. 30 run concurrently around the north and east side of [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] for {{convert|12|mi|km|0}}, after which U.S. 30 leaves I-469 and meets the eastern terminus of [[Indiana 930]].  For {{convert|14|mi|km|0}} U.S. 30 takes a southeasterly  course on a divided surface highway to the Indiana/Ohio state line with no identifiable towns along the route.<ref>Annual personal travel along this route since 1991</ref>
