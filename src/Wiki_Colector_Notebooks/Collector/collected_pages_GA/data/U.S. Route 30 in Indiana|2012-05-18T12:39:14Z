In the state of [[Indiana]], [[U.S. Route 30]] is an east&ndash;west four-lane divided highway across northern [[Indiana]]. It runs from the [[Illinois]] state line at [[Dyer, Indiana|Dyer]] to east of [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] at the [[Ohio]] state line. This is a distance of 151.8 miles (244.3&nbsp;km).

== Route description ==
===Dyer to Valparaiso ===
{{see also|Lincoln Highway}}
U.S. 30 enters Dyer from [[Lynwood, Illinois]] along the original alignment of the Lincoln Highway. It has four lanes from the state line through the densely populated cities of Dyer, [[Schererville, Indiana|Schererville]] and [[Merrillville, Indiana|Merrillville]]. East of [[U.S. Route 41]], U.S. 30 becomes a [[divided highway]], and remains largely divided through the rest of the state.

East of Merrillville, U.S. 30 runs through rural areas until reaching the outskirts of [[Valparaiso, Indiana|Valparaiso]]. It runs through the southern portion of Valparaiso as Morthland Avenue before leaving the city at a full interchange with [[Indiana State Road 2]] and [[Indiana State Road 49]].

=== Valparaiso to Fort Wayne ===
[[Image:US 30 west of Fort Wayne, Indiana.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Route 30 west of Fort Wayne, Indiana]]
U.S. 30 continues eastward<ref name="ReferenceA">Indiana 2000; Indiana Department of Transporatation</ref>, along the original Lincoln Highway right of way, diverging around each town.  At Wanatah, it meets with [[U.S. Route 421]], running from Michigan City, Indiana on Lake Michigan southward towards Indianapolis and later the Ohio River.

Beyond [[Wanatah, Indiana|Wanatah]] the countryside is primarily rural.  U.S. 30 passes by Hanna and then runs over the [[Kankakee River]].  Following towns of [[Hamlet, Indiana|Hamlet]], Grovertown, and Donaldson are all traffic lights with a gas station or a convenience store.<ref>Annual personal travel along this route since 1991</ref>  [[Plymouth, Indiana|Plymouth]] ({{Convert|63|mi|km|0}} from Illinois border) is the next major city.  The road passes to the north of town.  Here, there are two intersections of store and restaurants.

Beyond [[Plymouth, Indiana|Plymouth]] is again rural divided highway, passing Inwood, Bourbon, Etna Green, and Atwood<ref name="ReferenceA"/>.  Twenty-six miles beyond Plymouth, is [[Warsaw, Indiana|Warsaw]]. From Warsaw it's {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} to [[Columbia City, Indiana|Columbia City]] and another grouping of shops and stores.

=== Fort Wayne to the Ohio state line ===
[[U.S. Route 33 in Indiana|US&nbsp;33]] joins US&nbsp;30 in a shared approach to [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] for a short concurrency which ends at [[Interstate 69 in Indiana|I-69]].   US&nbsp;30 follows I-69 north and US&nbsp;33 follows I-69 south, a highway now designated as [[Indiana 930]] continuing as a divided surface route, itself a former bypass of old US&nbsp;30 along the north and east sides of Fort Wayne. US&nbsp;30 now follows [[Interstate 469]] to the south and east through rural areas.  I-469 and US&nbsp;30 run concurrently around the north and east side of [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] for {{convert|12|mi|km|0}}, after which US&nbsp;30 leaves I-469 and meets the eastern terminus of [[Indiana 930]].  For {{convert|14|mi|km|0}} the road takes a southeasterly course on a divided surface highway to the Indiana/Ohio state line with no identifiable towns along the route. <ref name="googleA">{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=U.S.+30+E&daddr=U.S.+30+E&hl=en&ll=41.103156,-84.951782&spn=0.266981,0.673599&sll=40.996873,-84.802008&sspn=0.016713,0.0421&geocode=FaSKcwIdAP3r-g%3BFWGVcQIdzv7x-g&mra=me&mrsp=1,0&sz=15&t=m&z=11|title=Overview of US&nbsp;30 from Fort Wayne to Ohio state line |accessdate=March 6, 2012}}</ref>
