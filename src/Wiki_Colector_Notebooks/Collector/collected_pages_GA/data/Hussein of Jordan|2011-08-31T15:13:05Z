'''Hussein bin Talal''' ({{lang-ar|حسين بن طلال}}, ''{{unicode|Ḥusayn bin Ṭalāl}}''; 14 November 1935 – 7 February 1999) was the third [[List of Kings of Jordan|King]] of [[Jordan]] from the abdication of his father, [[Talal of Jordan|King Talal]], in 1952, until his death. Hussein's rule extended through the [[Cold War]] and four decades of [[Arab-Israeli conflict]].<ref name="CNN1">{{cite news|title=King Hussein is dead|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9902/07/king.hussein.obit/|publisher=CNN|date=1999-02-07}}</ref> He recognized Israel in 1994, becoming the second Arab head of state to do so.

Hussein's family claims to descent from the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] and [[Hashemite|his clan]].<ref name="CNN1" />

==Early life and accession==
Hussein was born in [[Amman]] on 14 November 1935 to [[Talal of Jordan|Talal bin Abdullah]] and [[Zein al Sharaf Talal|Princess Zein al-Sharaf bint Jamil]]. After completing his elementary education in Amman, he was educated at [[Victoria College, Alexandria|Victoria College]] in [[Alexandria]]. He proceeded to [[Harrow School]] in [[England]], where he befriended his cousin [[Faisal II of Iraq]]. He pursued further study at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]].


On  20 July 1951, Prince Hussein traveled to [[Jerusalem]] to perform [[Friday prayers]] at the  [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] with his grandfather, [[Abdullah I of Jordan|King Abdullah I]], where an assassin opened fire on Abdullah and his grandson. Abdullah was killed, but the 15-year-old Hussein survived the assassination attempt, and according to the Jordanian government, pursued the gunman. The Jordanian government claims that the gunman turned his weapon on the young prince, who was saved when the bullet was deflected by a medal on his uniform which had been given to him by his grandfather.<ref name="CNN1" />

Abdullah was appointed Crown Prince of Jordan on 9 September 1951. Abdullah's eldest son, [[Talal of Jordan|King Talal]], became [[King of Jordan]], but within a year was forced to abdicate owing to his mental state (European and Arab doctors diagnosed schizophrenia).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalty.nu/MiddleEast/Jordan/Hussein.html |title=Royalty in Jordan - The Life of King Hussein |publisher=Royalty.nu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-01}}</ref> King Talal's son, Crown Prince Hussein, was proclaimed King of the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]] on 11 August 1952, succeeding at the age of 16; because this was under the legal age, he was enthroned a year later, on  2 May 1953.<ref name="CNN1" />

A trained aircraft pilot, he was also known for flying [[airplane]]s (propeller and jet), as well as [[helicopter]]s as a hobby.

King Hussein was succeeded as king by his eldest son [[Abdullah II of Jordan]].

==Reign==
[[File:King Hussein in 1955 visit to UK - Royal Hasemite Image.gif|thumb|King Hussein on a British Air Force base in 1955.]]
In March 1956 Hussein was appointed the King of Jordan, and burnished his own nationalist credentials by dismissing [[John Bagot Glubb|Glubb “Pasha”]] as the commander of the Jordanian Army, and replacing all the British officers with Jordanians. This now mainly [[Bedouin]] army was fiercely loyal to him, due to tribal connections.

Hussein's rule was marred with secret collaboration with Israel and the United States, which often adversely affected the surrounding Arab States and peoples, including the Palestinians. Secret meetings between King Hussein and Israeli foreign ministers [[Abba Eban]] and [[Golda Meir]] began on or before 1963. At first the meetings took place in London at the home of Dr. Emanuel Herbert, King Hussein's physician. Dr. Herbert, a Jew who desired to help Hussein and the Israeli government became the confidential go-between for contact between Israel and Jordan. Jordan, sharing the longest contiguous border with Israel was very interested in maintaining a peaceful posture towards Israel. As [[Avi Shlaim]] states Hussein's "...purpose throughout the 1960s was to see if there was any way to resolve the dispute with Israel peacefully." 

King Hussein sought to understand Israel's position and preferred dialogue to the futility of war with its many dangers. Much of this desire grows out of the threat from other Arab states, specifically the Ba'athist regimes in Iraq and Syria and Nasser's ideology of Arab nationalism which had heavily influenced the Army. The first secret meeting took place on September 24, 1963 between King Hussein and [[Yaacov Herzog]], a diplomat with wide experience and special emissary of prime minister [[Levi Eshkol]].<ref>Shlaim 2007, p.&nbsp;194–203 (Lion of Jordan: The Life of King Hussein in War and Peace).</ref> Among other things such as discussions regarding water rights, the purpose of the meetings were to plan and support Israeli and Jordanian initiatives in combating [[Fatah]] guerrillas. Hussein accepted minor raids into Jordanian territory by the [[Israeli Defence Forces]].  He would later state "I told them I could not absorb a serious retaliatory raid, and they accepted the logic of this and promised there would never be one".<ref>Bowen 2003, p.&nbsp;26 (citing Amman Cables 1456, 1457, 11 December 1966, National Security Files (Country File: Middle East), LBJ Library (Austin, Texas), Box 146).</ref>

On Nov 13, 1966, Israeli military conducted a major incursion into Jordanian territory, violating their secret agreement with King Hussein, in what became known as the [[Samu Incident]]. Two days later, in response to the incident, in a memo to [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], his Special Assistant [[Walt Whitman Rostow|Walt Rostow]] wrote: "retaliation is not the point in this case. This 3000-man raid with tanks and planes was out of all proportion to the provocation and was aimed at the wrong target," and went on to describe the damage done to US and Israeli interests:
<blockquote>They've wrecked a good system of tacit cooperation between Hussein and the Israelis... They've undercut Hussein. We've spent $500 million to shore him up as a stabilizing factor on Israel's longest border and vis-à-vis Syria and Iraq. Israel's attack increases the pressure on him to counterattack not only from the more radical Arab governments and from the Palestinians in Jordan but also from the Army, which is his main source of support and may now press for a chance to recoup its Sunday losses... They've set back progress toward a long term accommodation with the Arabs... They may have persuaded the Syrians that Israel didn't dare attack Soviet-protected Syria but could attack US-backed Jordan with impunity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/www/about_state/history/vol_xviii/zh.html |title=Memorandum From the President's Special Assistant (Rostow) to President Johnson |location=Washington |date=15 November 1966 |accessdate=22 October 2005}}</ref></blockquote>

Perception of King Hussein's secret collaboration with Israel led to great dissatisfaction of his rule both at home and throughout the Arab World.  President [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]] of [[Egypt]] often referred to Hussein as "an "imperialist lackey".<ref name="bbc onthisday">BBC On this Day, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/30/newsid_2493000/2493177.stm Egypt and Jordan unite against Israel]. Retrieved 8 October 2005.</ref>  Army Commander-in-Chief General [[Sharif Zaid Ben Shaker]] warned in a press conference that "If Jordan does not join the war a civil war will erupt in Jordan".<ref>quoted in Mutawi 2002, p.&nbsp;102.</ref>  In order to maintain credibility in the Arab world and maintain stability at home, on May 30, 1967, King Hussein signed a mutual defense treaty with Egypt, and handed over command of the Jordanian military to Egyptian generals.

==Six-Day War==
{{Main|Six-Day War}}
In June 1967, as a result of what later became known as the [[Six-Day War]] Jordan lost control of the [[West Bank]] and [[east Jerusalem]] and saw its military shattered.  In addition the country was, for a second time, over-run with many Palestinian refugees, fleeing the Israeli assault. Much like after the 1948 war, Israel did not allow the fleeing refugees to return to the territories it had captured during the war.  As a result, Palestinian refugees who fled the 1948 and 1967 wars, outnumbered Jordan's natural citizens. Most refugees were provided citizenship by the Hussein regime. Due to their sheer numbers, Palestinian factions in Jordan were able to exercise considerable authority essentially governing some areas of Jordan, leading to many considering them a state within a state, eroding Hussein's central authority.<ref name="CNN2">{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9902/07/king.hussein.obit/chrono/chrono.html |title=CNN - Highlights of King Hussein's life |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-01}}</ref>

==Black September==
{{Main|Black September in Jordan|l1=Black September}}
In September, 1970, in accordance with secret agreements with Israel and the US, Hussein ordered the forcible expulsion of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] by the Jordanian military. The attacks on Palestinian fighters and civilians further deteriorated King Hussein's image in the Arab and Muslim world. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==1973 Arab-Israeli War==
{{Main|Yom Kippur War}}
After the death of Egyptian president [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]], his successor, Anwar Sadat, made several offers of peace and recognition, in return for the Egyptian lands captured by Israel during the [[six day war]]. The Israeli government rejected all offers, in line with US secretary of state  [[Henry Kissinger]]'s stalemate policy. .<ref name="response">"[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1947-1974/28%20The%20Jarring%20initiative%20and%20the%20response-%208%20Febr The Jarring initiative and the response]," ''Israel's Foreign Relations'', Selected Documents, vols. 1–2, 1947–1974 . Retrieved June 9, 2005.</ref> Sadat warned that Egypt would attempt to recapture the territories through war, but the Israeli government, perhaps due to the perception of the Israeli military invincibility after the [[six day war]], dismissed Sadat's threat as empty posturing.

Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]] and Syrian president [[Hafez al-Assad]] met King Hussein in 1973 to discuss the possibility of war. Hussein, fearing another loss of territory to Israel, declined.  Furthermore, Hussein was suspicious of Sadat's promise to [[PLO]] Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] to hand over the West Bank to the Palestinians in the event of a victory, as he considered the [[West Bank]] to be Jordanian territory.  On the night of September 25, Hussein secretly flew to [[Tel Aviv]]  to warn Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir of an impending Syrian attack. "Are (the Syrians) going to war without the Egyptians, asked Mrs. Meir. The king said he didn't think so. 'I think they [Egypt] would cooperate'".<ref>Rabinovich, The Yom Kippur War, Schocken Books, 2004. Page 50</ref>

On Oct 6, 1973, Syria and Egypt attacked Israel without the aid of Jordan. The war led to Israel taking Sadat seriously and engaging in negotiations which resulted in the return of captured Egyptian territories and the recognition of Israel by Egypt.

==The Gulf War==
{{Hashemite-Jordan}}
{{Main|Gulf War}}
Jordan remained neutral during the [[Gulf War]] primarily due to the country's severe economic reliance of Iraqi oil.

==Peace with Israel==
{{Main|Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace}}

In 1994, Hussein concluded negotiations to end the official state of war with [[Israel]] resulting in the [[Israel–Jordan Treaty of Peace]] which he had begun negotiating in secret with the Israelis in the 1960s. Between 1963—1994 he had held at least 55 secret meetings with leading Israelis including at least seven prime and foreign ministers.<ref>(''The Economist'', 11/24/07, p.88)</ref> 

Due to the close relationship forged with Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] during the negotiations of the treaty, Hussein was invited to give a speech during Rabin's funeral.

==Summit of the Peacemakers==
On  13 March 1996 the “Summit of the Peacemakers” was held at [[Sharm el-Sheikh]], [[Egypt]] hosted by Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]]. In addition to King Hussein, Turkish President [[Suleiman Demirel]], Israeli Prime Minister [[Shimon Peres]], US President [[Bill Clinton]],  and Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] were present at the summit. The summit was convened with the expressed aim of putting the Israeli-Palestinian peace process back on track after a period of increased tension and hostility.

==Hebron Agreement==
{{Main|Hebron Agreement}}
Hussein was often involved in negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians. His 11th-hour intervention in January 1997 is said to have brought Palestinian Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] and Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] to an agreement on the long-awaited withdrawal of Israeli troops from most of the [[West Bank]] town of [[Hebron]].

==The Wye accords==
{{Main|Wye River Memorandum}}
In 1997 U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] invited Hussein, who was in the US undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer, to attend the [[Wye River Memorandum|Wye Plantation talks]]. Hussein received a standing ovation at the ceremony and praise from Clinton{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Illness==
At the end of July 1998 it was made public that Hussein was diagnosed [[lymphatic cancer]] by doctors at the [[Mayo Clinic]]. Hussein's [[lymphoma]] was of a type that responded to [[chemotherapy]], which the King had already begun and his physicians were optimistic he could be cured. Speaking on Jordanian television via [[satellite]], Hussein reassured the Jordanian people that the cancer was curable. Nevertheless, he looked fragile and pale. It was the 62-year-old monarch's second bout with cancer; he lost a kidney to the disease in 1992.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}}

On his way back to Jordan in January 1999, Hussein stopped in [[London]].<ref name="jordanembassyus.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.jordanembassyus.org/011699001.htm |title=King to address Jordanians tonight ahead of Tuesday return |publisher=Jordanembassyus.org |date=1999-01-16 |accessdate=2010-07-01}}</ref> Doctors advised him to rest and stay in England for a few weeks, as he was still too fragile to travel. According to Jordanian government sources, Hussein stated that:

::“I need very much to feel the warmth of my people around me, there is work to be done and I will get the strength from my people to finish the business.“<ref>Mideastnews.com; 8 February 1999</ref>

Upon returning to Jordan Hussein was greeted by family members, ministers, parliament members, foreign dignitaries and a crowd of Jordanian citizens, estimated by Jordanian government officials of 2 million.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9902/07/king.hussein.obit/chrono/chrono.html | work=CNN | title=Highlights of King Hussein's life | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref>

==Death==
Just before his death, Hussein made a change to his will, disinheriting the heir-apparent of several decades, his brother [[Prince Hassan bin Talal|Hassan]], in favor of his eldest son [[Abdullah II of Jordan|Abdullah]]. He abruptly returned to the U.S. clinic on 25 January 1999 for further treatment undergoing a failed [[bone marrow transplant]] after which he returned to Jordan.

On 7 February 1999 King Hussein died of complications related to [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]. He was, at the time of his death, one of the longest-serving leaders in international politics.<ref name="CNN1" /> He had been the King of Jordan for over 46 years and during which he was an important actor in various Middle East conflicts. Just prior to his death, during an interview with [[CNN]]'s [[Christiane Amanpour]] Hussein expressed his opinion that a peaceful resolution would eventually be reached in the Arab-Israeli conflict.<ref>[[CNN]]/[[Time (magazine)|Time]] “Newsstand” Interviewer: [[Christiane Amanpour]].  24 January 2000</ref>

King Hussein's funeral was held on February 8, 1999 in the presence of all five of his sons, foreign dignitaries and statesmen, and an estimated 800,000 Jordanians.<ref>PBS NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, 1999 Online NewsHour</ref><ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20091021125839/http://geocities.com/dagtho/rg-jordankhussein1999.html Geocities.com]</ref> The [[UN General Assembly]] held an Emergency Special Session in "Tribute to the Memory of His Majesty the King of Jordan" on the same day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/eed216406b50bf6485256ce10072f637/50fcab40648861c0852569430054859e?OpenDocument |title=U.N.
