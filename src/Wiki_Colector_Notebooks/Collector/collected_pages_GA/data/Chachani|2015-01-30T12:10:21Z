'''Nevado Chachani''' is the highest of the mountains near the city of [[Arequipa]] in southern [[Peru]].

As a result of the very low precipitation in the Arequipa area, Chachani does not have a permanent ice cap or [[glacier]]s. Climbing Chachani is popular, and many tour agencies in Arequipa offer guided trips to the summit, though the altitude is considered highly challenging for those who are not fully acclimatized.
__NOTOC__

==Climbing routes==
[[File:Chachani November 2010.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Chachani from [[Arequipa]] in 2010]]
The mountain is normally climbed from its northern side. The start of the trek is at a drop-off point which is reached in 2.5 hours by four-wheel drive vehicle, driving west around Chachani and turning off from the main highway near [[Pampas Ca√±ahuas]], or heading north from Arequipa between Misti and Chachani. Base camp is at approximately {{convert|5,200|m}}. There is another higher camp called Camp Azulfrera situated at about {{convert|5,400|m}}. The route starts with the ascent to the Angel Col before traversing the El Angel mountain itself. Then climbers ascend the face of Fatima mountain in a zig-zag pattern before making another traverse on the Fatima mountain. Only then can the summit of Mount Chachani be seen. From there, climbers need to make the final ascent on the face of Chachani all the way to the top of the mountain.

The standard route requires [[crampons]] and an [[ice axe]], but does not require roping up, as there are no large [[crevasses]] on Chachani. Two traverses over relatively steep terrain constitute the main challenges on the way to the summit. The final push to the summit is a very steep{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=August 2014}} scree slope, which provides for a fast descent back to the first traverse.

In recent years,{{When|date=August 2014}} the amount of snow on Chachani has decreased dramatically, so for many months of the year there may be little snow on the mountain. For example, in October and November 2010, there was no snow at all, and the ascent could be made without crampons or ice axes. Climbers need to check on the snow conditions beforehand.

The average total climb time from base camp ranges from six to nine hours, with a two-to four-hour descent.
