'''Hussein bin Talal''' ({{lang-ar|حسين بن طلال}}, ''Ḥusayn ibn Ṭalāl''; 14 November 1935 – 7 February 1999) was [[King of Jordan]] from the abdication of his father, [[Talal of Jordan|King Talal]], on 11{{nbsp}}August 1952, until his death in 1999. According to Hussein, as a member of the [[Hashemite]] family, who have ruled Jordan since 1921, he was a [[Hashemites#Family tree|40th-generation direct descendant]] of [[Muhammad]].

He was born in [[Amman]] as the eldest child of Crown Prince Talal and his wife, Princess [[Zein Al-Sharaf Talal|Zein Al-Sharaf]]. Hussein began his schooling in Amman, continuing his education abroad. Fifteen-year-old Hussein witnessed the assassination of his grandfather [[Abdullah I of Jordan|King Abdullah I]] in Jerusalem in 1951. Hussein was named crown prince after his father became king. When Talal was forced to abdicate by [[Parliament of Jordan|Parliament]] a year after he became king due to illness, a Regency Council was appointed until Hussein came of age. He was enthroned at the age of 17 on 2{{nbsp}}May 1953. He was married four times separately and fathered eleven children: [[Princess Alia bint Hussein|Princess Alia]] from [[Dina bint Abdul-Hamid]]; [[Abdullah II of Jordan|Abdullah II]], [[Prince Faisal bin Hussein|Prince Faisal]], [[Princess Aisha bint Hussein|Princess Aisha]], and [[Princess Zein bint Hussein|Princess Zein]] from [[Antoinette Gardiner]]; [[Princess Haya bint Hussein|Princess Haya]] and [[Prince Ali bin Hussein|Prince Ali]] from [[Alia Touqan]]; [[Prince Hamzah bin Hussein|Prince Hamzah]], [[Prince Hashim bin Hussein|Prince Hashim]], [[Princess Iman bint Hussein|Princess Iman]], and [[Princess Raiyah bint Hussein|Princess Raiyah]] from [[Lisa Halaby]].

Hussein, a [[constitutional monarch]], started his rule with what was termed a "liberal experiment", allowing, in [[Jordanian general election, 1956|1956]], the formation of the only [[Suleiman Nabulsi's cabinet|democratically elected]] government in Jordan's history. Following an [[1957 alleged Jordanian military coup attempt|alleged coup attempt]] a few months later, he forced the government to resign, declaring [[martial law]] and banning political parties. Jordan fought three wars with [[Israel]] under Hussein, including the 1967 [[Six Day War]], which ended in Jordan's loss of the [[West Bank]]. In 1970 Hussein expelled to Lebanon Palestinian fighters ([[Palestinian fedayeen|fedayeen]]) based in Jordan after they had [[Dawson's Field hijackings|threatened]] the country's security in what became known as [[Black September in Jordan|Black September]]. The King [[Jordanian disengagement from the West Bank|renounced ties]] to the West Bank in 1988 after the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] was recognized internationally as the sole representative of the Palestinians. He lifted martial law and reintroduced [[Elections in Jordan|elections]] in [[Jordanian general election, 1989|1989]] after [[1989 Jordanian protests|riots over price hikes]] spread in southern Jordan, but the next year proposed to the parliament a controversial [[Single non-transferable vote|one-man, one-vote]] voting system. In 1994 he became the second Arab head of state to sign [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty|a peace treaty]] with Israel.

In 1952, when he was a 17-year old schoolboy, Hussein inherited a young kingdom that included the then [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordanian-controlled]] West Bank. The country had few natural resources, and a large Palestinian refugee population resulting from the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. Hussein led his country through four turbulent decades of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] and the [[Cold War]], successfully balancing pressures from [[Pan-Arabism|Arab nationalists]], [[Western countries]], and Israel, transforming Jordan by the end of his 46-year reign to a stable modern state. He was widely regarded as the [[Middle East]]'s peacemaker. He was revered for pardoning political dissidents and opponents, and giving them senior posts in the government. Hussein, who survived dozens of assassination attempts and plots to overthrow him, was the region's longest-reigning leader. The King died at the age of 63 from complications of cancer on 7{{nbsp}}February 1999. [[Death and state funeral of King Hussein|His funeral]] was the largest gathering of world leaders since 1995. He was succeeded by his eldest son [[Abdullah II of Jordan|Abdullah II]].

Since [[Abdullah I of Jordan|King Abdullah I]], the founder of modern Jordan, did not see in his two sons [[Talal of Jordan|Talal]] and [[Prince Nayef bin Abdullah|Nayef]] features of kingship, he focused his efforts on the upbringing of his grandson Hussein.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=44–45}} A special relationship grew between the two.

Egyptian president Nasser received an outpouring of support from the Arab public after the [[Egyptian–Czechoslovak arms deal]] was signed in September 1955, {{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=106-128}} and his popularity in Jordan skyrocketed following the nationalization of the [[Suez Canal]] in July 1956; his actions were seen as a powerful stance against Western [[imperialism]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=106–128}} Hussein was also supportive of the moves.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=106–128}} The coinciding events in Egypt had Jordanian leftist opposition parties leaning greatly towards Nasser.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=106-128}} The parliament that had been elected in 1954 was dissolved, and Hussein promised fair elections.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=106–128}} The parliamentary election held on [[Jordanian general election, 1956|21{{nbsp}}October 1956]] saw the [[National Socialist Party (Jordan)|National Socialist Party]] emerge as the largest party, winning 12 seats out of 40 in the House of Representatives.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=106–128}} Hussein subsequently asked [[Suleiman Nabulsi]], leader of the Party, to form a government, the only [[Suleiman Nabulsi's cabinet|democratically elected government]] in Jordan's history.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=106–128}} Hussein called this a "liberal experiment", to see how Jordanians would "react to responsibility".{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=106–128}} On 29{{nbsp}}October 1956 the [[Suez Crisis]] erupted in Egypt, a "tripartite aggression" by Britain, France, and Israel.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=106–128}} Hussein was furious but ultimately did not intervene.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=106–128}} Nabulsi's government was short-lived; its policies frequently clashed with King Hussein, including on how to deal with the [[Eisenhower Doctrine]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=106–128}} The King had requested Nabulsi, as prime minister, to crack down on the [[Jordanian Communist Party|Communist Party]] and the media it controlled.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=106–128}} Nabulsi wanted to move Jordan closer to Nasser's regime, but Hussein wanted it to stay in the Western camp.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=106–128}}[[File:King Hussein of Jordan among his troops 1 March 1957.png|thumb|right|Hussein receiving a warm welcome from his troops, 1{{nbsp}}March 1957]]

Disagreements between the monarchy and the leftist government culminated in March 1957 when Nabulsi provided Hussein with a list of senior officers in the military he wanted to dismiss; Hussein initially heeded the recommendations, but then Nabulsi presented a new list, which Hussein refused to act upon.{{sfn|Hiro|2003|p=352}} Nabulsi's government was forced to resign on 10{{nbsp}}April.{{sfn|Hiro|2003|p=352}} On 13{{nbsp}}April rioting broke in the [[Zarqa]] army barracks, and Hussein (age 21) went to end the violence between royalist and Arab nationalist army units after the latter group spread rumors that the King had been killed.{{sfn|Dann|1989|p=59}} A 3,000-man Syrian force started moving south in support of what they perceived as a coup attempt, but turned around after the army units showed their loyalty to the King.{{sfn|Shlaim|2007|p=135}} Two principal accounts emerged regarding the events at Zarqa, with the royalist version holding that the incident was an abortive coup by army chief of staff [[Ali Abu Nuwar]] against King Hussein, and the dissident version asserting that it was a staged, American-backed counter-coup by Hussein against the pan-Arabist movement in Jordan.{{sfn|Shlaim|2007|p=133}} In any case, Abu Nuwar and other senior Arabist officers resigned and were allowed to leave Jordan for Syria, where they incited opposition to the Jordanian monarchy.{{sfn|Shlaim|2007|p=133}} Hussein imposed [[martial law]] and disbanded Palestinian-dominated military units after the incident.{{sfn|Yitzhak|2012|p=125}} Although he eventually relaxed some of these measures, namely military curfews and severe press censorship, Hussein's moves significantly curtailed the constitutional democracy that existed in Jordan in the mid-1950s.{{sfn|Pearson|2010|p=110}} The alleged conspirators were sentenced to 15 years [[in absentia]], but later on were pardoned by Hussein in 1964 as part of his reconciliation efforts with his exiled opposition, and were given senior posts in the government.{{sfn|Pearson|2010|p=110}}

===Arab Federation between Iraq and Jordan===
{{Main|Arab Federation}}

The 1950s became known as the [[Arab Cold War]], due to the conflict between states led by Nasserist Egypt and traditionalist kingdoms led by Saudi Arabia.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=153–159}} Egypt and Syria formed the [[United Arab Republic]] (UAR) on 1{{nbsp}}February 1958, with the Republic's presidency occupied by Nasser.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=153–159}} As a counterweight, Hussein and his cousin [[Faisal II of Iraq|King Faisal II]] of [[Kingdom of Iraq|Hashemite Iraq]] established the [[Arab Federation]] on 14{{nbsp}}February 1958 in an Amman ceremony.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=153–159}} The two rival entities launched propaganda wars against each other through their radio broadcasts.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=153–159}} Jordanian and Syrian forces clashed in March along the border.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=153–159}} UAR-inspired conspiracies started to emerge against the Hashemite federation.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=157}} An officer in Jordan was arrested for plotting to assassinate Hussein.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=153–159}} It also emerged in Jordan that the UAR was planning to overthrow both Hashemite monarchies in July of 1958.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=153–159}} Jordan reacted by arresting 40 suspected army officers, and Hussein called in Iraqi army chief of staff Rafiq Aref to brief him on the exposed plot.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=153–159}} Aref replied "You look after yourselves. Iraq is a very stable country, unlike Jordan. If there is any worries it is Jordan that should be worried."{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=153–159}} Although Faisal and Hussein enjoyed a very close relationship, Faisal's Iraqi entourage looked down on Jordan; Hussein attributed this attitude to Iraqi crown prince [['Abd al-Ilah]]'s influence.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=153–159}}[[File:King Faisal and King Hussein 2 1957.png|thumb|right|Hussein with his cousin [[Faisal II of Iraq|King Faisal II]] (left) of the [[Kingdom of Iraq]], 1957. In February 1958, the two Hashemite Kingdoms formed the [[Arab Federation]] that lasted until Faisal was deposed in a bloody coup on [[14 July revolution|14 July 1958]].]]

The Lebanese pro-Western government of [[Camille Chamoun]] was also threatened to be toppled by growing UAR-supported domestic opposition groups.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=159–196}} The Iraqis sent a brigade to Jordan on 13{{nbsp}}July at Hussein's request.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=159–196}} The Iraqi brigade's departure to Jordan gave the conspirators in Iraq led by Brigadier [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] the opportunity to strike.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=159–196}} On [[14 July Revolution|14 July]] an Iraqi unit stormed the royal palace in Iraq, executed all members of the Iraqi royal family, and mutilated the bodies of the crown prince and the Iraqi prime minister of the Arab Federation, [[Nuri Al-Said]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=159–196}} Devastated, Hussein ordered a Jordanian expedition led by [[Sharif]] [[Hussein ibn Nasser|Nasser]] to reclaim the Iraqi throne,{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=159–196}} but it was recalled after it was {{convert|150|mi|0|adj=on}} inside Iraq.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=159–196}} Hussein, worried about a similar coup in Jordan, tightened [[martial law]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=159–196}} American troops landed in both Lebanon and Jordan as a show of support for pro-Western regimes in the region against the Nasserist tide.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=159–196}} By October the situation had calmed, and Western troops were recalled.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=159–196}} Hussein decided to go on a vacation to Switzerland on 10{{nbsp}}November. He was flying his own plane when it was intercepted by two Syrian jets that attempted to attack.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=159–196}} Hussein outmaneuvered the Syrians and survived the assassination attempt, landing safely in Amman, where he received a hero's welcome{{snd}}his popularity in Jordan skyrocketed overnight.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=159–196}} [[Golda Meir]], an Israeli politician who would later become prime minister, was reported in 1958 as saying: "We all pray three times a day for King Hussein's safety and success."{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=159–196}} The Israelis preferred that Hussein remained in power, rather than a Nasser-supported regime.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=159–196}}

In 1959 Hussein embarked on a tour to different countries to consolidate bilateral ties.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=174}} His visit to the United States gained him many friends in [[United States Congress|Congress]] after he spoke openly against Soviet influence in the Middle East, returning with a $50{{nbsp}}million aid package.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=174}} Sadiq Al-Shar'a, an army general who accompanied Hussein to the United States, was found to have been plotting a coup against the monarchy.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=174}} News of the arrest of the conspiring officers in Jordan coincided with Hussein's visit to the US.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=171}} Hussein was tipped off to Al-Shar'a's involvement, but did not reveal it until they both landed back in Jordan.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=174}} Al-Shar'a was tried and received the death penalty; Hussein reduced his sentence to life imprisonment.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=174}} Four years later, Al-Shar'a was pardoned and appointed director of Jordan's passport office.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=174}}

[[Hazza' Al-Majali]] was appointed by Hussein to form a government; it consisted of loyalists who had persuaded Hussein to launch an offensive against the Iraqi government to restore the Hashemite monarchy.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=176–184}} The expedition was cancelled amid British opposition and the weakened state of the [[Royal Jordanian Air Force]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=176–184}} UAR agents assassinated prime minister Al-Majali with a bomb planted in his office. Twenty minutes later another explosion went off;{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=176–184}} it was intended for Hussein as it was expected he would run to the scene, which he did{{snd}}he was a few minutes late.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=176–184}} Hussein, persuaded by [[Habis Al-Majali]], Hazza's cousin and the army chief of staff, prepared for a retaliation against Syria.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=176–184}} He prepared three brigades in the north, but the operation was called off after combined pressures from the Americans and the British.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=176–184}} Egyptian radios dismissed Hussein as the "Judas of the Arabs". Hussein would be subjected to several more assassination attempts.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=176–184}} One involved replacing his nose drops with strong acid. Another plot was uncovered after a large number of cats were found dead in the royal palace; it emerged that the cook had been trying poisons to use against the king.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=176–184}} Assassination attempts against the king subsided after [[1961 Syrian coup d'état|a successful coup]] toppled the Syrian regime on 28{{nbsp}}September 1961 and the UAR collapsed.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=176–184}} With a calmed situation in Jordan, the King issued his slogan "Let us build this country to serve this nation."{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=176–184}} But critics considered the slogan mere lip service, saying Hussein showed little interest in the economic situation of the country, unlike the military and foreign relations aspects.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=176–184}}

In January 1962 [[Wasfi Al-Tal]] was appointed prime minister.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=185–218}} The controversial young politician who worked to bring sweeping reforms resigned after Hussein sought to solidify his position following the rise of the Nasser-supporting [[Ba'ath party]] to the governments of Iraq and Syria in [[1963 Syrian coup d'état|two 1963 coups]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=185–218}} The first direct contacts between Jordan and Israel started in early 1960s; Hussein had a Jewish doctor named Emmanuel Herbert who acted as intermediary between the two nations during Hussein's visits to London.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=185–218}} In the talks, Hussein highlighted his commitment to a peaceful resolution to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=185–218}} His secret rapprochement with Israel was followed by a public rapprochement with Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1964, which bolstered Hussein's popularity both in Jordan and in the Arab world.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=185–218}} Hussein received a warm welcome after visiting West Bank cities afterwards.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=185–218}} The rapprochement with Nasser happened during the [[1964 Arab League summit (Cairo)|1964 Arab League summit]] in Cairo, where the [[Palestine Liberation Army]] (PLA) and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) were established, and where Jordan agreed to join the [[United Arab Command]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=185–218}} During the summit Nasser also attempted to convince Hussein to purchase Soviet weapons, but the Americans provided Hussein with tanks and jets instead, with the understanding that they would not be used in the West Bank at Israel's request.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=185–218}} The PLO identified itself as a representative of the Palestinian people, which clashed with Jordan's sovereignty claim over the West Bank.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=185–218}} The PLO started to demand that the Jordanian government legalize their activities, including the setting up of Palestinian armed units to fight Israel; the requests were denied.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=185–218}}

{{quote box
| quote  = with the passage of years one realized we were not talking about a country hundreds of miles away. We were talking about a people and a country with a destiny, both of us. We were in a very small region and we had to figure out how we could resolve our problems. If we look at water, it was a problem that both of us suffered from. If we look at even a flu epidemic, it affected both of us. Every aspect of life was interrelated and interlinked in some way or another. And to simply ignore that was something I could not understand. Maybe others could, others who were distant, who were not equally aware or involved. By now there were Palestinians and Jordanians, and their rights, their future was at stake. One had to do something; one had to explore what was possible and what was not.

The events at Samu triggered large-scale anti-Hashemite protests in the West Bank for what they perceieved as Hussein's incompetency for defending them against Israel: rioters attacked government offices, chanted pro-Nasser slogans, and called on Hussein to have the same fate as [[Nuri As-Said]]{{snd}}the Iraqi prime minister who had been killed and mutilated in 1958 along with the Iraqi royal family.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=226–240}} Jordanians believed that after this incident, Israel would march on the West Bank whether or not Jordan joined the war.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=226–240}} Perception of King Hussein's efforts to come to peaceful terms with Israel led to great dissatisfaction among some Arab leaders.<ref name="bbc onthisday"/> President Nasser of Egypt denounced Hussein as an "imperialist lackey".<ref name="bbc onthisday">BBC on this Day, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/30/newsid_2493000/2493177.stm Egypt and Jordan unite against Israel].

On 5 June 1967 the [[Six-Day War]] began after an Israeli strike wiped out [[Egyptian Air Force|Egypt's Air Force]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=241–245}} The Egyptian army commander in Cairo transmitted to General Riad that the Israeli strike had failed, and that [[Israeli Air Force|Israel's Air Force]] was almost wiped out.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=241–245}} Based on the information from Cairo, Riad ordered the Jordanian army to take offensive positions and attack Israeli targets around [[Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=241–245}} Jordanian [[Hawker Hunters]] made sorties but were destroyed by Israel when they went to refuel; Syria's and Iraq's air forces followed.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=241–245}} Israel's air superiority on the first day of war proved decisive.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=241–245}} Two Israeli jets attempted to assassinate Hussein; one was shot down by anti-aircraft artillery, and the other shot directly at Hussein's office in the royal palace.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=241–245}} Hussein was not there, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] director in Amman [[Jack O'Connell (diplomat)|Jack O'Connell]] relayed a message threatening the Israelis, and the attempts stopped.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=241–245}} The Jordanians had prepared a war strategy, but the Egyptian commander preferred to build his strategy based on information from Egypt.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=241–245}}

By 7 June fighting led the Jordanians to withdraw from the West Bank, and Jerusalem's [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] and the [[Dome of the Rock]] were abandoned after desperate fighting.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=243–255}} Israel blew up the bridges between the two banks to consolidate its control.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=243–255}} Jordan suffered a severe setback with the loss of the West Bank, which contributed 40% to Jordan's GDP in the tourism, industrial, and agricultural sectors.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=243–255}} Around 200,000 Palestinian refugees fled to Jordan, destablizing Jordan's demographics.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=243–255}} The loss of Jerusalem was critical to Jordan, and specifically for Hussein who held the [[Hashemite custodianship of Jerusalem holy sites|Hashemite custodianship of Muslim and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=243–255}} Al-Aqsa mosque is the third holiest site in Islam, believed to be where [[Muhammad]] ascended to heaven.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=243–255}} By 11{{nbsp}}June Israel had decisively won the war by capturing the West Bank from Jordan, [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and the [[Sinai]] from Egypt, and the [[Golan Heights]] from Syria.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=243–255}} Nasser and Hussein, recognizing their defeat, sought to work together towards a more moderate stance.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=243–255}}

On 17 September the Jordanian army surrounded cities that had a PLO presence, including Amman and [[Irbid]], and began shelling the fedayeen, who had established themselves in Palestinian refugee camps.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=311–340}} The next day, a force from Syria with PLO markings started advancing towards Irbid, which the fedayeen declared a "liberated" city.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=311–340}} On 22{{nbsp}}September, the Syrians withdrew after the Jordanian army launched an air-ground offensive that inflicted heavy Syrian losses, and after Israeli Air Force jets flew over Syrian units in a symbolic show of support of Hussein, but did not engage.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=311–340}} An agreement brokered by Egyptian president Nasser between Arafat and Hussein led to an end to the fighting on 27{{nbsp}}September.

Jordan allowed the fedayeen to leave for Lebanon through Syria, an event that led to the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1975.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=311–340}} The [[Black September Organization]] was founded the same year, named after the conflict.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=311–340}} The organization claimed responsibility for the assassination of Jordanian prime minister [[Wasfi Al-Tal]] in 1971, and the highly publicized 1972 [[Munich massacre]] against Israeli athletes.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=311–340}}

In a speech to the Jordanian parliament on 15{{nbsp}}March 1972, Hussein announced his "[[King Hussein's federation plan|United Arab Kingdom]]" plan.{{sfn|Salibi|2006|p=251–252}} Unlike the [[unitary state]] that had existed between the West Bank and Jordan during [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordan's annexation of the West Bank]] (1950–1967), this plan envisaged two [[Federation|federal]] entities on each bank of the Jordan River.{{sfn|Salibi|2006|p=251–252}} According to the proposal, the two districts of the federation would be autonomous, excluding the military and the foreign and security affairs that would be determined by an Amman central government.{{sfn|Salibi|2006|p=251–252}} But the implementation of the plan was to be conditional upon achieving a peace agreement between Israel and Jordan.{{sfn|Salibi|2006|p=251–252}} Ultimately, Hussein's proposal was ruled out after it was vehemently rejected by Israel, the PLO, and several Arab states.{{sfn|Salibi|2006|p=251–252}}

In the [[1974 Arab League summit]] held in Morocco on 26{{nbsp}}October, a Fatah plot to assassinate Hussein upon his arrival was uncovered by the Moroccan authorities.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=363–384}} The plot did not deter Hussein from joining the summit, but at the end Jordan had to join all the Arab countries in recognizing the PLO as "the sole representative of the Palestinian people", a diplomatic defeat for Hussein.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=363–384}} The relationship between Jordan and the United States deteriorated when Jordan refused to join the [[Camp David Accords]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=405–411}} The Accords formed the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, and allowed the withdrawal of Israel from the Sinai.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=405–411}} In 1978 Hussein went to Baghdad for the first time since 1958; there, he met Iraqi politician [[Saddam Hussein]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=405–411}} When Saddam became president of Iraq in 1979, Hussein supported Saddam's [[Iran–Iraq War]] that stretched from 1980 to 1988.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=405–411}} The relationship grew as Saddam provided Jordan with subsidized oil, and Jordan allowed Iraq to use the [[Port of Aqaba]] for its exports.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=405–411}}

In 1983 American president [[Ronald Reagan]] suggested a peace plan that became known as the Reagan plan, similar to Hussein's 1972 federation plan.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=425–438}} Hussein and Arafat both agreed to the plan on 1{{nbsp}}April, but the PLO's executive office rejected it.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=425–438}} A year and a half later, a renewed effort by Hussein to jumpstart the peace process culminated in the establishment of a Jordan–PLO accord that sought a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, an unprecedented milestone for the PLO and a Jordanian diplomatic victory.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=425–438}} The accord was opposed by Israel and garnered no international support from either the United States or the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=425–438}} Around the same time, Hussein met Israel prime minister [[Shimon Peres]] on 19{{nbsp}}July 1985 in the United Kingdom, where Peres assented to the accord, but later the rest of his government opposed it due to the PLO's involvement.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=425–438}} Subsequent talks between the PLO and Jordan collapsed after the PLO refused to make concessions; in a speech Hussein announced that "after two long attempts, I and the government of Jordan hereby announce that we are unable to continue to coordinate politically with the PLO leadership until such time as their word becomes their bond, characterized by commitment, credibility and constancy."{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=425–438}}

Jordan started a crackdown on the PLO by closing their offices in Amman after the then Israeli minister of defense, Yitzhak Rabin, requested it from Hussein in a secret meeting.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=425–438}} Jordan announced a $1.3{{nbsp}}billion five-year development plan for the West Bank, in a bid to enhance its image in the West Bank residents at the expense of the PLO.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=425–438}} Around the same time, Hussein became troubled after he heard that Israel had been selling American weapons to Iran, thereby lengthening the conflict between Iraq and Iran, both supporters of the PLO.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=425–438}} The relationship between Hussein and Saddam became very close{{snd}}Hussein visited Baghdad 61 times between 1980 and 1990,{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=425–438}} and Saddam used Hussein to relay messages to several countries, including the US and Britain.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=425–438}} In June 1982, after Iran's victory seemed imminent, Hussein personally carried to Saddam sensitive photographic intelligence forwarded to him by the US.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=425–438}} In return, Saddam provided incentives for Jordanian exports to Iraq, which accounted for a quarter of all Jordan's exports, valued at $212.3{{nbsp}}million in 1989.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=425–438}} Iraqi aid helped Jordan's finances; Hussein had felt it humiliating to keep asking [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf countries]] for assistance.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=425–438}} Hussein made a little-known attempt to heal the rift between the two [[Ba'ath]] regimes of Iraq and Syria in April 1986.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=425–438}} The meeting between Hafez Al-Assad and Saddam Hussein occurred at an airbase in [[Al-Jafr, Jordan|Al-Jafr]] in the eastern Jordanian desert.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=425–438}} The talks lasted for a day, after which no progress was made.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=425–438}} Saddam was angry at Al-Assad for supporting Iran against an Arab country, Iraq,{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=425–438}} and Al-Assad was adamant about establishing a union between Iraq and Syria, which Saddam rejected.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=425–438}}

On 11 April 1987, after [[Yitzhak Shamir]] became prime minister of Israel, Hussein engaged in direct talks with Shamir's foreign minister, Peres, in London.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=440–452}} After reaching an agreement between Hussein and Peres on establishing an international peace conference, Shamir and the rest of the ministers in his cabinet rejected the proposal.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=440–452}} On [[1987 Arab League summit|8{{nbsp}}November 1987]] Jordan hosted an Arab League summit; Hussein enjoyed good relations with rival Arab blocs, and he acted as conciliatory intermediate.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=440–452}} He helped mobilize Arab support for Iraq against Iran, and for Jordan's peace efforts, and helped to end the decade-long Arab boycott of Egypt{{snd}}a boycott that began after it unilaterally signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=440–452}} Hussein described the summit as one of the best moments in his life.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=440–452}}

On 9 December 1987 an Israeli truck driver ran over four Palestinians in a [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] refugee camp, sparking unrest that spread to violent demonstrations in the West Bank.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=453–467}} What began as an uprising to achieve Palestinian independence against the Israeli occupation turned into an upsurge of support for the PLO, which had orchestrated the uprising, and consequently diminished Jordanian influence in the West Bank.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=453–467}} Jordanian policy on the West Bank had to be reconsidered following renewed fears that Israel would revive its proposal for Jordan to become an "alternative Palestinian homeland".{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=453–467}} US Secretary of State [[George P.

The orchestrators of the Intifada were the [[Unified National Leadership of the Uprising]], which issued its 10th communiqué on 11{{nbsp}}March 1988, urging its followers to "intensify the mass pressure against the [Israel] occupation army and the settlers and against collaborators and personnel of the Jordanian regime".{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=453–467}} West Bank Palestinians deviation from the Jordanian state highlighted the need for a revision in Jordan's policy, and [[Jordanian nationalism|Jordanian nationalists]] began to argue that Jordan would be better off without the Palestinians and without the West Bank.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=453–467}} Adnan Abu Oudeh, a Palestinian descendant who was Hussein's political advisor, Prime Minister [[Zaid Al-Rifai]], army chief of staff [[Zaid ibn Shaker]], [[The Royal Hashemite Court|royal court]] chief Marwan Kasim, and mukhabarat director Tariq Alaeddin, helped the King prepare West Bank disengagement plans.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=453–467}} The Jordanian Ministry of Occupied Territories Affairs was abolished on 1{{nbsp}}July 1988, its responsibilities taken over by the Palestinian Affairs Department.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=453–467}} On 28{{nbsp}}July Jordan terminated the West Bank development plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/29/world/jordan-drops-1.3-billion-plan-for-west-bank-development.html|title=Jordan Drops $1.3 Billion Plan For West Bank Development|work=AP|accessdate=1 September 2017|date=29 July 1988|publisher=The New York Times}}</ref> Two days later a royal decree dissolved the [[Jordanian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], thereby removing West Bank representation in the Parliament.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=453–467}} In a televised speech on 1{{nbsp}}August, Hussein announced the "severing of Jordan's legal and administrative ties with the West Bank", essentially surrending claims of sovereignty over the West Bank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/01/world/hussein-surrenders-claims-west-bank-plo-us-peace-plan-jeopardy-internal-tensions.html|title=Hussein surrenders claims on West Bank to the PLO, U.S. peace plan in jeopardy|author=John Kifner|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=3 September 2017|date=1 August 1988}}</ref> The move revoked the Jordanian citizenship of Palestinians in the West Bank (who had obtained it since Jordan annexed the territory in 1950), but not that of Palestinians residing in Jordan.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=453–467}} Nevertheless, the Hashemite custodianship over the Muslim and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem was retained.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=453–467}} Israeli politicians were stunned, thinking it was a political manoeuvre so that the Palestinians could show support for Hussein, but later realized that it represented a shift in Jordan's policy after Hussein asked his West Bank supporters not to issue petitions demanding that he relent.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=453–467}} In a meeting in November 1988 the PLO accepted all United Nations resolutions and agreed to recognize Israel.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=453–467}}

Jordan participated in the imposition of economic sanctions against Iraq even though the sanctions would severely affect its economy.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=478–506}} The effects of the Gulf War, the sanctions on Iraq, and the flow of refugees to Jordan were estimated by a UN report to be $1.5{{nbsp}}billion out of a [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of $4.2{{nbsp}}billion in 1990, and $3.6{{nbsp}}billion out of a GDP of $4.7{{nbsp}}billion in 1991.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507–531}} The end of the Gulf War coincided with the end of the Cold War.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507–531}} This allowed the United States to play a more active role in solving the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507–531}} The Bush administration were still angry at Hussein for the Gulf War events but realized they needed Jordan's participation in any peace process.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507–531}} Hussein agreed to an American request to join an international peace conference so that Jordan could start repairing its relationship with the United States, and end its political isolation.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507–531}} Hussein's moves towards democratization 1989 and his stance during the 1990 Gulf War had won him considerable popularity across Jordan's political spectrum.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507–531}} But when Hussein replaced his conservative prime minister, [[Mudar Badran]], with liberal Palestinian [[Taher Al-Masri]], who was in favor of peace negotiations with Israel, the [[Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood|Muslim Brotherhood]]{{snd}}Jordan's main opposition group, who at that time occupied 22 out of 80 seats in the [[House of Representatives]], and whose members and support came mostly from Palestinians in the country{{snd}}vehemently rejected the new prime minister by voting against him during the [[vote of confidence]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507–531}} The Brotherhood also refused to participate in the National Congress where the King hoped to gather support for a peace settlement.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507–531}}

Hussein was tasked by the United States with forming a joint Palestinian-Jordanian delegation to participate in the [[Madrid Conference of 1991|Madrid Peace Conference]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507–531}} The 28-member delegation consisted of 14 Jordanians and 14 Palestinians.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507–531}} Along with solving the Palestinian problem, Jordan sought to safeguard its interests in relation to security, the economy, water, and the environment.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507–531}} The peace conference convened on 30{{nbsp}}October 1991, with delegations representing all parties to the conflict, the United States and the Soviet Union as co-sponsors, and the United Nations as observer.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507–531}} The conference set a framework for negotiations, and PLO representatives offered to accept a Palestinian state under a [[confederation]] with Jordan.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507–531}} At home, the Muslim Brotherhood considered Al-Masri and his government as too liberal and leftist, and the Brotherhood merged with independent Islamists and formed the [[Islamic Action Front]] (IAF), increasing its representation to 34 in the 80-member House of Representative, a force strong enough to bring down the royally appointed government with a motion of a [[vote of no confidence]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507–531}} Hussein then replaced Al-Masri with his conservative cousin [[Zaid ibn Shaker]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507–531}} Subsequent peace talks continued in [[Washington, D.C.]], stretching from December 1991 to September 1993.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507-531}}[[File:Hussein Clinton Rabin.jpg|thumb|right|Hussein shakes hands with Israeli prime minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] during the Washington declaration that ended the "state of belligerency" as American president [[Bill Clinton]] observes, 13{{nbsp}}September 1994.]]

Hussein could not participate in the details of the talks, a task he handed to his brother Hassan.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507–531}} Hussein was referred to the [[Mayo Clinic]] in the United States after having urological problems; he had his left kidney removed after tests showed his [[ureter]] contained precancerous cells.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507–531}} When Hussein went back healed to Jordan, he received a hero's welcome{{snd}}a third of Jordan's population filled the streets to greet him.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507–531}} On 23{{nbsp}}November 1992 he gave an unusually aggressive speech.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507–531}} He called on extremists on both the right and left of the political spectrum to end their opposition to the peace negotiations, denounced what he saw as the Gulf countries' undemocratic nature, and called on Saddam to introduce democracy to Iraq.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507–531}} Meanwhile, Yitzhak Rabin, under the leftist [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]], emerged as prime minister of Israel.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507–531}} Thus, the PLO and Israeli representatives were quick to reach an agreement, which culminated in the 1993 [[Oslo Accords]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507–531}} The Accords were held in secrecy between Arafat and Rabin without Hussein's knowledge, completely marginalizing Jordan and the Palestinian-Jordanian delegation in Washington.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=507–531}}

The parliamentary elections held on [[Jordanian general election, 1993|8{{nbsp}}November 1993]] were the first [[multi-party elections]] since 1956, but the [[proportional representation]] voting system was replaced by the controversial [[one man, one vote]] system.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=532–546}} The latter system was introduced to limit the Islamist opposition's representation in the House of Representatives, by [[gerrymandering]] Palestinian majority areas and encouraging [[Independent (politics)|independents]] over [[Partisan (political)|partisan]] candidates.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=532–546}} Consequently, the IAF's seats decreased from 34 to 21 seats out of 80.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=532–546}} On 25{{nbsp}}July 1994 Rabin and Hussein appeared at the [[White House]] and signed the Washington declaration, which announced the "end of the state of belligerency".{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=532–546}} Subsequent negotiations culminated in the [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty]], signed on 26{{nbsp}}October in a ceremony in [[Wadi Araba]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=532–546}} The treaty was a culmination of over 58 secret meetings over 31 years between Hussein and Israeli leaders.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=532–546}} The treaty recognized Jordan's role in Jerusalem's holy sites, which angered Arafat who had sought such a position.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=532–546}} Jordan's relations with the United States greatly improved: $700{{nbsp}}million worth of Jordan's debt was forgiven by the [[United States Congress]], and [[Bill Clinton]]'s administration authorized a substantial flow of aid to Jordan.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=532–546}}

After 1995 Hussein became increasingly critical of Saddam's rule in Iraq.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=532–546}} On 4{{nbsp}}November 1995 [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated]] by a Jewish extremist, who aimed to undermine Rabin's peace efforts with the Palestinians.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=532–546}} Due to the close relationship forged with Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin during the negotiations of the treaty, Hussein was invited to give a speech during Rabin's funeral.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=532–546}} The funeral, held in Jerusalem, was the first time Hussein had been in Jerusalem since 1967.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=532–546}} Hussein drew parallels between Rabin's assassination and his grandfather's assassination in 1951: "We are not ashamed, nor are we afraid, nor are we anything but determined to continue the legacy for which my friend fell, as did my grandfather in this city when I was with him and but a boy."{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=532–546}}

Jordan's signing of a peace treaty with Israel, and other issues, were met with disdain by Syria's president [[Hafez Al-Assad]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=547–560}} The CIA handed the King a detailed report in December 1995 warning him of a Syrian plot to assassinate him and his brother Hassan.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=547–560}} A month later, the CIA sent Hussein another report warning Jordan of Iraqi plots to attack Western targets in Jordan to undermine Jordan's security due to its support for the Iraqi opposition.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=547–560}} In Israel, Shimon Peres of the leftist Labor Party and [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] of the right-wing [[Likud]] party, were competing for the post of prime minister.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=547–560}} Hussein's popularity in Israel had peaked after the peace treaty was signed, and he was expected to express support for a candidate.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=547–560}} Hussein initially remained neutral, but invited Netanyahu to Amman on elections eve.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=547–560}} The Israeli general election held on [[Israeli general election, 1996|29{{nbsp}}May 1996]] witnessed Netanyahu's ascension to the prime ministry.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=547–560}}

Hussein's support for Netanyahu soon backfired.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}} Israel's actions during the 1996 [[Qana massacre]] in Southern Lebanon, the Likud government's decision to build settlements in [[East Jerusalem]], and the events at the [[Temple Mount]] where clashes between Palestinian and Israeli police ensued after Israeli tunnel diggings around the Mount, generated an uproar of criticism for Netanyahu in the Arab World.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}} On 9{{nbsp}}March 1997 Hussein sent Netanyahu a three-page letter expressing his disappointment.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}}

Four days later, on 13{{nbsp}}March, a Jordanian soldier patrolling the borders between Jordan and Israel in the north near the [[Island of Peace]], [[Island of Peace massacre|shot seven Israeli schoolgirls]] and wounded six others.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}} The King, who was on an official visit to Spain, returned home immediately.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}} He personally travelled to the Israeli town of [[Beit Shemesh]] to offer his condolences to the families of the Israeli children killed.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}} He went on his knees in front of the families.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}} His gesture was received very warmly in Israel, and Hussein sent the families $1{{nbsp}}million in total as compensation for the loss of life.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}} The soldier was determined to be mentally unstable by a Jordanian military tribunal and was sentenced to 20{{nbsp}}years in prison, which he served entirely.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}} Clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian militant groups in Gaza and the West Bank surfaced.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}} Hussein's wife then, [[Queen Noor of Jordan|Queen Nour]], later claimed her husband was having trouble sleeping: "Everything he had worked for all his life, every relationship he had painstakingly built on trust and respect, every dream of peace and prosperity he had had for Jordan's children, was turning into a nightmare. I really did not know how much more Hussein could take."{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}}
 
On 27 September 1997 eight [[Mossad]] (Israeli intelligence agency) agents entered Jordan using fake Canadian passports and attempted to assassinate Jordanian citizen [[Khaled Mashal]], head of the militant Islamist Palestinian group [[Hamas]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}} Hussein was actually preparing for a 30-year Hamas–Israel truce three days prior to the attempt after Hamas had launched two attacks in Jerusalem.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}} Two Mossad agents followed Mashal to his office and injected poison into his ears, but they were caught by Mashal's bodyguard.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}} The two agents were then held by the Jordanian police, while the six other agents hid in the Israeli embassy.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}} Furious, Hussein met with an Israeli delegate who attempted to explain the situation; the King said in a speech about the incident that he felt that somebody "had spat in his face".{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}} Jordanian authorities requested Netanyahu to provide an antidote to save Mashal's life, but Netanyahu refused to do so.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}} Jordan then threatened to storm the Israeli embassy and capture the rest of the Mossad team, but Israel argued that it would be against the [[Geneva Conventions]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}} Jordan replied that the Geneva Conventions "do not apply to terrorists", and a [[Joint Special Operations Command (Jordan)|special operations]] team headed by Hussein's son [[Abdullah II of Jordan|Abdullah]] was put in charge of the operation.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}} Hussein called American president Clinton and requested his intervention, threatening to annul the treaty if Israel did not provide the antidote.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}} Clinton later managed to get Israel's approval to reveal the name of the antidote, and said about Netanyahu "this man is impossible!"{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}} Khaled Mashal recovered, but Jordan's relations with Israel deteriorated and Israeli requests to contact Hussein were rebuffed.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}} The Mossad operatives were released by Jordan after Israel agreed to release 23 Jordanian and 50 Palestinian prisoners including Sheikh [[Ahmed Yassin]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}}

Mounting opposition to the peace treaty in Jordan led Hussein to put greater restrictions on [[freedom of speech]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}} The crackdown led the opposition groups in Jordan to boycott the [[Jordanian general election, 1997|1997 parliamentary elections]].{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}} In 1998 Jordan refused a secret request from Netanyahu to attack Iraq using Jordanian airspace after claiming Saddam held weapons of mass destruction.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=560–581}}

Israeli writer [[Avi Shlaim]] sees that the assassination of Hussein's grandfather [[Abdullah I of Jordan|King Abdullah{{nbsp}}I]] in Jerusalem was the most formative event in Hussein's life, as he had witnessed the event personally at the age of 15.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=609–616}} Two years later, the 17-year old schoolboy would become King.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=609–616}} Hussein inherited a young Kingdom, whose neighbors questioned its right to exist, along with the Jordanian-controlled West Bank.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=609–616}} From an early age he had to shoulder a heavy responsibility.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=609–616}} The Kingdom had few natural resources, and a large Palestinian refugee population.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=609–616}} He was able to gain his country considerable political weight on a global scale despite its limited potential.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=609–616}} Hussein was able to survive through four turbulent decades of the [[Arab-Israel conflict]] and the Cold War, successfully balancing pressures from [[Pan-Arabism|Arab nationalists]], and Western countries and Israel.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=609–616}}

Hussein considered the Palestinian issue to be the overriding national security issue, even after Jordan lost the West Bank in 1967 and after it renounced claims to it in 1988.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=609–616}} Initially, Hussein attempted to unite both banks of the Jordan River as one people, but with the formation of the PLO in the 1960s, it became difficult to maintain such a policy.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=609–616}} He was relentless in pursuit of peace, viewing that the only way to solve the conflict was by peaceful means, excluding his decision to join the war in 1967.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=609–616}} The decision cost him half his kingdom and his grandfather's legacy.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=609–616}} After the war he emerged as an advocate for Palestinian statehood.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=609–616}} After renouncing ties to the West Bank in 1988, he remained committed to solving the conflict.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=609–616}} His 58 secret meetings held with Israeli representatives since 1963 culminated in the signing of the Israel–Jordan peace treaty in 1994, which he considered to be his "crowning achievement".{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=609–616}}

Hussein's policy of co-opting the opposition was his most revered.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=609–616}} He was the region's longest reigning leader, even though he was subject to dozens of assassination attempts and plots to overthrow him.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=609–616}} He was known to pardon political opponents and dissidents, including those who had attempted to assassinate him.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=609–616}} He gave some of them senior posts in the government.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=609–616}} He is described as having been a "[[benign dictatorship|benign authoritarian]]".<ref name="encoleg"/>[[File:Hussein 1950s.jpg|thumb|right|Hussein inaugurating the [[King Abdullah Canal|East Ghor Canal]] in 1961]]

The King disliked paperwork, and had no solid view for the economy.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=609–616}} He was dubbed the "fundraiser-in-chief": throughout his reign he managed to obtain foreign aid from different sources, leaving a legacy of a foreign aid-dependent Jordan.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=609–616}} British aid in the early 1950s, American aid from 1957 onwards, Gulf aid in the 1960s and 1970s, Arab League and Iraqi aid in the early 1980s, and, after formalizing peace with Israel, American aid in the 1990s.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=609–616}} He was also seen as too lenient toward some ministers who were alleged to be corrupt.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=473}} The price of establishing peace with Israel he had to pay domestically, with mounting Jordanian opposition to Israel concentrating its criticism on the King.{{sfn|Shlaim|2008|p=609–616}} The King reacted by introducing restrictions on freedom of speech, and changing the electoral law into the one-man, one-vote system in a bid to increase representation from independent regime loyalists and tribal groups at the expense of Islamist and partisan candidates.<ref name="encoleg"/> The moves impeded Jordan's path towards democracy that had started in 1956 and resumed in 1989.<ref name="encoleg"/>
