'''Chachani''' is the highest of the mountains near the city of [[Arequipa]] in southern [[Peru]].

As a result of the very low precipitation in the Arequipa area, Chachani does not have a permanent ice cap or [[glacier]]s. Climbing Chachani is popular, and many tour agencies in Arequipa offer guided trips to the summit, though the altitude is considered highly challenging for those who are not fully acclimatized.

== Geology ==
Between six and eight separate craters form the massif of Chachani. Erosion has only left one recognizable crater in the western part of the complex.<ref name="Bullard1962" /> This structure has an arcuate shape.<ref name="SilvaFrancis1990" /> A shield {{convert|1|km}} thick with a diameter of {{convert|8|km}} is formed from coalescent lava flows on Chachani's southern side and is known as Pampa de Palacio or  Las Cortaderas.<ref name="SilvaFrancis1990" /> An escarpment on the eastern side of Chachani may be part of a "Chachani" [[caldera]], the source of several ignimbrites in the Arequipa area.<ref name="LebtiThouret2006" /> Vegetation cover above {{convert|4500|m}} altitude is scarce.<ref name="AndresPalacios2011" /> Chachani is the eighty-four highest summit of the Andes.<ref name="GalasPanajew2014" />

Chachani is largely [[Quaternary]] in origin,<ref name="PallaresFabre2015" /> Cerro Nocarane and the Penones lava dome predate the ice ages.<ref name="SilvaFrancis1990" /> Activity of Chachani has migrated southward, from the Nocarane-Chingana volcanoes in the north to a complex of lava flows and lava domes in the south.<ref name="AlcalaZamorano2012" /> Volcanic activity in the area began as Tacaza volcanics during the [[Miocene]]. During the Sillapaca phase starting in the [[Pliocene]] the cone building volcanism took place. By its end explosive eruptions generated voluminous rhyolitic tuffs named ''sillar''.<ref name="Bullard1962" />

Several [[ignimbrite]]s in the Arequipa area appear to have been erupted from beneath Chachani. This includes the {{convert|18|-|20|km3}} Arequipa Airport Ignimbrite and {{convert|16|-|24|km3}} La Joya Ignimbrite. These Pliocene ignimbrites are dated 1.64 ± 0.07 mya and 4.87 ± 0.02 mya. The eruption of these ignimbrites would have left a caldera, now completely buried beneath the Chachani complex. The 1.02 ± 0.09 [[mya (unit)|mya]] Rio Yura tuffs were probably erupted from beneath Nocarane.<ref name="LebtiThouret2006" /><ref name="PaquereauRoperch2003" />

Later activity generated basaltic lava flows on Chachani's southwest side, in valleys eroded in the tuffs. There, the {{convert|1200|m}} high Pampa de Palacio/Las Cortaderas [[lava dome]]s were formed by highly viscous [[andesitic]] lavas. They are well preserved, indicating a young age. It is believed the end of Chachani's eruptive activity happened simultaneously or closely preceded the start of activity of [[El Misti]].<ref name="SilvaFrancis1990" /><ref name="Bullard1962" /> Some thin lava flows from the central and western parts of the volcano run above moraines. 
[[File:Chachani summit edited.jpg|left|thumb|256x256px|The summit (on the left) and the path leading to it in October 2007.]]
The Cerro La Horqueta [[cinder cone]] may be the youngest vent of Chachani.<ref name="SilvaFrancis1990" /> Between 70,000 and 50,000 years ago ashfall deposits from El Misti were deposited on Chachani's southeastern flank.<ref name="ThouretFinizola2001" /> A 270,000 ± 80,000 year old dacitic lava flow on Chachani's eastern flank is more likely to come from Chachani than El Misti, as are ash fall deposits found on top of this lava (which is thus older) and covering Chachani's flanks.<ref name="Legros2001" /> Geothermal activity is found today at Chachani,<ref name="DeggChester2005" /> and solfataras were observed in 2012 in the summit area.<ref name="GalasPanajew2014" />

Two normal [[fault (geology)|fault]]s run beneath Chachani. Active [[El Misti]], the extinct [[Pichu Pichu]] and possibly [[Ampato]] volcanoes are located along one of these fault zones. This fault zone has been active in the Holocene with a left-lateral offset. The formation of these volcanic centres may have been induced by the fault zone.<ref name="FinizolaLenat2004" /><ref name="BirnieHall1974" />

The Pliocene ignimbrites contain [[biotite]], [[ilmenite]], [[magnetite]], [[plagioclase]], [[quartz]], [[sanidine]] and sometimes [[amphibole]].<ref name="PaquereauRoperch2003" />

[[Pyroclastic flow]]s and [[mudflow]]s from Chachani are a potential threat to [[Arequipa]], especially its western suburban area. Less than {{convert|25|km}} separate it from the {{convert|3000|m}} higher Chachani.<ref name="SilvaFrancis1990" />

== Glaciation ==
The volcano was glaciated during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (LGM) and then again during the [[Little Ice Age]] (LIA). There are no present day glaciers on Chachani.<ref name="AlcalaZamorano2012" /> The glaciation covered a large surface area in the past.<ref name="UbedaYoshikawa2015" />

[[Moraine]]s from the LGM are found at {{convert|3150|-|3600|m}} altitude and LIA moraines at {{convert|5100|-|5300|m}} altitude.<ref name="AlcalaZamorano2012" />

Ash and pumice reworked by water from El Misti have been found in probably glacially carved valleys on Chachani's southeastern side. This reworking may have happened between 24,000 and 12,000 years ago.<ref name="ThouretFinizola2001" />

Glacial erosion has left [[cirque]]s and U-valleys on Chachani.<ref name="Bullard1962" />

Beneath rock walls, possibly active [[rock glacier]]s are found at altitudes {{convert|4300|-|5400|m}} at Nocarane and {{convert|4350|-|5100|m}} on Chachani.<ref name="AlcalaZamorano2012" /> On Nocarane, three different stages of rock glacier activity have been found on the southern flank.<ref name="AndresPalacios2011" />

Unlike on El Misti, [[permafrost]] has been found on Chachani.<ref name="UbedaYoshikawa2015" /> Continuous permafrost covers a surface area of {{convert|16.8|km2}} on Chachani, with a total area of {{convert|47.1|km2}}. The coverage starts at {{convert|5050|m}} altitude on the southern flank and coverage becomes continuous above {{convert|5420|m}}.<ref name="AndresPalacios2011" />

==Climbing routes==
[[File:Chachani November 2010.JPG|thumb|left|160px| View towards the summit (2010)]]
The mountain is normally climbed from its northern side. The start of the trek is at a drop-off point which is reached in 2.5 hours by four-wheel drive vehicle, driving west around Chachani and turning off from the main highway near Pampa Cañahuas, or heading north from Arequipa between Misti and Chachani. Base camp is at approximately {{convert|5,200|m}}. There is another higher camp called Camp Azulfrera situated at about {{convert|5,400|m}}. The route starts with the ascent to the Angel Col before traversing the El Angel mountain itself. Then climbers ascend the face of Fatima mountain in a zig-zag pattern before making another traverse on the Fatima mountain. Only then the summit of Chachani can be seen. From there, climbers need to make the final ascent on the face of Chachani all the way to the top of the mountain.

The standard route requires [[crampons]] and an [[ice axe]], but does not require roping up, as there are no large [[crevasses]] on Chachani. Two traverses over relatively steep terrain constitute the main challenges on the way to the summit. The final push to the summit is a very steep{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=August 2014}} scree slope, which provides for a fast descent back to the first traverse.

In recent years,{{When|date=August 2014}} the amount of snow on Chachani has decreased dramatically, so for many months of the year there may be little snow on the mountain. For example, in October and November 2010, there was no snow at all, and the ascent could be made without crampons or ice axes. Climbers need to check on the snow conditions beforehand.

The average total climb time from base camp ranges from six to nine hours, with a two-to four-hour descent.

== Human and religious activity ==

A Inca temple was constructed on Chachani's summit area, and archeological relics date back to pre-Hispanic times. This sanctuary was looted as early as the end of the 19th century. During one of these lootings, a skeleton of a woman, wooden vessels and ceramics. An archeological study in 2013 did suggest that Chachani's summit was the site of [[Capacocha]] sacrifices. Rock material from Chachani has been used to construct churches in [[Arequipa]] and sulfur was mined on the mountain. Oral tradition attributes to Chachani the ability to choose the gender of newborn children.<ref name="Ceruti2013" />
