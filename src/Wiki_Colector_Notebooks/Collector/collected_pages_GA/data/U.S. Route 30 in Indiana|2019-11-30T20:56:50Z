'''U.S. Route 30''' ('''US&nbsp;30''') is a road in the [[United States Numbered Highway System]] that runs from [[Astoria, Oregon]] to [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. In Indiana, the route runs from the Illinois state line at [[Dyer, Indiana|Dyer]] to the Ohio state line east of [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] and [[New Haven, Indiana|New Haven]].  The {{convert| 155.96 |mi|km|2}} of US&nbsp;30 that lie within Indiana serve as a major conduit.  The entire length of U.S. Route 30 in Indiana is included in the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] (NHS). The highway includes four-lane, rural sections, an urbanized, four-lane divided expressway, and several high-traffic, six-lane freeway areas.  First designated as a US Highway in 1926, US&nbsp;30 replaced the original State Road 2 (SR&nbsp;2) and SR&nbsp;44 designation of the highway which dated back to the formation of the Indiana State Road system.  A section of the highway originally served as part of the [[Lincoln Highway]].  Realignment and construction projects have expanded the highway to four lanes across the state, and the road is now part of a long stretch of US&nbsp;30 from [[New Lenox, Illinois]] to [[Canton, Ohio]] where the road has at least four lanes (excluding ramps).  There are over 40 traffic signals between I-65 at Merrillville and I-69 at Fort Wayne.

The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state highways as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called [[average annual daily traffic]] (AADT), calculated along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2010, INDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were 10,870&nbsp;vehicles and 4,750 commercial vehicles used the highway daily between US&nbsp;31 and SR&nbsp;331. The peak traffic volumes were 69,280&nbsp;vehicles and 12,660 commercial vehicles AADT along a section of US&nbsp;30 that is concurrent with I-69, between the Lima Road (interchange 311) and Coldwater Road (interchange 312) exits in Fort Wayne.<ref name="AADT">{{cite web|url=http://dotmaps.indot.in.gov/apps/trafficcounts/|title=INDOT Traffic Zones|publisher=Indiana Department of Transportation|year=2010|accessdate=August 20, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505203005/http://dotmaps.indot.in.gov/apps/trafficcounts/|archivedate=May 5, 2011}}</ref>

=== Illinois to Valparaiso ===
US&nbsp;30 enters [[Dyer, Indiana|Dyer]] from [[Lynwood, Illinois]] along the original alignment of the [[Lincoln Highway in Indiana|Lincoln Highway]], as a four-lane divided highway.  At Moeller Street, the roadway becomes a four-lane highway with a center turn lane before reaching an [[at-grade intersection]] with [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] railroad tracks.  Thereafter, the road returns to four-lane divided highway before a [[traffic light]] at [[U.S. Route 41 in Indiana|US&nbsp;41]] in [[Schererville, Indiana|Schererville]] and passing under [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]] railroad tracks.  After US&nbsp;41, the original alignment of the Lincoln Highway leaves US&nbsp;30 and continues along the same route as old [[Indiana State Road 330|State Road 330]] (SR&nbsp;330).  US&nbsp;30 begins to curve towards the southeast, still as a four-lane divided highway.  The highway has a traffic light at [[Indiana State Road 55|SR&nbsp;55]], heading east as the roadway enters [[Merrillville, Indiana|Merrillville]], where the route becomes a six-lane divided highway and has an interchange at [[Interstate 65 in Indiana|Interstate 65]] (I-65).  At Colorado Street in Merrillville, the road narrows back to a four-lane divided highway.<ref name="Google Maps" /><ref name="INDOT 2012 Map" /><ref name="INDOT Railroad map" />

[[File:US Route 30 in Indiana.jpg|thumb|left|310px|US Route 30 in Indiana.]]
After a traffic light at the southern terminus of [[Indiana State Road 51|SR&nbsp;51]] in [[Hobart, Indiana|Hobart]], the original alignment of the Lincoln Highway rejoins US&nbsp;30.  The highway passes through a mix of farmland and residential properties on the way to [[Valparaiso, Indiana|Valparaiso]], entering the city and passing through commercial properties.  The highway has a traffic light at [[Indiana State Road 2|SR&nbsp;2]] at the western end of the concurrency of the two roads.  From there, the road crosses railroad tracks, passes south of [[Valparaiso University]], and has a traffic light at the eastern terminus of [[Indiana State Road 130|SR&nbsp;130]].  After passing the traffic light at SR&nbsp;130, the road has a full interchange with [[Indiana State Road 49|SR&nbsp;49]] and the eastern terminus of the [[Indiana State Road 2|SR&nbsp;2]] and US 30 concurrency.  Continuing east, the road passes the [[Porter County Municipal Airport]] and proceeds east-southeast from Valparaiso, towards [[Plymouth, Indiana|Plymouth]].

=== Valparaiso to Allen County ===
After leaving the Valparaiso area, US 30 passes through rural farmland, with an intersection at [[U.S. Route 421 in Indiana|US&nbsp;421]] northeast of [[Wanatah, Indiana|Wanatah]] and an at-grade railroad crossing with the [[Chesapeake and Indiana Railroad]].  East of the railroad tracks is an intersection with [[Indiana State Road 39|SR&nbsp;39]] and a bridge across the [[Kankakee River]].<ref name="Google Maps" /><ref name="INDOT 2012 Map" /><ref name="INDOT Railroad map" />  Then the route briefly swings slightly to the north of the old Lincoln Highway alignment to accommodate an interchange at [[U.S. Route 35 in Indiana|US&nbsp;35]].

US 30 runs along the north side of Plymouth, passing through an interchange with the northern terminus of [[Indiana State Road 17|SR&nbsp;17]] and near the [[Plymouth Municipal Airport (Indiana)|Plymouth Municipal Airport]].  The route curves around the northeast side of the city, having a major interchange with [[U.S. Route 31 in Indiana|US&nbsp;31]] before heading east-southeast towards [[Warsaw, Indiana|Warsaw]].  At [[Bourbon, Indiana|Bourbon]], the highway has an interchange with [[Indiana State Road 331|SR&nbsp;331]].  The road curves east before entering Warsaw and has an interchange with [[Indiana State Road 15|SR&nbsp;15]], south of the [[Warsaw Municipal Airport (Indiana)|Warsaw Municipal Airport]].  After passing the airport, the road enters a mix of commercial and residential properties.  As it bypasses Warsaw the highway passes through a highly commercial area and has 9 traffic signals within four miles, causing frequent traffic backups. One of these is a traffic light at an old alignment of the Lincoln Highway, before US 30 passes north of [[Winona Lake, Indiana|Winona Lake]] and heads towards [[Columbia City, Indiana|Columbia City]].

At Columbia City, the road turns southeast and has traffic lights at [[Indiana State Road 109|SR&nbsp;109]], [[Indiana State Road 9|SR&nbsp;9]], and [[Indiana State Road 205|SR&nbsp;205]], again closely spaced, resulting in frequent congestion.  After SR&nbsp;205, US&nbsp;30 heads east towards [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], paralleling the Chicago, Fort Wayne and Eastern Railroad.<ref name="Google Maps" /><ref name="INDOT 2012 Map" /><ref name="INDOT Railroad map" />

=== Allen County to Ohio ===
==== Western Allen County ====
[[File:US 30 west of Fort Wayne, Indiana.jpg|thumb|right|325px|U.S. Route 30 west of Fort Wayne, Indiana.]]
US&nbsp;30 crosses into [[Allen County, Indiana|Allen County]] at a signalized intersection with Whitley County Road 800 East (signed as County Line Road). After passing a pair of abandoned rest areas, the four-lane divided highway with partial access control then becomes a full access controlled freeway just east of the signalized intersection at Kroemer Road. Immediately thereafter, there is a [[interchange (road)#Trumpet interchange|trumpet interchange]] with [[U.S. Route 33 in Indiana|US&nbsp;33 (Goshen Road)]], at the western terminus of US&nbsp;33's concurrency with US&nbsp;30. From there, the joined routes proceed southeast as a six-lane (counting auxiliary lanes) freeway, passing under Hillegas Road, to a [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[Interstate 69 in Indiana|I-69]].  At that junction, US&nbsp;33 joins southbound I-69 (and westbound  [[U.S. Route 24 in Indiana|US&nbsp;24]]), while US&nbsp;30 loops to the north, to run concurrent with both northbound I-69 and eastbound US&nbsp;24. The through lanes revert to an urban [[arterial]] and continue southeast into Fort Wayne as Goshen Road, carrying [[Indiana State Road 930|SR&nbsp;930]] only as far as Coliseum Boulevard (where it departs to the east, leaving Goshen Road to revert to an undivided city street).

==== Fort Wayne to New Haven ====
US 30's concurrency with I-69 is a six-lane urban interstate with interchanges at Lima Road ([[U.S. Route 27 in Indiana|US&nbsp;27]] and [[Indiana State Road 3|SR&nbsp;3]]) and Coldwater Road (formerly [[Indiana State Road 327|SR&nbsp;327]] and prior to that, US&nbsp;27).   At the interchange of I-69 and [[Interstate 469|I-469]], US 30 heads east concurrent with I-469 to loop around the north and east sides of Fort Wayne, heading toward [[New Haven, Indiana|New Haven]].  I-469 is a four-lane interstate passing through a mix of farmland and suburban residential properties.  Initially proceeding east, the interstate crosses the [[St. Joseph River (Maumee River)|St. Joseph River]] and has an interchange at Maplecrest Road before turning southeast, then south around the northeast side of Fort Wayne to subsequent interchanges with [[Indiana State Road 37|SR&nbsp;37]] followed by US&nbsp;24.  After the US&nbsp;24 interchange, the interstate crosses the [[Maumee River]] and Norfolk Southern railroad tracks before US&nbsp;30 departs I-469 east of downtown New Haven at the eastern terminus of [[Indiana State Road 930|SR&nbsp;930]].

==== Eastern Allen County ====
After I-469, US&nbsp;30 heads southeast away from New Haven, passing through rural farmland as a four-lane divided highway with partial access control.  The route bypasses the tiny hamlets of [[Zulu, Indiana|Zulu]], [[Tillman, Indiana|Tillman]], and [[Townley, Indiana|Townley]] with an intersection at [[Indiana State Road 101|SR&nbsp;101]] just to the north of the latter. US&nbsp;30 completes its journey across the Hoosier State and enters Ohio (at State Line Road), continuing southeast toward [[Van Wert, Ohio|Van Wert]].<ref name="Google Maps">{{google maps |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Joliet+St&daddr=U.S.+30+E&hl=en&ll=40.95916,-86.154785&spn=2.439162,4.581299&sll=40.997994,-84.803494&sspn=0.00119,0.002237&geocode=FTAoeQId8XjI-g%3BFcCUcQIdVADy-g&mra=me&mrsp=1,0&sz=19&t=h&z=8|title=Overview of US&nbsp;30 in Indiana |accessdate=August 20, 2012}}</ref><ref name="INDOT 2012 Map">{{cite map|url=http://www.in.gov/indot/files/StateTransportationMap.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Indiana Department of Transportation|title=Indiana Transportation Map|year=2011–2012|section=A3-A5|accessdate=August 20, 2012|cartography=INDOT}}</ref><ref name="INDOT Railroad map">{{cite map |publisher= Indiana Department of Transportation |date= August 23, 2011 |url= http://www.in.gov/indot/files/MAIN-RR-11_V1.pdf |title= Indiana Railroad Map |format= PDF |cartography= INDOT |accessdate=August 20, 2012}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Lincoln Highway porcelain sign.svg|thumb|right|100px|Lincoln Highway shield.]]
The Lincoln Highway was planned in 1913 to run west to east across Indiana, including to [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] and Fort Wayne.  In 1915, the highway opened and passed through downtown Fort Wayne on its route through Indiana,<ref name="News-Sentinel May 2009">{{cite news|title=Lincoln Highway: Road's hidden past could be route to future  |first1=Kevin |last1=Leininger |newspaper=[[The News-Sentinel]] |location=Fort Wayne |oclc=8807796 <!--|accessdate=August 22, 2012--> |date=May 5, 2009|page=1A}}</ref> and was assigned the designation of Main Market route number 2 in 1917.<ref name="1917 Indiana State Highway Map and State Highway Commission">{{cite map|url=http://www.libraries.iub.edu/index.php?pageId=1002216|publisher= Indiana State Highway Commission |title= Report of State Highway Commission |map=1917 Indiana State Highway Map and State Highway Commission|accessdate=September 1, 2012 |cartography= ISHC}}</ref><ref name="INDOT 1917">{{cite map|url=http://bl-libg-doghill.ads.iu.edu/gm-web/imdb/inhwy1917.jpg |publisher=Indiana State Highway Commission |title=Indiana Main Market Highway Map |date=June 1, 1917 |access-date= September 1, 2012 |cartography= ISHC}}</ref>  Further designations saw the route become SR&nbsp;2 from the Illinois state line to Valparaiso, SR&nbsp;44 Valparaiso to Fort Wayne and SR&nbsp;2 from Fort Wayne to the Ohio state line.

During the 1950s, US 30 in Fort Wayne was rerouted to a "circumurban" highway that was built along portions of the alignments of Beuter Road and California Road, to bypass most of Fort Wayne. But this "circumurban" route, later renamed Coliseum Boulevard since it passes directly by the [[Allen County War Memorial Coliseum]], quickly became a congested urban highway in its own right as it was not built to freeway standards.  In 1998, US&nbsp;30 in Fort Wayne was again rerouted onto I-69 and I-469, becoming a true controlled access freeway bypass for most of Fort Wayne and New Haven on the north and east side of the two cities.  The old Coliseum Boulevard routing was assigned the SR&nbsp;930 designation as a result, when local officials refused to let INDOT fully decommission the route and turn responsibility for it over to the cities or the county.<ref name="busy Coliseum Boulevard">{{cite news|url=http://www.news-sentinel.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090924/NEWS/909240315/0/FRONTPAGE|date=September 8, 2009|last=Leininger |first=Kevin| accessdate=August 30, 2012 |title=We need solution for Indiana 930 |oclc=8807796}}</ref>
