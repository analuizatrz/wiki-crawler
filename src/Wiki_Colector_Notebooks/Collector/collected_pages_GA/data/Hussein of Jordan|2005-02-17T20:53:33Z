'''Hussein bin Talal''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: &#1581;&#1587;&#1610;&#1606;&#32;&#1576;&#1606;&#32;&#1591;&#1604;&#1575;&#1604;)  ([[November 14]], [[1935]] - [[February 7]], [[1999]]) was the [[King of Jordan|King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]] from [[1952]] to [[1999]].

On [[July 20]], [[1951]], [[Abdullah I of Jordan|King Abdullah I]] traveled to [[Jerusalem]] to perform his [[Friday prayers]] with his young grandson, Prince Hussein. He was assassinated by a gunman at the instigation of Colonel Abdullah Tell, ex-Military Governor of Jerusalem, and Dr Musa Abdullah Husseini, on the steps of one of the holiest shrines of Islam, the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]]. Hussein grappled with the assailant, until he was wounded himself; he is said to have been saved from a bullet by a medal his grandfather had recently awarded him and insisted he wear.

Abdullah's eldest son, [[King Talal]] was crowned as [[King of Jordan|King]], but within a year was forced to resign because of mental illness. His son Prince Hussein was proclaimed King of the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]] on [[August 11]], [[1952]] at age 16 and was enthroned on [[May 2]], [[1953]].

His reign was controversial, while it saw Jordan remain one of the most free states in the Middle East, it was also marked by the events of [[Black September in Jordan|Black September]] when the king ordered the violent expulsion of the [[PLO]] from Jordan.  The country also defied the west and the other allied leaders by siding with [[Saddam Hussein]] in the [[Gulf War]].  In [[1994]] King Hussein led negotiations to end the official state of war with the [[State of Israel]] resulting in the [[Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace]]. The king wrote three books: ''Uneasy Lies the Head'' ([[1962]]), about his childhood and early years as king, ''My War With Israel'' ([[1969]]), and ''Mon Métier de Roi''.

He died of [[cancer]] on [[February 7]], [[1999]]. The King had been suffering from the disease for many years and had visited the [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota]], [[United States]] on a fairly regular basis for treatment.  Just before his death, he changed his will and disinherited his brother, [[Hassan of Jordan|Hassan]], who had been corwn prince for several decades, and designated his eldest son, [[Abdullah II of Jordan|Abdullah]] as heir. The King was at the time of his death one of the longest serving leaders in international politics.

He was married four times. His four wives were:

* Sharifa Dina bint 'Abdu'l-Hamid, an [[Egypt]]ian-born third cousin of King Hussein's father, [[King Talal]], on [[April 19]], [[1955]]. A graduate of [[Cambridge University]] and a former lecturer in English literature at [[Cairo University]], the bride was 26 to the groom's 19. They separated in [[1956]] and were divorced in [[1957]], at which time Queen Dina became known as Princess Dina. She became an Egyptian citizen in [[1963]], and in October [[1970]], Princess Dina of Jordan married Asad Sulayman Abd al-Qadir, alias Salah Taamari, a Palestinian [[guerilla]] commando who became a high-ranking official in the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]].
**Daughter: Alia (born 1956).
* Antoinette (Toni) Avril Gardiner (born [[Chelmondiston]], England, [[1941]], renamed Muna al-Hussein on conversion to Islam), on [[May 25]], [[1961]].

Walter Percy Gardiner, she was given the title Princess Muna al Hussein on [[January 30]], [[1962]], divorced 1972.
