{{for|other people with this name|Rodrigo Lopez (disambiguation)}}
'''Rodrigo Lopez''', whose original name was probably '''Rodrigo Lopes''' (c. 1525 – [[June 7]] [[1594]]), was physician to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]], and may have been an inspiration for Shakespeare's [[Shylock]] in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.

He was born in [[Crato, Portugal]] and raised as a [[New Christian]].  He was driven away from [[Portugal]] by the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] and was considered a [[Marrano]] (a hidden [[Jew]]).

He made London his home in 1559 and successfully resumed his practice as a doctor, soon becoming house physician at [[St. Bartholomew's Hospital]].  Despite racial prejudice and professional jealousy, he developed a large practice among powerful people, including [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]] and [[Francis Walsingham]]. Rumor held that his success was less due to his medical skill and more to his skill at flattery and self-promotion. A 1584 libelous pamphlet attacking Dudley suggested that Lopez distilled poisons for Dudley and other noblemen as well. In 1586, Lopez reached the pinnacle of his profession; he was made [[physician-in-chief]] to Queen Elizabeth.  Lopez earned the queen's favour for in 1589 she granted him a monopoly on the importation of aniseed and sumac.  His success continued as he neared retirement. He was viewed, at least outwardly, as being a dutiful practicing [[Protestant]].

In October of 1593, Lopez was wealthy and generally respected. At that time, he owned a house in [[Holborn]] and had a son enrolled at [[Winchester College]]. However, also in October, a complex web of conspiracy against [[António, Prior of Crato|Dom António]] began to come to light. Subsequently, [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Robert Devereux]] accused Lopez of conspiring with Spanish emissaries to poison the Queen. He was arrested on January 1, 1594, convicted in February, and subsequently executed ([[Hanging, drawing and quartering|hanged, drawn and quartered]]) on June 7. 

The Queen herself was uncertain of his guilt and delayed his execution.  Lopez maintained his innocence and his true conversion from Judaism to Christianity.  According to the 16th century historian [[William Camden]], just before Lopez was hanged, he said to the crowd that he loved his queen as well as he loved Jesus Christ.  The crowd laughed at this statement, taking it for a thinly veiled confession.  

Some historians and literary critics consider Lopez and his trial to have been an influence on [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.<ref>Faye Kellerman, ''The Quality of Mercy'' (historical novel), "Historical Summary", pp. 606-607, New York, Morrow, 1989.</ref> "Many Shakespearean scholars believe Dr. Lopez was the prototype for Shylock...."<ref>Greenblatt, S. (2004). ''Will In The World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare,'' New York: W. W. Norton.</ref>, which is believed to have been written between 1594 and 1597, though the play undoubtedly relies more on [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[The Jew of Malta]]''. Marlowe also loosely mentioned Lopez in the first, unrevised script for ''[[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus]]'', comparing him to the titular hero: "Doctor Lopus was never such a doctor!".
