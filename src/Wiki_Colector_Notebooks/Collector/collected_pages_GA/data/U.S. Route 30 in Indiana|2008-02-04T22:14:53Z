In the state of [[Indiana]], '''[[U.S. Route 30]]''' is an east-west four-lane divided highway across northern [[Indiana]]. It runs from the [[Illinois]] state line at [[Dyer, Indiana|Dyer]] to east of [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] at the [[Ohio]] state line. This is a distance of 151.8 miles (244.3 km).

== Route description ==
===Dyer to Valparaiso ===
{{seealso|Lincoln Highway}}
U.S. 30 enters Dyer from [[Lynwood, Illinois]] along the original alignment of the Lincoln Highway. It has four lanes from the state line through the densely populated cities of Dyer, [[Schererville, Indiana|Schererville]] and [[Merrillville, Indiana|Merrillville]]. East of [[U.S. Route 41]], U.S. 30 becomes a [[divided highway]], and remains largely divided through the rest of the state.

East of Merrillville, U.S. 30 runs through rural areas until reaching the outskirts of [[Valparaiso, Indiana|Valparaiso]]. It runs through the southern portion of Valparaiso as Morthland Avenue before leaving the city at a full interchange with [[Indiana State Road 2]].

U.S. 30 continues eastward<ref>Indiana 2000; Indiana Department of Transporatation</ref>, along the original Lincoln Highway right of way, diverging around each town.  At Wanatah, it meets with [[U.S. Route 421]], running from Michigan City, Indiana on Lake Michigan southward towards Indianapolis and later the Ohio River.

Beyond [[Wanatah, Indiana|Wanatah]] the countryside is primarily rural.  U.S. passes by Hanna and then runs over the [[Kankakee River]].  Following towns of [[Hamlet, Indiana|Hamlet]], Grovertown, and Donaldson are all traffic lights with a gas station or a convenience store.<ref>Annual personal travel along this route since 1991</ref>  [[Plymouth, Indiana|Plymouth]] ({{Convert|63|mi|km|0}} from Illinois border) is the next major city.  The road passes to the north of town.  Here, there are two intersections of store and restaurants.

Beyond [[Plymouth, Indiana|Plymouth]] is again rural divided highway, passing Inwood, Bourbon, Etna Green, and Atwood<ref>Indiana 2000; Indiana Department of Transporatation</ref>.  Twenty-six miles beyond Plymouth, is [[Warsaw, Indiana|Warsaw]] and a five miles of shopping.  This is the most congested section of U.S. 30 in the state.  (Around [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] there will be more traffic, but the route is interstate and designed to carry the larger volume.)

From Warsaw it's {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} to [[Columbia City, Indiana|Columbia City]] and another grouping of shops and stores.  Columbia City is a convenient stop as it's {{convert|21|mi|km|0}} from Fort Wayne and it's easier to get on and off U.S. 30 than in Fort Wayne.<ref>Annual personal travel along this route since 1991</ref>

Approaching Fort Wayne, U.S. 30 is joined by [[U.S. Route 33]] from the north and soon after, [[Interstate 69]] (abbreviated I-69).  Here, U.S. 30 will join with I-69 North. The junction of U.S. 33 is immediately before the I-69 South turn and then you sweep across the interstate and it's an immediate right, looping down onto the freeway.{{what}}  It's about {{convert|6|mi|km|0}} north to U.S. 30's interchange to I-469 East.  In this short distance, there is heavy traffic and two interchanges with the northeast side of Fort Wayne.  The exit for U.S. 30 is located on the right side, traveling northbound.

At I-469, the area again is becoming rural.  I-469 East runs around the north and east side of [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]].  There is little development along this route (2007).  It is {{convert|12|mi|km|0}} to where U.S. 30 leaves I-469, east bound for the [[Ohio]] border.  A few services have developed just beyond the I-469 interchange.  The last {{convert|14|mi|km|0}} are all rural, with no identifiable towns along the route.<ref>Annual personal travel along this route since 1991</ref>
