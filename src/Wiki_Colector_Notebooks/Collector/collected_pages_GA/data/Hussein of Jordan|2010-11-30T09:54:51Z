'''Hussein bin Talal''' ({{lang-ar|حسين بن طلال}}, ''{{unicode|Ḥusayn bin Ṭalāl}}''; 14 November 1935 – 7 February 1999) was the [[List of Kings of Jordan|King]] of [[Jordan]] from the abdication of his father, [[Talal of Jordan|King Talal]], in 1952, until his death. Hussein lead Jordan through the [[Cold War]] and four decades of [[Arab-Israeli conflict]].<ref name="CNN1">{{cite news|title=King Hussein is dead|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9902/07/king.hussein.obit/|publisher=CNN|date=1999-02-07}}</ref> He recognized Israel in 1994, becoming the second Arab head of state to do so.

Hussein's family claims a line of descent from the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]. "We are the family of the prophet and we are the oldest tribe in the Arab world," the king once said of his [[Hashemite]] ancestry.<ref name="CNN1" />

==Early life and accession==
Hussein was born in [[Amman]] on 14 November 1935, to then Prince Talal bin Abdullah and [[Zein al Sharaf Talal|Princess Zein al-Sharaf bint Jamil]]. After completing his elementary education in Amman, he was educated at [[Victoria College, Alexandria|Victoria College]] in [[Alexandria]]. He proceeded to [[Harrow School]] in [[England]], where he befriended his cousin [[Faisal II of Iraq]]. He pursued further study at the Royal Military Academy [[Sandhurst]].

[[Image:Young.king.jpg|left|200px|thumb|In 1952, Hussein bin Talal was named King of Jordan, several weeks before his 17th birthday]]

On  20 July 1951, Prince Hussein traveled to [[Jerusalem]] to perform [[Friday prayers]] at the  [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] with his grandfather, [[Abdullah I of Jordan|King Abdullah I]]. A Palestinian extremist, fearing the king might negotiate a peace with the newly created state of Israel, opened fire on Abdullah and his grandson. Abdullah was killed, but the 15-year-old Hussein survived the assassination attempt, and according to the Jordanian government, pursued the gunman. The Jordanian government claims that the gunman turned his weapon on the young prince, who was saved when the bullet was deflected by a medal on his uniform which had been given to him by his grandfather.<ref name="CNN1" />

In his autobiography, ''Uneasy Lies the Head'', Hussein recalls how three days before that fateful day in Jerusalem, his grandfather turned to him and said: "''I hope you realize, my son, that one day you will have to assume responsibility. I look to you to do your very best to see that my work is not lost. I look to you to continue it in the service of our people.''”<ref>Hussein of Jordan, HM King. Uneasy Lies the Head. London: Heinemann, 1963</ref>

He was appointed Crown Prince of Jordan on 9 September 1951. Abdullah's eldest son, [[King Talal]], became [[King of Jordan]], but within a year was forced to abdicate owing to his mental state (European and Arab doctors diagnosed schizophrenia).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalty.nu/MiddleEast/Jordan/Hussein.html |title=Royalty in Jordan - The Life of King Hussein |publisher=Royalty.nu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-01}}</ref> King Talal's son, Crown Prince Hussein, was proclaimed King of the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]] on 11 August 1952, succeeding at the age of 16; because this was under the legal age, he was enthroned a year later, on  2 May 1953.<ref name="CNN1" />

Hussein was an avid [[amateur radio]] operator and an Honorary Member of the [[Radio Society of Harrow]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.g3efx.org.uk/ |title=The Radio Society of Harrow |publisher=G3efx.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-07-01}}</ref> (callsign JY1) and throughout his reign could often be found talking directly to other people around the world. An accomplished aircraft pilot, he also loved to fly [[airplane]]s (propeller and jet), as well as [[helicopter]]s.

King Hussein was succeeded as king by his eldest son [[Abdullah II of Jordan]].

==Reign==
[[File:King Hussein in 1955 visit to UK - Royal Hasemite Image.gif|thumb|King Hussein on a British Air Force base in 1955.]]
In March 1956 Hussein established his authority over Jordan, and burnished his own nationalist credentials by dismissing [[John Bagot Glubb|Glubb “Pasha”]] as the commander of the Jordanian Army, and replacing all the British officers with Jordanians. This now mainly [[Bedouin]] army was fiercely loyal to him, due to tribal connections.

Hussein's rule was marred with secret collaboration with Israel and the United States, which often adversely affected the surrounding Arab States and peoples, including the Palestinians. Secret meetings between King Hussein and Israeli foreign ministers [[Abba Eban]] and [[Golda Meir]] began on or before 1963. The purpose of the meetings were to plan and support Israeli initiatives in combating [[Fatah]] guerrillas. Hussein accepted minor raids into Jordanian territory by the [[Israeli Defence Forces]].  He would later state "I told them I could not absorb a serious retaliatory raid, and they accepted the logic of this and promised there would never be one". <ref>Bowen 2003, p.&nbsp;26 (citing Amman Cables 1456, 1457, 11 December 1966, National Security Files (Country File: Middle East), LBJ Library (Austin, Texas), Box 146).</ref>

On Nov 13, 1966, Israeli military conducted a major incursion into Jordanian territory, violating their secret agreement with King Hussein, in what became known as the [[Samu Incident]]. Two days later, in response to the incident, in a memo to [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], his Special Assistant [[Walt Whitman Rostow|Walt Rostow]] wrote: "retaliation is not the point in this case. This 3000-man raid with tanks and planes was out of all proportion to the provocation and was aimed at the wrong target," and went on to describe the damage done to US and Israeli interests:
<blockquote>They've wrecked a good system of tacit cooperation between Hussein and the Israelis... They've undercut Hussein. We've spent $500 million to shore him up as a stabilizing factor on Israel's longest border and vis-à-vis Syria and Iraq. Israel's attack increases the pressure on him to counterattack not only from the more radical Arab governments and from the Palestinians in Jordan but also from the Army, which is his main source of support and may now press for a chance to recoup its Sunday losses... They've set back progress toward a long term accommodation with the Arabs... They may have persuaded the Syrians that Israel didn't dare attack Soviet-protected Syria but could attack US-backed Jordan with impunity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/www/about_state/history/vol_xviii/zh.html |title=Memorandum From the President's Special Assistant (Rostow) to President Johnson |location=Washington |date=15 November 1966 |accessdate=22 October 2005}}</ref></blockquote>

Perception of King Hussein's secret collaboration with Israel lead to great dissatisfaction of his rule both at home and throughout the Arab World.  President [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]] of [[Egypt]] often referred to Hussein as "an "imperialist lackey".<ref name="bbc onthisday">BBC On this Day, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/30/newsid_2493000/2493177.stm Egypt and Jordan unite against Israel]. Retrieved 8 October 2005.</ref>  Army Commander-in-Chief General [[Sharif Zaid Ben Shaker]] warned in a press conference that "If Jordan does not join the war a civil war will erupt in Jordan".<ref>quoted in Mutawi 2002, p.&nbsp;102.</ref>  In order to maintain credibility in the Arab world and maintain stability at home, on May 30 1967, King Hussein signed a mutual defense treaty with Egypt, and handed over command of the Jordanian military to Egyptian generals.

==Six-Day War==
{{Main|Six-Day War}}
In June 1967, Jordan along with Syria and Egypt were attacked by Israel, in what the Israeli government claimed was a [[pre-emptive strike]]. Jordan lost control of the [[West Bank]] and [[east Jerusalem]] and saw its military shattered.  In addition the country was, for a second time, over-run with many Palestinian refugees, fleeing the Israeli assault. Like on previous occasions, Israel did not allow the fleeing refugees to return to the territories it captured during the war.  As a result, Palestinian refugees who fled the 1948 and 1967 wars, outnumbered Jordan's natural citizens. Most refugees were provided citizenship by the Hussein regime. Due to their sheer numbers, Palestinian factions in Jordan were able to exercise considerable authority essentially governing some areas of Jordan, leading to many considering them a state within a state. <ref name="CNN2">{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9902/07/king.hussein.obit/chrono/chrono.html |title=CNN - Highlights of King Hussein's life |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-01}}</ref>

==Black September==
{{Main|Black September in Jordan|l1=Black September}}
In September, 1970, in accordance with secret agreements with Israel and the US, Hussein ordered the forcible expulsion of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] by the Jordanian military. The attacks on Palestinian fighters and civilians further deteriorated King Hussein's image in the Arab and Muslim world. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}


==1973 Arab-Israeli War==
{{Main|Yom Kippur War}}
After the death of Egyptian president [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]], his successor, Anwar Sadat, made several offers of peace and recognition, in return for the Egyptian lands captured by Israel during the [[six day war]]. The Israeli government rejected all offers, in line with US secretary of state  [[Henry Kissinger]]'s stalemate policy. .<ref name="response">"[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1947-1974/28%20The%20Jarring%20initiative%20and%20the%20response-%208%20Febr The Jarring initiative and the response]," ''Israel's Foreign Relations'', Selected Documents, vols. 1–2, 1947–1974 . Retrieved June 9, 2005.</ref> Sadat warned that Egypt would attempt to recapture the territories through war, but the Israeli government, perhaps due to the perception of the Israeli military invincibility after the [[six day war]], mistook Sadat's threat as empty posturing.

Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]] and Syrian president [[Hafez al-Assad]] met King Hussein in 1973 to discuss the possibility of war. Hussein, fearing another loss of territory to Israel declined.  Furthermore, Hussein was suspicious of Sadat's promise to [[PLO]] Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] to hand over the West Bank to the Palestinians, in the event of a victory, as he considered the [[West Bank]] to be Jordanian territory.  On the night of September 25, Hussein secretly flew to [[Tel Aviv]]  to warn Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir of an impending Syrian attack. "Are (the Syrians) going to war without the Egyptians, asked Mrs. Meir. The king said he didn't think so. 'I think they [Egypt] would cooperate'". <ref>Rabinovich, The Yom Kippur War, Schocken Books, 2004. Page 50</ref>

On Oct 6, 1973, Syria and Egypt attacked Israel without the aide of Jordan. Although Israel militarily defeated the two armies, the war lead to Israel taking Sadat seriously and engage in negotiations which resulted in the return of captured Egyptian territories and the recognition of Israel by Egypt.

==The Gulf War==
{{Hashemite-Jordan}}
{{Main|Gulf War}}
Jordan remained neutral during the [[Gulf War]] primarily due to the country's severe economic reliance of Iraqi oil.

==Peace with Israel==
{{Main|Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace}}

In 1994, Hussein concluded negotiations to end the official state of war with [[Israel]] resulting in the [[Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace]] which he had begun negotiating in secret with the Israelis in the 1960s. Between 1963—1994 he had held at least 55 secret meetings with leading Israelis including at least seven prime and foreign ministers.<ref>(''The Economist'', 11/24/07, p.88)</ref> At the signing of the treaty at [[Wadi Araba]] on 26 October, Hussein described the event as the beginning of:

::“Mutual [[respect]] between us all, [[tolerance]], and the coming together of people, of generations to come beyond this time, to build and achieve what is worthy of them..."<ref>{{cite web|author=Business Optimization Consultants B.O.C. |url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/speeches_letters.html |title=The Library - Speeches and Letters |publisher=Kinghussein.gov.jo |date= |accessdate=2010-07-01}}</ref>

During the negotiations of the treaty Hussein developed strong ties of friendship with Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]].  On  6 November 1995 Hussein gave a powerful speech at the funeral of his friend:

:''Full text: [[wikisource:Hussein of Jordan's Speech at Rabin's Funeral]]''

::“My sister, Mrs. Leah Rabin, my friends, I had never thought that the moment would come like this when I would grieve the loss of a brother, a colleague and a friend — a man, a soldier who met us on the opposite side of a divide whom we respected as he respected us. A man I came to know because I realized, as he did, that we have to cross over the divide, establish a dialogue, get to know each other and strive to leave for those who follow us a legacy that is worthy of them. And so we did. And so we became brethren and friends... And as I stand here, I am obliged to you, to my people in Jordan and to the world, to keep on doing the utmost to guarantee that we leave behind a similar inheritance.“<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danielpipes.org/article/4255 |title=Transcript from CNN life coverage by Daniel Pipes |publisher=Danielpipes.org |date=1995-11-06 |accessdate=2010-07-01}}</ref>

==Summit of the Peacemakers==
On  13 March 1996 the “Summit of the Peacemakers” was held at [[Sharm el-Sheikh]], [[Egypt]] hosted by Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]]. Besides Hussein, those who attended included such dignitaries as Turkish President [[Suleiman Demirel]], Israeli Prime Minister [[Shimon Peres]], US President [[Bill Clinton]],  and Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]]. The summit was convened in order to put the Israeli-Palestinian peace process back on track after a spate of suicide bombings in Israel. In his address to the gathering, Hussein stressed that those who use religious justifications for terrorist acts have tarnished the image of [[Islam]], which is a religion of peace, tolerance and dialogue. Hussein also said that a dual approach must be used in the fight against [[terrorism]]. Sources of funding, training and operations must be cut off, and media coverage must not encourage terrorism. He added that States in the Middle East and throughout the world must eliminate those sources of despair that drive persons to perform such horrible actions, stating:

::“We must shoulder our responsibilities and work together to protect the [[dignity]] of human beings, whoever and wherever they may be.”

==Hebron Agreement==
{{Main|Hebron Agreement}}
While refusing to negotiate on behalf of either the [[Palestinians]] or the [[Israelis]], Hussein would offer ideas to bridge the gaps between the two parties. For instance, his 11th-hour intervention in January 1997 brought Palestinian Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] and Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] to an agreement on the long-awaited withdrawal of Israeli troops from most of the [[West Bank]] town of [[Hebron]].

==The Wye accords==
{{Main|Wye River Memorandum}}
In 1997 when U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] needed some prestigious heft to break the deadlock at the [[Wye River Memorandum|Wye Plantation talks]], he invited Hussein, who was in the US undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer, to attend. Hussein received a standing ovation at the ceremony and praise from Clinton who said:

::“The Jordanian Monarch was at the heart of the diplomatic breakthrough. His [[courage]], [[commitment]], [[wisdom]] and, frankly, stern instruction at certain times, were at the heart of this success. Every time he was in the room, he made us all become a little closer to the people we all would like to see ourselves as being.”{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Though the agreement hashed out at Wye followed the usual, complex course of mid-eastern affairs, Hussein’s input at the conference helped to sway the participants to at least begin to agree.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Illness==
At the end of July 1998 Hussein made public a letter to his brother, Crown Prince Hassan, divulging that his doctors at the [[Mayo Clinic]] thought he had [[lymphatic cancer]]. By the beginning of August they had confirmed it. Hussein's [[lymphoma]] was of a type that responded to [[chemotherapy]], which the King had already begun and his physicians were optimistic he could be cured. Speaking on Jordanian television via [[satellite]], Hussein told his people, "Rest assured, I am not over and done with." Nevertheless, he looked fragile and pale. It was the 62-year-old monarch's second bout with cancer; he lost a kidney to the disease in 1992.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}}

On his way back to Jordan in January 1999, Hussein stopped in [[London]].<ref name="jordanembassyus.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.jordanembassyus.org/011699001.htm |title=King to address Jordanians tonight ahead of Tuesday return |publisher=Jordanembassyus.org |date=1999-01-16 |accessdate=2010-07-01}}</ref> Doctors advised him to rest and stay in England for a few weeks, as he was still too fragile to travel. The King declined. According to sources present, he stated that,

::“I need very much to feel the warmth of my people around me, there is work to be done and I will get the strength from my people to finish the business.“<ref>Mideastnews.com; 8 February 1999</ref>

Piloting his own aircraft<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jordanembassyus.org/011999001.htm |title=King returns today |publisher=Jordanembassyus.org |date=1999-01-19 |accessdate=2010-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Hussein_I_of_Jordan |title=Hussein I of Jordan |publisher=New World Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2010-07-01}}</ref> as he did hundreds of times, he touched down into [[Marka]] military airport, where he was greeted by Royal family members, ministers, parliament members, and Arab and foreign dignitaries. Upon landing, Hussein prayed on the tarmac and insisted, again against doctors advice, on riding in an open white [[limousine]] as his [[motorcade]] passed through downtown Amman, straight to his new home in [[Al Hummar]].<ref name="jordanembassyus.org"/> It was a long journey in the pouring rain, and the king stood bravely greeting an estimated 2 million of his 4.6 million subjects who braved the elements and came out to greet their beloved monarch.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9902/07/king.hussein.obit/chrono/chrono.html | work=CNN | title=Highlights of King Hussein's life | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref>

==Death==
Just before his death, Hussein made a constitutionally allowable change to his will, disinheriting the heir-apparent of several decades, his brother [[Prince Hassan bin Talal|Hassan]], in favor of his eldest son [[Abdullah II of Jordan|Abdullah]]. Then, with a recurrent fever, he abruptly returned to the U.S. clinic on 25 January 1999 for further treatment. He underwent a [[bone marrow transplant]] earlier that week, but the transplant failed, and the king returned home to die.

On 7 February 1999 King Hussein died of complications related to [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]. He was, at the time of his death, one of the longest-serving leaders in international politics.<ref name="CNN1" /> He had been the King of Jordan for over 46 years and in that time was plagued by a single problem that overshadowed every other in his political life: Peace in the Middle East. He did not live to see its resolution even though he is remembered as one whose efforts helped his neighbors, the Israelis and the Palestinians, to live in the peace that eluded him most of his life. In an interview with [[CNN]]'s [[Christiane Amanpour]] in January 1999, Hussein stated:

::“I still feel that those of us who work for [[peace]] and believe in peace have a very, very loud voice, and hopefully, wisdom and [[common sense]] will prevail.“<ref>[[CNN]]/[[Time (magazine)|Time]] “Newsstand” Interviewer: [[Christiane Amanpour]].  24 January 2000</ref>

On 8 February the flag-draped coffin carrying the body of the King left his home which he called the "Door of Peace" Palace after the peace he forged with Israel. All five of his sons were in close attendance and an honor guard of Bedouin troops accompanied the casket of the monarch on a 90-minute procession through the streets of the capital city of Amman. An estimated 800,000 Jordanians (an estimated 20% of the country's population at the time), many of them weeping, braved icy winds to say farewell to their leader.<ref>PBS NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, 1999 Online NewsHour</ref> The funeral was attended by many dignitaries and statesmen from around the world.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20091021125839/http://geocities.com/dagtho/rg-jordankhussein1999.html Geocities.com]</ref> That same day the [[UN General Assembly]] held an Emergency Special Session in "Tribute to the Memory of His Majesty the King of Jordan".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/eed216406b50bf6485256ce10072f637/50fcab40648861c0852569430054859e?OpenDocument |title=U.N.
