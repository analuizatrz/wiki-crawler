'''Hussein bin Talal''' ({{lang-ar|حسين بن طلال}}, ''{{unicode|Ḥusayn bin Ṭalāl}}''; 14 November 1935 – 7 February 1999) was [[List of Kings of Jordan|King]]<ref>[http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/rfamily_immediate.html Family tree on website of King Hussein of Jordan]</ref> of [[Jordan]] from the abdication of his father, [[Talal of Jordan|King Talal]], in 1952, until his death. Hussein's rule extended through the [[Cold War]] and four decades of [[Arab–Israeli conflict]].<ref name="CNN1">{{cite news|title=King Hussein is dead|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9902/07/king.hussein.obit/|publisher=CNN|date=7 February 1999}}</ref> He recognized Israel in 1994, becoming the second Arab head of state to do so (after [[Anwar Sadat]] in 1978/1979).

Hussein claimed to be a descendant of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] through his belonging to the ancient [[Hashemite]] family.<ref name="CNN1" />

==Early life==
King Hussein was born in [[Amman]] on 14 November 1935 to King [[Talal of Jordan|Talal bin Abdullah]] and [[Zein al-Sharaf Talal|Princess Zein al-Sharaf bint Jamil]]. After completing his elementary education in Amman, he was educated at [[Victoria College, Alexandria|Victoria College]] in [[Alexandria]], Egypt. He proceeded to [[Harrow School]] in England, where he befriended his second cousin [[Faisal II of Iraq]]. He pursued further study at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]].

[[File:Hussein bin Talal (1950).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Hussein bin Talal (1950)]]
On 20 July 1951, Prince Hussein traveled to [[Jerusalem]] to perform [[Friday prayers]] at the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] with his grandfather, [[Abdullah I of Jordan|King Abdullah I]], where a Palestinian assassin opened fire on Abdullah and his grandson. Abdullah was killed, but the 15-year-old Hussein survived the assassination attempt, and according to witnesses, pursued the gunman. Witnesses reported that the gunman turned his weapon on the young prince, who was saved when the bullet was deflected by a medal on his uniform which had been given to him by his grandfather.<ref name="CNN1" />

Hussein was appointed Crown Prince of Jordan on 9 September 1951. Abdullah's eldest son, [[Talal of Jordan|Talal]], became [[King of Jordan]], but thirteen months later was forced to abdicate owing to his mental state (European and Arab doctors diagnosed schizophrenia).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalty.nu/MiddleEast/Jordan/Hussein.html|title=The Life of King Hussein|publisher=Royalty|accessdate=1 July 2010}}</ref> King Talal's son, Crown Prince Hussein, was proclaimed King of the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]] on 11 August 1952, succeeding at the age of 16. A Regency Council was appointed until he came of age. He was enthroned on 2 May 1953.<ref name="CNN1" />

==Reign==
[[File:King Hussein in 1955 visit to UK - Royal Hasemite Image.gif|thumb|left|King Hussein on a [[Royal Air Force]] base in 1955.]]
In March 1956, Hussein asserted Jordanian independence by dismissing [[John Bagot Glubb|Glubb Pasha]] as the commander of the Jordanian Army, and replacing all the British officers with Jordanians. This now mainly [[Bedouin]] army was fiercely loyal to him, due to tribal connections.

Hussein's rule was marked by repeated efforts to secure peace in the region. Meetings between King Hussein and Israeli foreign ministers [[Abba Eban]] and [[Golda Meir]] began on or before 1963. Jordan, sharing Israel's longest contiguous border, was interested in maintaining a peaceful coexistence with Israel. [[Avi Shlaim]] claims that Hussein's intentions "...throughout the 1960s was to see if there was any way to resolve the dispute with Israel peacefully."

[[File:Nasser and Hussein at 1964 Arab Summit.jpg|thumb|right|King Hussein (right) and Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] at the [[1964 Arab League summit (Alexandria)|1964 Arab League Summit]] in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]] ]]

King Hussein sought to understand Israel's position and preferred dialogue to the futility of war. Much of this desire grows out of the threat from other Arab states, specifically the Ba'athist regimes in Iraq and Syria and Nasser's ideology of Arab nationalism which had heavily influenced the Army. The first secret meeting took place on 24 September 1963 between King Hussein and Yaacov Herzog, a diplomat with wide experience and special emissary of prime minister [[Levi Eshkol]].<ref>Shlaim 2007, p.&nbsp;194–203 (''Lion of Jordan: The Life of King Hussein in War and Peace'').</ref> Among other things such as discussions regarding water rights, the purpose of the meetings were to plan and support Israeli and Jordanian initiatives in combating [[Fatah]] guerrillas. He would later state "I told them I could not absorb a serious retaliatory raid, and they accepted the logic of this and promised there would never be one".<ref>Bowen 2003, p.&nbsp;26 (citing Amman Cables 1456, 1457, 11 December 1966, National Security Files (Country File: Middle East), LBJ Library (Austin, Texas), Box 146).</ref>

On 13 November 1966, Israeli military conducted a major incursion into Jordanian territory, violating their secret agreement with King Hussein, in what became known as the [[Samu Incident]]. Two days later, in response to the incident, in a memo to [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], his Special Assistant [[Walt Whitman Rostow|Walt Rostow]] wrote: "retaliation is not the point in this case. This 3,000-man raid with tanks and planes was out of all proportion to the provocation and was aimed at the wrong target," and went on to describe the damage done to U.S. and Israeli interests:
<blockquote>They've wrecked a good system of tacit cooperation between Hussein and the Israelis. ... They've undercut Hussein. We've spent $500 million to shore him up as a stabilizing factor on Israel's longest border and vis-à-vis Syria and Iraq. Israel's attack increases the pressure on him to counterattack not only from the more radical Arab governments and from the Palestinians in Jordan but also from the Army, which is his main source of support and may now press for a chance to recoup its Sunday losses. ... They've set back progress toward a long term accommodation with the Arabs. ... They may have persuaded the Syrians that Israel didn't dare attack Soviet-protected Syria but could attack US-backed Jordan with impunity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/www/about_state/history/vol_xviii/zh.html |title=Memorandum From the President's Special Assistant (Rostow) to President Johnson|location=Washington|date=15 November 1966 |accessdate=22 October 2005}}{{dead link|date=February 2014}}</ref></blockquote>

Perception of King Hussein's efforts to come to peaceful terms with Israel led to great dissatisfaction among some Arab leaders.  President [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]] of [[Egypt]] often referred to Hussein as an, "imperialist lackey".<ref name="bbc onthisday">BBC on this Day, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/30/newsid_2493000/2493177.stm Egypt and Jordan unite against Israel]. Retrieved 8 October 2005.</ref> Army Commander-in-Chief General [[Sharif Zaid Ben Shaker]] warned in a press conference that "If Jordan does not join the war a civil war will erupt in Jordan".<ref>quoted in Mutawi 2002, p.&nbsp;102.</ref> In order to maintain credibility in the Arab world and maintain stability at home, on 30 May 1967, King Hussein signed a mutual defense treaty with Egypt.

===Improving the lives of Jordanians===
Early on, King Hussein concentrated on building an economic and industrial infrastructure that would improve the quality of life of Jordanians. During the 1960s, Jordan's main industries – including phosphate, potash and cement – were developed, and a network of highways was built throughout the kingdom.

Social indicators reflect King Hussein's successes. While in 1950, water, sanitation and electricity were available to only 10% of Jordanians, today these reach 99% of the population. In 1960 only 33% of Jordanians were literate, while by 1996, this number had climbed to 85.5%. In 1961, the average Jordanian received a daily intake of 2198 calories, and by 1992, this figure had increased by 37.5% to reach 3022 calories. UNICEF statistics show that between 1981 and 1991, Jordan achieved the world's fastest annual rate of decline in infant mortality – from 70 deaths per 1000 births in 1981 to 37 per 1000 in 1991, a fall of over 47%.

===Six-Day War===
{{Main|Six-Day War}}
In June 1967, as a result of what later became known as the [[Six-Day War]], Jordan lost control of the [[West Bank]] and saw its military shattered. In addition the country was, for a second time, overrun with many Palestinian refugees. As a result, [[Palestinian refugee]]s who fled the 1948 and 1967 wars outnumbered Jordan's natural citizens. Most refugees were provided citizenship by the Jordanian government. Due to their sheer numbers,Palestinian factions in Jordan were able to exercise considerable authority, essentially governing some areas of Jordan, leading to many considering them a state within a state, eroding Hussein's central authority.<ref name=highlights/>

===Black September===
{{Main|Black September in Jordan|l1=Black September}}
In September 1970, Hussein ordered the forcible expulsion of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] by the Jordanian military. The attacks on Palestinian fighters lasted until July 1971, when thousands of Palestinians were expelled, mostly fleeing to Lebanon.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shlaim|first=Avi|year=2007|title=Lion of Jordan; The Life of King Hussein in War and Peace|location=London |publisher=Allen Lane|isbn=978-0-7139-9777-4|pages=301–302}}</ref>

===Yom Kippur War===
{{Main|Yom Kippur War}}
After the 1967 War and the adoption of [[UN Security Council Resolution 242]], [[Gunnar Jarring]] was appointed by the UN as a [[special envoy]] for the Middle East peace process, leading the [[Jarring Mission]]. Both Egypt and Israel responded to Jarring's proposals with support for a peace process, but the process did not move forward.<ref name="response">"[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1947-1974/28%20The%20Jarring%20initiative%20and%20the%20response-%208%20Febr The Jarring initiative and the response]," ''Israel's Foreign Relations'', Selected Documents, vols. 1–2, 1947–1974 . Retrieved 9 June 2005.</ref> Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]] and Syrian president [[Hafez al-Assad]] met King Hussein in 1973 to discuss the possibility of war. Hussein, fearing another loss of territory to Israel, declined. Furthermore, Hussein was suspicious of Sadat's promise to [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] to hand over the West Bank to the Palestinians in the event of a victory, as he considered the [[West Bank]] to be Jordanian territory. On the night of 25 September, Hussein secretly flew to [[Tel Aviv]] by helicopter to warn Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir of an impending Syrian attack.<ref name="Kumaraswamy2013">{{cite book|last=Kumaraswamy|first=P.R.|title=Revisiting the Yom Kippur War|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=g1TkFQgzp5cC&pg=PA14|accessdate=15 July 2014|date=2013-01-11|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136328954|page=14}}</ref> "Are (the Syrians) going to war without the Egyptians, asked Mrs. Meir.

[[File:King Hussein of Jordan 1980.ogv|thumb|left|King Hussein meeting Jimmy Carter and being interviewed in 1980]]
On 6 October 1973, Syria and Egypt attacked Israel without the aid of Jordan. A ceasefire was declared on 23 October, but fighting continued until January 1974. The [[Camp David Accords]] were signed by Egyptian President Anwar El Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin on 17 September 1978, after 14 months of diplomatic efforts by Egypt, Israel, and the United States.

===Peace with Israel===
{{Main|Israel–Jordan Treaty of Peace}}
{{Wikisource|Hussein of Jordan's Speech at Rabin's Funeral}}
In 1994, Hussein concluded negotiations to end the official state of war with [[Israel]] resulting in the [[Israel–Jordan Treaty of Peace]] which he had begun negotiating in secret with the Israelis in the 1960s. Between 1963 and 1994 he had held at least 55 secret meetings with leading Israelis including at least seven prime and foreign ministers.<ref>''The Economist'', 24 November 2007, p.88</ref>

Due to the close relationship forged with Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] during the negotiations of the treaty, Hussein was invited to give a speech during Rabin's funeral.

====Summit of the Peacemakers====
On 13 March 1996, the "Summit of the Peacemakers" was held at [[Sharm el-Sheikh]], Egypt hosted by Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]]. In addition to King Hussein, Turkish President [[Süleyman Demirel]], Israeli Prime Minister [[Shimon Peres]], US President [[Bill Clinton]], and Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] were present at the summit. The summit was convened with the expressed aim of putting the Israeli-Palestinian peace process back on track after a period of increased tension and hostility.

===Hebron Agreement===
{{Main|Hebron Agreement}}
Hussein was often involved in negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians. His 11th-hour intervention in January 1997 is said to have brought Palestinian chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] and Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] to an agreement on the long-awaited withdrawal of Israeli troops from most of the [[West Bank]] town of [[Hebron]].

===Khaled Meshaal assassination attempt===
On 27 September 1997, the treaty was thrown into jeopardy when two [[Mossad]] agents attempted to poison [[Khaled Meshaal]], who was at the time living in Jordan. Condemning the attack as a violation of Jordanian sovereignty, King Hussein threatened to void the treaty if Meshaal died. Jordanian doctors determined and administered the proper antidote in time, just as Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] bowed to international pressure and ordered Mossad to hand it over. Meshaal recovered, and relations between Jordan and Israel thawed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/aljazeeraworld/2013/01/201312210472621589.html#parttwo|title=Kill Him Silently|date=30 January 2013|work=Al Jazeera World|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=30 January 2013}}</ref>

===Wye River Memorandum===
{{Main|Wye River Memorandum}}
In October 1998 U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] invited Hussein, who was in the US undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer, to attend the [[Wye River Memorandum|Wye Plantation talks]]. Hussein received a standing ovation at the ceremony and praise from Clinton.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Illness===
At the end of July 1998, it was made public that Hussein was diagnosed with [[lymphatic cancer]] by doctors at the [[Mayo Clinic]]. Hussein's [[lymphoma]] was of a type that responded to [[chemotherapy]], which the King had already begun and his physicians were optimistic he could be cured. Speaking on Jordanian television via [[satellite]], Hussein reassured the Jordanian people that the cancer was curable. Nevertheless, he looked fragile and pale. It was the 62-year-old monarch's second bout with cancer; he lost a kidney to the disease in 1992.<ref>[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-02-07/news/9902090326_1_king-hussein-prince-abdullah-jordan King Hussein's eldest son handed power in Jordan]</ref>

On his way back to Jordan in January 1999, Hussein stopped in London.<ref name="jordanembassyus.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.jordanembassyus.org/011699001.htm|title=King to address Jordanians tonight ahead of Tuesday return|publisher=Jordan embassy|date=16 January 1999|accessdate=1 July 2010}}{{dead link|date=February 2014}}</ref> Doctors advised him to rest and stay in England for a few weeks, as he was still too fragile to travel. According to Jordanian government sources, Hussein stated that:

::"I need very much to feel the warmth of my people around me, there is work to be done and I will get the strength from my people to finish the business."<ref>Mideastnews.com; 8 February 1999</ref>

Upon returning to Jordan Hussein was greeted by family members, ministers, parliament members, foreign dignitaries and crowds of Jordanian citizens, estimated by Jordanian government officials of 3 million.<ref name=highlights>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9902/07/king.hussein.obit/chrono/chrono.html|publisher=CNN|title=Highlights of King Hussein's life| accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref>

==Death==
{{Main|Death and state funeral of King Hussein}}
Just before his death, Hussein made a change to his will revising the law of succession, which earlier had designated his brother [[Prince Hassan bin Talal|Hassan]] successor, in favour of his eldest son [[Abdullah II of Jordan|Abdullah]]. He abruptly returned to the U.S. clinic on 25 January 1999 for further treatment undergoing a failed [[bone marrow transplant]] after which he returned to Jordan.

On 7 February 1999, King Hussein died of complications related to [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]. He was, at the time of his death, one of the longest-serving leaders in international politics.<ref name="CNN1" /> He had been the King of Jordan for over 46 years, during which he was an important actor in various Middle East conflicts. Just prior to his death, during an interview with [[CNN]]'s [[Christiane Amanpour]] Hussein expressed his opinion that a peaceful resolution would eventually be reached in the Arab–Israeli conflict.<ref>[[CNN]]/''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' "Newsstand" Interviewer: [[Christiane Amanpour]]. 24 January 2000</ref>

King Hussein's funeral was held on 8 February 1999 in the presence of all five of his sons, foreign dignitaries and statesmen, and an estimated 800,000 Jordanians.<ref>PBS NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, 1999 Online NewsHour</ref><ref>{{Wayback |date=20091021125839 |url=http://geocities.com/dagtho/rg-jordankhussein1999.html |title=Geocities.com}}{{dead link|date=February 2014}}</ref> The [[UN General Assembly]] held an Emergency Special Session in "Tribute to the Memory of His Majesty the King of Jordan" on the same day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/eed216406b50bf6485256ce10072f637/50fcab40648861c0852569430054859e?OpenDocument|title=U.N.

==Personal life==
Hussein was an enthusiastic [[ham radio]] operator and an Honorary Member of the [[The Radio Society of Harrow]] and a life member of the American Radio Relay League (ARRL)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arrl.org/w1aw-bulletins-archive/ARLX001/1999|title=In Memory of JY1|accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref>

Hussein was a trained pilot, flying both airplanes and helicopters as a hobby. In a 1999 interview [[Henry Kissinger]] described being flown by Hussein, saying that "...he was a daring pilot, and he would be zooming along at treetop level, and my wife, in order to be politely insistent would say, "You know I didn't know helicopters could fly so low" "Oh!" said the king, "They can fly lower!" and went below tree top level just skimming along on the ground. That really aged me rapidly."<ref name="ReferenceA">Nightline: Hussein of Jordan, ABC Evening News for Friday, Feb 05, 1999</ref>

Hussein was also a collector of motorcycles.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The cover of the paperback version of [[Queen Noor of Jordan|Queen Noor's]] book ''[[Leap of Faith: Memoirs of an Unexpected Life]]'' features a photo of the King and Queen riding a [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle.
