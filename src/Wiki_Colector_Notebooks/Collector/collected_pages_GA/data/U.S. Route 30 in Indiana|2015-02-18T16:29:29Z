'''U.S. Route 30''' ('''US&nbsp;30''') is a road in the [[United States Numbered Highway System]] that runs from [[Astoria, Oregon]] to [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. In Indiana, the route runs from the Illinois state line at [[Dyer, Indiana|Dyer]] to the Ohio state line east of [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] and [[New Haven, Indiana|New Haven]].  The {{convert| 155.96 |mi|km|2}} of US&nbsp;30 that lie within Indiana serve as a major conduit.  The entire length of U.S. Route 30 in Indiana is included in the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] (NHS). The highway includes four-lane, rural sections, an urbanized, four-lane divided expressway, and several high-traffic, six-lane areas.  First designated as a US Highway in 1926, US&nbsp;30 replaced the original State Road 2 (SR&nbsp;2) and SR&nbsp;44 designation of the highway which dated back to the formation of the Indiana State Road system.  A section of the highway originally served as part of the [[Lincoln Highway]].  Realignment and construction projects have expanded the highway to four lanes across the state.

== Route description ==
US&nbsp;30 enters [[Dyer, Indiana|Dyer]] from [[Lynwood, Illinois]] along the original alignment of the [[Lincoln Highway in Indiana|Lincoln Highway]], as a four-lane divided highway.  At Moeller Street, the roadway becomes a four-lane highway with a center turn lane before reaching an [[at-grade intersection]] with [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] railroad tracks.  Thereafter, the road returns to four-lane divided highway before a [[traffic light]] at [[U.S. Route 41 in Indiana|US&nbsp;41]] in [[Schererville, Indiana|Schererville]] and passing under [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]] railroad tracks.  After US&nbsp;41, the original alignment of the Lincoln Highway leaves US&nbsp;30 and continues along the same route as old [[Indiana State Road 330|State Road 330]] (SR&nbsp;330).  US&nbsp;30 begins to curve towards the southeast, still as a four-lane divided highway.  The highway has a traffic light at [[Indiana State Road 55|SR&nbsp;55]], heading east as the roadway enters [[Merrillville, Indiana|Merrillville]], where the route becomes a six-lane divided highway and has an interchange at [[Interstate 65 in Indiana|Interstate 65]] (I-65).  At Colorado Street in Merrillville, the road narrows back to a four-lane divided highway.<ref name="Google Maps" /><ref name="INDOT 2012 Map" /><ref name="INDOT Railroad map" />

[[File:US Route 30 in Indiana.jpg|thumb|left|310px|US Route 30 in Indiana.]]
After a traffic light at the southern terminus of [[Indiana State Road 51|SR&nbsp;51]] in [[Hobart, Indiana|Hobart]], the original alignment of the Lincoln Highway rejoins US&nbsp;30.  The highway passes through a mix of farmland and residential properties on the way to [[Valparaiso, Indiana|Valparaiso]], entering the city and passing through commercial properties.  The highway has a traffic light at [[Indiana State Road 2|SR&nbsp;2]] at the western end of the concurrency of the two roads.  From there, the road crosses railroad tracks, passes south of [[Valparaiso University]], and has a traffic light at the eastern terminus of [[Indiana State Road 130|SR&nbsp;130]].  After passing the traffic light at SR&nbsp;130, the road has a full interchange with [[Indiana State Road 49|SR&nbsp;49]] and the eastern terminus of the [[Indiana State Road 2|SR&nbsp;2]] and US 30 concurrency.  Continuing east, the road passes the [[Porter County Municipal Airport]] and proceeds east-southeast from Valparaiso, towards [[Plymouth, Indiana|Plymouth]]. Along this segment, US 30 passes through rural farmland, with an intersection at [[U.S. Route 421 in Indiana|US&nbsp;421]] and an at-grade railroad crossing with the [[Chesapeake and Indiana Railroad]].  East of the railroad tracks is an intersection with [[Indiana State Road 39|SR&nbsp;39]] and an interchange at [[U.S. Route 35 in Indiana|US&nbsp;35]].<ref name="Google Maps" /><ref name="INDOT 2012 Map" /><ref name="INDOT Railroad map" />

US 30 runs along the north side of Plymouth, passing through an interchange with the northern terminus of [[Indiana State Road 17|SR&nbsp;17]] and near the [[Plymouth Municipal Airport (Indiana)|Plymouth Municipal Airport]].  The route curves around the northeast side of the city, having an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31 in Indiana|US&nbsp;31]] and heading southeast towards [[Warsaw, Indiana|Warsaw]].  At [[Bourbon, Indiana|Bourbon]], the highway has an interchange with [[Indiana State Road 331|SR&nbsp;331]].  The road curves east before entering Warsaw and has an interchange with [[Indiana State Road 15|SR&nbsp;15]], south of the [[Warsaw Municipal Airport (Indiana)|Warsaw Municipal Airport]].  After passing the airport, the road enters a mix of commercial and residential properties and has a traffic light at an old alignment of the Lincoln Highway, before passing north of [[Winona Lake, Indiana|Winona Lake]] and heading towards [[Columbia City, Indiana|Columbia City]].  At Columbia City, the road turns southeast and has traffic lights at [[Indiana State Road 109|SR&nbsp;109]], [[Indiana State Road 9|SR&nbsp;9]], and [[Indiana State Road 205|SR&nbsp;205]].  After SR&nbsp;205, US&nbsp;30 heads east towards [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], paralleling the Chicago, Fort Wayne and Eastern Railroad.  The route crosses into [[Allen County, Indiana|Allen County]] at a traffic light at County Line Road.<ref name="Google Maps" /><ref name="INDOT 2012 Map" /><ref name="INDOT Railroad map" />

[[File:US 30 west of Fort Wayne, Indiana.jpg|thumb|right|325px|U.S. Route 30 west of Fort Wayne, Indiana.]]
The highway enters Fort Wayne with a traffic light at Kroemer Road and a [[interchange (road)#Trumpet interchange|trumpet interchange]] with [[U.S. Route 33 in Indiana|US&nbsp;33]], at the western terminus of US 33's concurrency with US 30, and proceeds east-southeast towards an interchange with [[Interstate 69 in Indiana|I-69]] as a six-lane divided highway.  At the [[diamond interchange]] with I-69, US&nbsp;33 runs south on I-69, while US&nbsp;30 continues north, concurrent with both I-69 and [[U.S. Route 24 in Indiana|US 24]]; the road itself continues east as [[Indiana State Road 930|SR 930]] and as Goshen Road.  US 30's concurrency with I-69 is a six-lane urban interstate with interchanges at Lima Road ([[U.S. Route 27 in Indiana|US&nbsp;27]] and [[Indiana State Road 3|SR&nbsp;3]]) and Coldwater Road (formerly [[Indiana State Road 327|SR&nbsp;327]] and US&nbsp;27).   At the interchange of I-69 and [[Interstate 469|I-469]], US 30 heads east concurrent with I-469 around the north and east sides of Fort Wayne, towards [[New Haven, Indiana|New Haven]].  The highway is a four-lane interstate passing through a mix of farmland and residential properties.  Proceeding east, the interstate crosses the [[St. Joseph River (Maumee River)|St. Joseph River]] and has an interchange at Maplecrest Road before turning south around the northeast side of Fort Wayne to subsequent interchanges with [[Indiana State Road 37|SR&nbsp;37]] followed by US&nbsp;24.  After the US&nbsp;24 interchange, the highway crosses the [[Maumee River]] and Norfolk Southern railroad tracks before leaving I-469 east of downtown New Haven at the eastern terminus of [[Indiana State Road 930|SR&nbsp;930]].  After I-469, US&nbsp;30 heads southeast away from New Haven, passing through rural farmland as a four-lane divided highway.  The route has an intersection at [[Indiana State Road 101|SR&nbsp;101]] before entering Ohio, heading toward [[Van Wert, Ohio|Van Wert]].<ref name="Google Maps">{{google maps |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Joliet+St&daddr=U.S.+30+E&hl=en&ll=40.95916,-86.154785&spn=2.439162,4.581299&sll=40.997994,-84.803494&sspn=0.00119,0.002237&geocode=FTAoeQId8XjI-g%3BFcCUcQIdVADy-g&mra=me&mrsp=1,0&sz=19&t=h&z=8|title=Overview of US&nbsp;30 in Indiana |accessdate=August 20, 2012}}</ref><ref name="INDOT 2012 Map">{{cite map|url=http://www.in.gov/indot/files/StateTransportationMap.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Indiana Department of Transportation|title=Indiana Transportation Map|year=2011-12|section=A3-A5|accessdate=August 20, 2012|cartography=INDOT}}</ref><ref name="INDOT Railroad map">{{cite map |publisher= Indiana Department of Transportation |date= August 23, 2011 |url= http://www.in.gov/indot/files/MAIN-RR-11_V1.pdf |title= Indiana Railroad Map |format= PDF |cartography= INDOT |accessdate=August 20, 2012}}</ref>

The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state highways as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called [[average annual daily traffic]] (AADT), calculated along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2010, INDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were 10,870&nbsp;vehicles and 4,750 commercial vehicles used the highway daily between US&nbsp;31 and SR&nbsp;331. The peak traffic volumes were 69,280&nbsp;vehicles and 12,660 commercial vehicles AADT along the section of US&nbsp;30 that is concurrent with I-69, between the Lima Road and Coldwater Road exits in Fort Wayne.<ref name="AADT">{{cite web |url=http://dotmaps.indot.in.gov/apps/trafficcounts/|title= INDOT Traffic Zones|publisher=Indiana Department of Transportation |year=2010 |accessdate=August 20, 2012}}</ref>
