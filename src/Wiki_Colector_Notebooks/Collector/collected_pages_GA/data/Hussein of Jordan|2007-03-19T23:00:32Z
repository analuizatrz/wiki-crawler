'''Hussein I bin Talal, King of Jordan''' ({{lang-ar|حسين بن طلال}} ''{{unicode|Ḥusayn bin Ṭalāl}}''; [[November 14]], [[1935]] – [[February 7]], [[1999]]). He ascended after the [[1952]] [[abdication]] of his father, [[King Talal]]. 

== Life and career ==
===Life before becoming king===
Hussein completed his Junior High Education in [[Jordan]], and then moved to [[Victoria College, Alexandria|Victoria College]] in [[Alexandria]] and [[Harrow School]] in [[England]], and then to [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] to complete his education.
===Death of King Abdullah I===
On [[July 20]], [[1951]], [[Abdullah I of Jordan|King Abdullah I]] traveled to [[Jerusalem]] to perform his [[Friday prayers]] with his young grandson, Prince Hussein. He was assassinated by a gunman at the instigation of Colonel Abdullah Tell, ex-Military Governor of Jerusalem, and Dr. Musa Abdullah Husseini, on the steps of one of the holiest shrines of Islam, [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]]. The assailant shot at Hussein, but the young prince is said to have been saved by a bullet fortuitously striking a medal that his grandfather had recently awarded him and insisted he wear.

===Accession===
[[Image:King Kigeli V of Rwanda meets with King Hussein.jpg|left|200px|thumb|[[King Kigeli V of Rwanda]] (right) meets with King Hussein of Jordan in 1967]]

Abdullah's eldest son, [[King Talal]] was crowned as [[King of Jordan|King]], but within a year was forced to abdicate because of poor mental condition (he allegedly suffered from [[schizophrenia]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}}). His son Crown Prince Hussein was proclaimed King of the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]] on [[August 11]], [[1952]], at the age of 16, which was under the legal age, so he was enthroned one year later, on [[May 2]], [[1953]].

===Reign===
{{Hashemite-Jordan}}
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[image:hussein33.JPG|left|thumb|200px|king Hussein at the Battle front]]  -->
His reign was controversial, and he is described as an opportunist by some political historians. While it saw Jordan remain one of the Western sanctuaries and protectorates in the Middle East, it was also marked by the events of [[Black September in Jordan|Black September]] when the king ordered the violent expulsion of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] from the country. The country also defied the West and the other allied leaders by refusing to side against [[Saddam Hussein]] in the [[Gulf War]] &mdash; allegedly done for internal political reasons after the Ma'an uprising in 1988 that threatened the throne of the King &mdash; which alienated the kingdom from most of the [[Arab world]].  In [[1994]] King Hussein concluded negotiations to end the official state of war with [[Israel]] resulting in the [[Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace]] which he had begun negotiating in secret with the Israelis in the 1970s. The king wrote three books: ''Uneasy Lies the Head'' ([[1962]]), about his childhood and early years as king; ''My War With Israel'' ([[1969]]); and ''Mon Métier de Roi''.  According to [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] in his book ''A Durable Peace'' ([[1993]], revised [[2000]]), Hussein had motivation for obtaining peace with Israel unofficially; indeed, Netanyahu claims Hussein flew to Tel Aviv the day before the Yom Kippur War in secret to warn the Israeli authorities of an imminent attack, and Israeli policy towards Jordan was to guarantee its security by intervening in any attack on its territory (this was directed specifically at Syria and Iraq). 

====After the peace treaty====

King Hussein developed strong ties of friendship with Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]], with whom he had negotiated the peace treaty. King Hussein gave a powerful speech at the funeral of  Yitzhak Rabin:
{{Further|[[Hussein of Jordan's Speech at Rabin's Funeral]]}}
::''My sister, Mrs. Leah Rabin, my friends, I had never thought that the moment would come like this when I would grieve the loss of a brother, a colleague and a friend - a man, a soldier who met us on the opposite side of a divide whom we respected as he respected us. A man I came to know because I realized, as he did, that we have to cross over the divide, establish a dialogue, get to know each other and strive to leave for those who follow us a legacy that is worthy of them. And so we did. And so we became brethren and friends.''

====Improvements in Jordan====
Though King Hussein did many controversial things during his reign, he was appreciated by the Jordanian population for his accomplishments. In the [[Six-day war]], the king held onto his throne, and put growth into Jordan's economy, doubling the annual output from 1956 to 1963.<ref>{{cite news|title=King Hussein is dead: A fateful decision in the Six-Day War|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9902/07/king.hussein.obit/|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=[[1999-02-07]]}}</ref> He helped Jordan develop and become more stable. For example, at the beginning of his reign, he paid attention to the development of better water and electricity networks, in addition to sewage networks, which were only available to 10% of the population; by the end of his reign, the percentage had reached 99%. In addition, the [[Literacy rate]] of Jordan was 33%, rising to 85.5% in 1996 and still increasing. Other accomplishments include Calories available per individuals, which rose by about 50%, and the reduction in the infant mortality rate.

===Death===

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[image:kinghussein44.JPG|left|thumb|250px|King Hussein Funeral]] -->
He died of complications related to [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] on [[February 7]], [[1999]]. The King had been suffering from the disease for many years and had been treated at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota]], [[United States]] on a fairly regular basis.  Just before his death, he changed his will and the Jordanian Constitution in order to disinherit his brother, [[Prince Hassan of Jordan|Hassan]], who had been crown prince for several decades, and designated his eldest son, [[Abdullah II of Jordan|Abdullah]] as heir. Then, with a recurrent fever, abruptly returned to the U.S. clinic January 25 for further treatment. He underwent a [[bone marrow transplant]] earlier that week, but the transplant failed, and the king returned home to die. The King was, at the time of his death, one of the longest-serving leaders in international politics.<ref>{{cite news|title=King Hussein is dead|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9902/07/king.hussein.obit/|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=[[1999-02-07]]}}</ref>

==Personal life==
King Hussein was married four times, although he was never married to more than one woman at the same time: his four wives were

* '''[[Sharifa Dina bint 'Abdu'l-Hamid]]''', an [[Egypt]]ian-born third cousin of King Hussein's father, [[King Talal]], on [[April 18]], [[1955]]. A graduate of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] and a former lecturer in [[English literature]] at [[Cairo University]], the bride was 26 to the groom's 19.  They separated in [[1956]] and were divorced in [[1957]], at which time [[Queen Dina]] became known as [[Sharifa Dina bint 'Abdu'l-Hamid|Her Royal Highness Princess Dina Abdul-Hamid of Jordan]].  She became an Egyptian citizen in [[1963]], and in October [[1970]], Princess Dina of [[Jordan]] married [[Asad Sulayman Abd al-Qadir]], alias [[Salah Taamari]], a Palestinian [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] commando who became a high-ranking official in the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]].
**Daughter: [[Princess Alia bint Al Hussein|H.R.H.Princess Alia bint Al Hussein]] (born [[1956]]).  Married first ([[1977]], divorced [[1987]]) [[Sayyid Nasser Mirza]] and second ([[1988]]) [[Sayyid Mohammed Al-Saleh]].  Has issue by both.

* '''[[Princess Muna al-Hussein|Antoinette Avril Gardiner]] ('[[Princess Muna al-Hussein|Toni Gardiner]]')''', (born [[Chelmondiston]], [[England]], [[1941]], styled [[Princess Muna al-Hussein|HRH Princess Muna al-Hussein]] from [[May 25]], [[1961]]).  An award-winning field hockey player, former typist, and daughter of a British army officer turned innkeeper, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Walter Percy Gardiner]], she was given the title [[Princess Muna al-Hussein|Her Royal Highness Princess Muna al-Hussein]] and retained this title after they divorced in [[1972]].<br>It is often thought that Princess Muna al-Hussein never converted to Islam. However, the Jordanian Constitution at Chapter VI Part I Article 28e specifically requires that every person with rights of succession to the Jordainan throne be born of a legitimate wife who is Muslim.  The fact that the current King (Abdullah II) is the son of Princess Muna al-Hussein proves that Princess Muna did, indeed, convert to Islam.  If Muna had not converted to Islam Abdullah II, Prince Faisal and their issue would not have the hereditary rights that they enjoy.
