'''Nevado Chachani''' is the highest of the volcanoes near the city of [[Arequipa]] in southern [[Peru]].  Its name means “skirt” in [[Quechua language|Quechua]], and a female character is normally attributed to the mountain in local legends. 

Because of the very low precipitation in the Arequipa area, Chachani does not have a permanent ice cap or [[glacier]]s.  The ascent to the summit is therefore non-technical, and can be attempted by inexperienced climbers. Climbing Chachani is popular with tourists, and many tour agencies in Arequipa offer guided trips to the summit, though the altitude is considered challenging for those who are not fully acclimated. 

The mountain is normally climbed from its northern side, which is reached by four-wheel drive vehicle, turning off from the main highway near [[Pampas Cañahuas]].  Base camp is at approximately 5,200 metres. Climbers cross the face of adjacent mountains El Angel and Fatima before ascending to the summit of Chachani itself.

The standard route requires crampons and an ice axe, but does not require roping up, as there are no crevasses on Chachani. Two traverses over relatively steep terrain constitute the main challenges on the way to the summit. The final push to the summit is a steep scree slope, which provides for a fast descent back to the first traverse. 

Average total climb time from base camp ranges from six to eight hours, with a two to three hour descent.
