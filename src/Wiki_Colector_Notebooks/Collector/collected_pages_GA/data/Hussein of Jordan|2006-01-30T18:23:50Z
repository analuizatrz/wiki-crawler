'''Hussein bin Talal''' ({{lang-ar|حسين بن طلال}} ''{{unicode|Ḥussayn bin Ṭalāl}}''; [[November 14]], [[1935]] &ndash; [[February 7]], [[1999]]) was the [[King of Jordan|King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]] from [[1952]] to [[1999]]. He ascended after the [[1952]] [[abdication]] of his father, [[King Talal]]. It was rumoured the British never liked King Talal for his views and nationalist tendencies.

== Life and career ==
On [[July 20]], [[1951]], [[Abdullah I of Jordan|King Abdullah I]] traveled to [[Jerusalem]] to perform his [[Friday prayers]] with his young grandson, Prince Hussein. He was assassinated by a gunman at the instigation of Colonel Abdullah Tell, ex-Military Governor of Jerusalem, and Dr Musa Abdullah Husseini, on the steps of one of the holiest shrines of Islam, the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]]. The assailant shot at Hussine, but the young prince is said to have been saved by a bullet fortuitously striking a medal that his grandfather had recently awarded him and insisted he wear. 

Abdullah's eldest son, [[King Talal]] was crowned as [[King of Jordan|King]], but within a year was forced to abdicate because of 'mental illness'. His son Prince Hussein was proclaimed King of the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]] on [[August 11]], [[1952]] at the age of 16 and was enthroned on [[May 2]], [[1953]].

His reign was controversial. While it saw Jordan remain one of the Western sanctuaries and protectorates in the Middle East, it was also marked by the events of [[Black September in Jordan|Black September]] when the king ordered the violent expulsion of the [[PLO]] from the country. The country also defied the west and the other allied leaders by siding with [[Saddam Hussein]] in the [[Gulf War]] - done for purely internal political reasons after the Ma'an uprising in 1988 that threatened the throne of the King - which alienated the kingdom from most of the [[Arab world]].  In [[1994]] King Hussein concluded negotiations to end the official state of war with the [[State of Israel]] resulting in the [[Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace]] which he had begun secretly in the 70s with the Israelis. The king wrote three books: ''Uneasy Lies the Head'' ([[1962]]), about his childhood and early years as king, ''My War With Israel'' ([[1969]]), and ''Mon Métier de Roi''.  According to [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] in his book ''A Durable Peace'' ([[1993]], revised [[2000]]), Hussein had motivation for obtaining peace with Israel unofficially; indeed, Netanyahu claims Hussein flew to Tel Aviv the day before the Yom Kippur War in secret to warn the Israeli authorities of an imminent attack, and Israeli policy towards Jordan was to guarentee its security by intervening in any attack on its territory (this was directed specifically at Syria and Iraq). 

King Hussein was an avid [[amateur radio]] operator. He also loved to fly airplanes (prop and jet) as well as helicopters. 

He died of complications related to [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] on [[February 7]], [[1999]]. The King had been suffering from the disease for many years and had visited the [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota]], [[United States]] on a fairly regular basis for treatment.  Just before his death, he changed his will and The Jordanian Constitution in order to disinherit his brother, [[Prince Hassan of Jordan|Hassan]], who had been crown prince for several decades, and designated his eldest son, [[Abdullah II of Jordan|Abdullah]] as heir. The King was at the time of his death one of the longest serving leaders in international politics.
