'''Hussein bin Talal''' ({{lang-ar|حسين بن طلال}}, ''{{unicode|Ḥusayn bin Ṭalāl}}'') ([[Amman]], [[November 14]], [[1935]] – [[Amman]], [[February 7]], [[1999]]) was the [[List of Kings of Jordan|King]] of [[Jordan]] from the abdication of his father, [[Talal of Jordan|King Talal]], in 1952, until his death. Hussein guided his country in the context of the [[Cold War]], and through four decades of [[Arab-Israeli conflict]], balancing the pressures of [[Arab nationalism]], the burdens of sheltering a large [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] refugee population, and the allure of Western-style development against the stark reality of Jordan's geographic location.<ref name="CNN1">{{cite news|title=King Hussein is dead|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9902/07/king.hussein.obit/|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=[[1999-02-07]]}}</ref> His commitment to [[democracy]], [[civil liberties]] and [[human rights]] helped to make Jordan a model state for the [[Middle East]], and the kingdom is internationally recognized for having the most exemplary human rights record in that region.<ref>http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=4673</ref> He worked tirelessly and continuously throughout his life to advance the cause of peace between [[Jordan]] and [[Israel]] (which he successfully achieved in 1994), as well as between [[Palestinians]] and [[Israelis]].

Hussein's family claims a line of descent from the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]. "We are the family of the prophet and we are the oldest tribe in the Arab world", the king once said of his [[Hashemite]] ancestry.<ref name="CNN1" />

==Early life and accession==

Hussein was born in Amman on November 14, 1935, to then Prince Talal bin Abdullah and [[Zein al Sharaf Talal|Princess Zein al-Sharaf bint Jamil]]. After completing his elementary education in Amman, he was educated at [[Victoria College, Alexandria|Victoria College]] in [[Alexandria]]. He proceeded to [[Harrow School]] in [[England]], where he befriended his cousin [[Faisal II of Iraq]]. He pursued further study at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]].

[[Image:Young.king.jpg|left|200px|thumb|In 1952, Hussein bin Talal was named King of Jordan]]

On July 20, 1951, Prince Hussein traveled to [[Jerusalem]] to perform [[Friday prayers]] at the  [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] with his grandfather, [[Abdullah I of Jordan|King Abdullah I]]. A Palestinian extremist, fearing the king might negotiate a peace with the newly created state of Israel, opened fire on Abdullah and his grandson. Abdullah was killed, but the 15-year-old Hussein survived, and turned to pursue the gunman. The assailant turned his weapon on the young prince, who was saved when the bullet was deflected by a medal on his uniform given to him by his grandfather.<ref name="CNN1" />

In his autobiography, ''Uneasy Lies the Head'', Hussein recalls how three days before that fateful day in Jerusalem, his grandfather turned to him and said:

::''“I hope you realize, my son, that one day you will have to assume responsibility. I look to you to do your very best to see that my work is not lost. I look to you to continue it in the service of our people.”''<ref>Hussein of Jordan, HM King. Uneasy Lies the Head. London: Heinemann, 1962</ref>

He was appointed Crown Prince of Jordan on [[September 9]], [[1951]]. Abdullah's eldest son, [[King Talal]], was crowned [[King of Jordan]], but within a year was forced to abdicate owing to his mental state (European and Arab doctors diagnosed schizophrenia).<ref>[http://www.royalty.nu/MiddleEast/Jordan/Hussein.html Royalty.nu - Royalty in Jordan - The Life of King Hussein<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> King Talal's son, Crown Prince Hussein, was proclaimed King of the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]] on [[August 11]], [[1952]], succeeding at the age of 16; because this was under the legal age, he was enthroned a year later, on May 2, 1953.<ref name="CNN1" />

==Reign==

In March 1956 Hussein established his firm authority over Jordan, and burnished his own nationalist credentials by dismissing [[John Bagot Glubb|Glubb “Pasha”]] as the commander of the Jordanian Army, and replacing all the British officers with Jordanians. This now mainly [[Bedouin]] army was fiercely loyal to him, not just because the monarchy and the [[East Bank]] Bedouin tribes depended upon each other but also because, in personal style, Hussein was a classic Bedouin leader.

He navigated Jordan through turbulent years and maintained Jordan's reputation as an oasis of stability. After the [[Six Day War]], Hussein opened Jordan's borders and welcomed well over a million [[Palestinian]] refugees and almost instantly gave them Jordanian citizenship giving them free access to healthcare and an education. He heavily invested in human capital in his 40+ years as King. As a result, Jordan had the most advanced health and education systems in the Arab World. The King Hussein Medical City became the regional hub for treatment and surgery. 

In 1991, together with an executive royal council, Hussein created the National Charter which reaffirmed democratic principles and lifted martial law. Opposition movements and political parties were legalized and freedom of the press was reaffirmed.

Throughout his reign Hussein was notoriously lenient in his treatment of political opponents, even those who had plotted against his person and his throne. And even though he understood that his country may have been a weak state in terms of its military and economic resources, he consistently exercised considerable political influence both through his [[Morality|moral authority]] and his subtle grasp of the hopes and fears of others. According to biographer Nigel Ashton: "[[Empathy]] was his most useful tool in regional politics."<ref>"King Hussein of Jordan: A Political Life" by Nigel Ashton. Yale University Press (2008)</ref> 

==Six-Day War==
{{Main|Six-Day War}}
In mid-1967, Jordan joined Egypt and Syria to fight Israel in the Six Day War. Jordan lost control of the [[West Bank]] and east Jerusalem and saw its military shattered, but Hussein shored up his support among the country's growing Palestinian population.<ref name="CNN2">[http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9902/07/king.hussein.obit/chrono/chrono.html CNN - Highlights of King Hussein's life]</ref>

==Black September==
{{Main|Black September in Jordan|l1=Black September}}
In September, 1970 Hussein ordered the forcible expulsion of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], which were attempting to foment a civil war, from the country.

==The Gulf War==
{{Hashemite-Jordan}}
{{Main|Gulf War}}
The country also defied the West and the other allied leaders by refusing to side against [[Saddam Hussein]] in the [[Gulf War]] &mdash; allegedly done for internal political reasons after the [[Ma'an uprising]] in 1988 that threatened the throne of the King &mdash; which alienated the kingdom from most of the [[Arab world]].

==Peace with Israel==
{{Main|Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace}}

In 1994, Hussein concluded negotiations to end the official state of war with [[Israel]] resulting in the [[Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace]] which he had begun negotiating in secret with the Israelis in the 1960s. Between 1963 &mdash; 1994 he had held at least 55 secret meetings with leading Israelis including at least seven prime and foreign ministers.<ref>(''The Economist'', 11/24/07, p.88) </ref> At the signing of the treaty at [[Wadi Araba]] on October 26, Hussein described the event as the beginning of:

::''“Mutual [[respect]] between us all, [[tolerance]], and the coming together of people, of generations to come beyond this time, to build and achieve what is worthy of them..."''<ref>http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/speeches_letters.html</ref>

During the negotiations of the treaty Hussein developed strong ties of friendship with Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]].  On November 6, 1995 Hussein gave a powerful speech at the funeral of his friend:

:''Full text: [[wikisource:Hussein of Jordan's Speech at Rabin's Funeral]]''

::''“My sister, Mrs. Leah Rabin, my friends, I had never thought that the moment would come like this when I would grieve the loss of a brother, a colleague and a friend — a man, a soldier who met us on the opposite side of a divide whom we respected as he respected us. A man I came to know because I realized, as he did, that we have to cross over the divide, establish a dialogue, get to know each other and strive to leave for those who follow us a legacy that is worthy of them. And so we did. And so we became brethren and friends... And as I stand here, I am obliged to you, to my people in Jordan and to the world, to keep on doing the utmost to guarantee that we leave behind a similar inheritance.“''<ref>[http://www.danielpipes.org/article/4255 Transcript from CNN life coverage by Daniel Pipes]</ref>

==Summit of the Peacemakers==

On March 13, 1996 the “Summit of the Peacemakers” was held at [[Sharm el-Sheikh]], [[Egypt]] hosted by Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]]. Besides Hussein, those who attened included such dignitaries as Turkish President [[Suleiman Demirel]], Israeli Prime Minister [[Shimon Peres]], US President [[Bill Clinton]],  and Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]]. The summit was convened in order to put the Palestinian-Israeli peace process back on track after a spate of suicide bombings in Israel. In his address to the gathering, Hussein stressed that those who use religious justifications for terrorist acts have tarnished the image of [[Islam]], which is a religion of peace, tolerance and dialogue. Hussein also said that a dual approach must be used in the fight against [[terrorism]]. Sources of funding, training and operations must be cut off, and media coverage must not encourage terrorism. He added that States in the Middle East and throughout the world must eliminate those sources of despair that drive persons to perform such horrible actions, stating:

::''“We must shoulder our responsibilities and work together to protect the [[dignity]] of human beings, whoever and wherever they may be.”''

==Hebron Agreement==
{{main|Hebron Agreement}}
While refusing to negotiate on behalf of either the [[Palestinians]] or the [[Israelis]], Hussein would offer ideas to bridge the gaps between the two parties. For instance, his 11th-hour intervention in January 1997 brought Palestinian President [[Yasser Arafat]] and Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] to an agreement on the long-awaited withdrawal of Israeli troops from most of the [[West Bank]] town of [[Hebron]].

==The Wye accords==
{{Main|Wye River Memorandum}}
In 1997 when U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] needed some prestigious heft to break the deadlock at the [[Wye River Memorandum|Wye Plantation talks]], he invited Hussein, who was in the US undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer, to attend. Hussein received a standing ovation at the ceremony and praise from Clinton who said: 

::''“The Jordanian Monarch was at the heart of the diplomatic breakthrough. His [[courage]], [[commitment]], [[wisdom]] and, frankly, stern instruction at certain times, were at the heart of this success. Every time he was in the room, he made us all become a little closer to the people we all would like to see ourselves as being.”''

Though the agreement hashed out at Wye followed the usual, complex course of mid-eastern affairs, Hussein’s input at the conference helped to sway the participants to at least begin to agree.

==Illness==
At the end of July 1998 Hussein made public a letter to his brother, Crown Prince Hassan, divulging that his doctors at the [[Mayo Clinic]] thought he had lymphatic cancer. By the beginning of August they had confirmed it. Hussein's lymphoma was of a type that responded to chemotherapy, which the King had already begun and his physicians were optimistic he could be cured. Speaking on Jordanian television via satellite, Hussein told his people, "Rest assured, I am not over and done with." Nevertheless, he looked fragile and pale. It was the 62-year-old monarch's second bout with cancer; he lost a kidney to the disease in 1992.

On his way back to Jordan in January 1999, Hussein stopped in [[London]]. Doctors advised him to rest and stay in England for a few weeks, as he was still too fragile to travel. The King declined. According to sources present, he stated that, 

::''“I need very much to feel the warmth of my people around me, there is work to be done and I will get the strength from my people to finish the business.“''<ref>Mideastnews.com; 8 February 1999</ref>

Piloting his own aircraft as he did hundreds of times, he touched down in Amman, prayed on the tarmac and insisted, again against doctors{{Who|date=August 2009}} advice, on riding in an open white limousine. It was a long journey in the pouring rain, and the king stood bravely greeting an estimated 2 million of his 4.6 million subjects who braved the elements and came out to greet their beloved monarch.

==Death==

Just before his death, Hussein made a constitutionally allowable change to his will, disinheriting the heir-apparent of several decades, his brother [[Prince Hassan bin Talal|Hassan]], in favor of his eldest son [[Abdullah II of Jordan|Abdullah]]. Then, with a recurrent fever, he abruptly returned to the U.S. clinic on 25 January 1999 for further treatment. He underwent a [[bone marrow transplant]] earlier that week, but the transplant failed, and the king returned home to die. 

On [[February 7]], [[1999]] King Hussein died of complications related to [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]. He was, at the time of his death, one of the longest-serving leaders in international politics.<ref name="CNN1" /> He had been the King of Jordan for over 46 years and in that time was plagued by a single problem that overshadowed every other in his political life: Peace in the Middle East. Sadly, he did not live to see its resolution even though he is remembered as one whose efforts helped his neighbors, the Israelis and the Palestinians, to live in the peace that eluded him most of his life. In an interview with [[CNN]]'s [[Christiane Amanpour]] in January 1999, Hussein stated:

::''“I still feel that those of us who work for [[peace]] and believe in peace have a very, very loud voice, and hopefully, wisdom and [[common sense]] will prevail.“''<ref>[[CNN]]/[[Time]] “Newsstand” Interviewer: [[Christiane Amanpour]]. January 24, 1999</ref>

On [[February 8]] the flag-draped coffin carrying the body of the King left his home which he called the "Door of Peace" Palace after the peace he forged with Israel. All five of his sons were in close attendance and an honor guard of Bedouin troops accompanied the casket of the monarch on a 90-minute procession through the streets of the capital city of Amman. An estimated 800,000 Jordanians, many of them weeping, braved icy winds to say farewell to their leader.<ref>PBS NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, 1999 Online NewsHour</ref> The funeral was attended by many dignitaries and statesmen from around the world.<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/dagtho/rg-jordankhussein1999.html Geocities.com]</ref> That same day the [[UN General Assembly]] held an Emergency Special Session in "Tribute to the Memory of His Majesty the King of Jordan".<ref>[http://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/eed216406b50bf6485256ce10072f637/50fcab40648861c0852569430054859e?OpenDocument U.N.
