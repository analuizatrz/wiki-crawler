'''U.S. Route 30''' ('''US&nbsp;30''') is a part of the [[United States Numbered Highway System]] that runs from[[Astoria, Oregon]], to the [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. In Indiana, it is a [[Indiana State Road|State Road]] that enters the state between [[Lynwood, Illinois]], and [[Dyer, Indiana|Dyer]]. The {{convert| 155.96 |mi|km|2}} of US&nbsp;30 that lie within Indiana serve as a major conduit. All of the highway is listed on the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]]. Various sections are rural four-lane highway and urbanized four-lane divided expressway.  US&nbsp;30 passes through farm fields and urban areas, and along the northern half of the state.

US&nbsp;30 was first designated as a US Highway in 1926. A section of the highway originally served as part of the Lincoln Highway. US&nbsp;30 replaced the original State Road 2 (SR&nbsp;2) and SR&nbsp;44 designation of the highway which dated back to the formation of the Indiana State Road system. SR&nbsp;2 ran from Illinois state line through [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] to [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] and ended at the Ohio state line.  SR&nbsp;44 ran from [[Valparaiso, Indiana| Valparaiso]] to [[Plymouth, Indiana|Plymouth]] to Fort Wayne. Realignments and construction projects have expanded the highway to four lanes across the state.

== Route description ==
US&nbsp;30 enters [[Dyer, Indiana|Dyer]] from [[Lynwood, Illinois]] along the original alignment of the [[Lincoln Highway in Indiana|Lincoln Highway]].  The highway is four-lane divided highway, passing through mostly commercial properties.  At Moeller Street in Dyer the the roadway becomes a four-lane highway with a center turn lane.  The route has an at grade crossing with the [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] Railroad tracks.  The road becomes a four-lane divided highway before a [[traffic light]] at [[U.S. Route 41 in Indiana|US&nbsp;41]] in [[Schererville, Indiana|Schererville]].  After US&nbsp;41 the highway passes under the [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]] Railroad tracks.  After US&nbsp;41 the original alignment of the Lincoln Highway leaves US&nbsp;30 and travel on old [[Indiana State Road 330|State Road 330]] (SR&nbsp;330).  US&nbsp;30 begins to curve towards the southeast, still as a four-lane divided highway.  The highway has a traffic light at [[Indiana State Road 55|SR&nbsp;55]], heading east again, as the roadway enters [[Merrillville, Indiana|Merrillville]].  The route becomes a six-lane divided highway and has an interchange at [[Interstate 65 in Indiana|Interstate 65]] (I–65).  At Colorado Street in Merrillville the road narrows back to a four-lane divided highway.<ref name="Google Maps" /><ref name="INDOT 2012 Map" /><ref name="INDOT Railroad map" />

The road has a traffic light at the southern terminus of [[Indiana State Road 51|SR&nbsp;51]] in [[Hobart, Indiana|Hobart]] and US&nbsp;30 enters rural areas of Indiana.

The roadway enter Valparaiso passing through commercial properties and a series of curves.  The highway a a traffic light at the western end of the [[Indiana State Road 2|SR&nbsp;2]] concurrency.  The two highways pass of the Chicago, Fort Wayne, and Eastern Railroad tracks and the Norfolk Southern railroad tracks.  the concurrency passes south of the [[Valparaiso University]] and as a traffic light at the eastern terminus of [[Indiana State Road 130|SR&nbsp;130]].  After passing the traffic light at SR&nbsp;130, the road has a full interchange with [[Indiana State Road 49|SR&nbsp;49]] and the eastern terminus of [[Indiana State Road 2|SR&nbsp;2]] concurrency.  After the interchange at SR&nbsp;49, the road passes the [[Porter County Municipal Airport]].  The highway heads east-southeast from Valparaiso, towards [[Plymouth, Indiana|Plymouth]] passing through rural farmland, with an intersection at [[U.S. Route 421 in Indiana|US&nbsp;421]] and an at grade railroad crossing with the [[Chesapeake and Indiana Railroad]].  East of the railroad tracks is an intersection with [[Indiana State Road 39|SR&nbsp;39]] and an interchange at [[U.S. Route 35 in Indiana|US&nbsp;35]].<ref name="Google Maps" /><ref name="INDOT 2012 Map" /><ref name="INDOT Railroad map" />

The highway heads along the northside of Plymouth passing through an interchange with the northern terminus [[Indiana State Road 17|SR&nbsp;17]] and near the [[Plymouth Municipal Airport (Indiana)|Plymouth Municipal Municipal Airport]].

The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state highways as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called [[average annual daily traffic]] (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2010, INDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were 10,870&nbsp;vehicles and 4,750 commercial vehicles used the highway daily between US&nbsp;31 and SR&nbsp;331. The peak traffic volumes were 69,280&nbsp;vehicles and 12,660 commercial vehicles AADT along the section of US&nbsp;30 at is concurrent with I–69, between the Lima Road and Coldwater Road exits in Fort Wayne.<ref name="AADT">{{cite web |url=http://dotmaps.indot.in.gov/apps/trafficcounts/|title= INDOT Traffic Zones|publisher=Indiana Department of Transportation |date=2010 |accessdate=August 20, 2012}}</ref>
