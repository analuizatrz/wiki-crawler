'''Hussein bin Talal, King of Jordan''' ({{lang-ar|حسين بن طلال}}, ''{{unicode|Ḥusayn bin Ṭalāl}}'') ([[Amman]], [[November 14]], [[1935]] – [[Amman]], [[February 7]], [[1999]]) was the ruler of [[Jordan]] from the abdication of his father, [[King Talal]], in 1952, until his death. Hussein guided his country in the context of the [[Cold War]], and through four decades of [[Arab-Israeli conflict]], balancing the pressures of [[Arab nationalism]], the burdens of sheltering a large [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] refugee population, and the allure of Western-style development against the stark reality of Jordan's geographic location.<ref name="CNN1">{{cite news|title=King Hussein is dead|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9902/07/king.hussein.obit/|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=[[1999-02-07]]}}</ref>

Hussein's family claims a line of descent from the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]. "We are the family of the prophet and we are the oldest tribe in the Arab world", the king once said of his [[Hashemite]] ancestry.<ref name="CNN1" />

==Early life and accession==
Hussein was educated at [[Victoria College, Alexandria|Victoria College]] in [[Alexandria]]. He proceeded to [[Harrow School]] in [[England]], where he befriended his cousin [[Faisal II of Iraq]]. He pursued further study at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]].

[[Image:Young.king.jpg|left|200px|thumb|In 1952, Hussein bin Talal was named King of Jordan]]

On July 20, 1951, Prince Hussein traveled to [[Jerusalem]] to perform [[Friday prayers]] with his grandfather, [[Abdullah I of Jordan|King Abdullah I]]. A Palestinian extremist, fearing the king might negotiate a peace with the newly-created state of Israel, opened fire on Abdullah and his grandson. Abdullah was killed, but the 15-year-old Hussein survived, and turned to pursue the gunman. The assailant turned his weapon on the young prince, who was saved when the bullet was deflected by a medal on his uniform given to him by his grandfather.<ref name="CNN1" />

He was appointed Crown Prince of Jordan on [[September 9]], [[1951]]. Abdullah's eldest son, [[King Talal]], was crowned [[King of Jordan]], but within a year was forced to abdicate owing to his mental state (European and Arab doctors diagnosed schizophrenia).<ref>[http://www.royalty.nu/MiddleEast/Jordan/Hussein.html Royalty.nu - Royalty in Jordan - The Life of King Hussein<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> King Talal's son, Crown Prince Hussein, was proclaimed King of the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]] on [[August 11]], [[1952]], succeeding at the age of 16; because this was under the legal age, he was enthroned a year later, on May 2, 1953.<ref name="CNN1" />

==Six-Day War==
{{mainarticle|Six-Day War}}
In mid-1967, Jordan joined Egypt and Syria to fight Israel in the Six Day War. Jordan lost control of the [[West Bank]] and east Jerusalem and saw its military shattered, but Hussein shored up his support among the country's growing Palestinian population.<ref name="CNN2">[http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9902/07/king.hussein.obit/chrono/chrono.html CNN - Highlights of King Hussein's life]</ref>

==Black September==
{{mainarticle|Black September in Jordan|l1=Black September}}
In September 1970, the king ordered the forcible expulsion of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], which he considered to be attempting to foment a civil war, from the country.

==The Gulf War==
{{mainarticle|Gulf War}}

The country also defied the West and the other allied leaders by refusing to side against [[Saddam Hussein]] in the [[Gulf War]] &mdash; allegedly done for internal political reasons after the [[Ma'an uprising]] in 1988 that threatened the throne of the King &mdash; which alienated the kingdom from most of the [[Arab world]].

==Peace with Israel==
{{mainarticle|Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace}}
In 1994 King Hussein concluded negotiations to end the official state of war with [[Israel]] resulting in the [[Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace]] which he had begun negotiating in secret with the Israelis in the 1970s.

King Hussein developed strong ties of friendship with Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]], with whom he had negotiated the peace treaty. King Hussein gave a powerful speech at the funeral of Yitzhak Rabin:

:''Full text: [[wikisource:Hussein of Jordan's Speech at Rabin's Funeral]]''

::''My sister, Mrs. Leah Rabin, my friends, I had never thought that the moment would come like this when I would grieve the loss of a brother, a colleague and a friend - a man, a soldier who met us on the opposite side of a divide whom we respected as he respected us. A man I came to know because I realized, as he did, that we have to cross over the divide, establish a dialogue, get to know each other and strive to leave for those who follow us a legacy that is worthy of them. And so we did. And so we became brethren and friends.''<ref>[http://www.danielpipes.org/article/4255 Transcript from CNN life coverage by Daniel Pipes]</ref>

==Books==
The king wrote three books: ''Uneasy Lies the Head'' (1962), about his childhood and early years as king; ''My War With Israel'' (1969); and ''Mon Métier de Roi''.

==Death==
He died of complications related to [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] on [[February 7]], [[1999]]. The King had been suffering from the disease for many years and had been treated at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota]], [[United States]] on a fairly regular basis. 

Just before his death, he made a constitutionally-allowable change to his will, disinheriting the heir-apparent of several decades, his brother [[Prince Hassan bin Talal|Hassan]], in favor of his eldest son [[Abdullah II of Jordan|Abdullah]]. Then, with a recurrent fever, he abruptly returned to the U.S. clinic January 25 for further treatment. He underwent a [[bone marrow transplant]] earlier that week, but the transplant failed, and the king returned home to die. The King was, at the time of his death, one of the longest-serving leaders in international politics.<ref name="CNN1" />
