<p><b>Rodrigo Lopez</b>, whose original name is thought to have been Rodrigo <b>Lopes</b>, (c. 1525 – 7 June 1594) was a <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_people" title="Portuguese people">Portuguese</a> physician, who served <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England" title="Elizabeth I of England">Queen Elizabeth</a>, and may have been an inspiration for Shakespeare&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Shylock" title="Shylock">Shylock</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Merchant_of_Venice" title="The Merchant of Venice">The Merchant of Venice</a></i>.</p>

<p>He was born in <a href="/wiki/Crato%2C_Portugal" title="Crato, Portugal">Crato, Portugal</a> and raised as a <a href="/wiki/New_Christian" title="New Christian">New Christian</a>.  He was driven away from <a href="/wiki/Portugal" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_Inquisition" title="Portuguese Inquisition">Portuguese Inquisition</a> and was known to be a <a href="/wiki/Marrano" title="Marrano">Marrano</a> (a hidden <a href="/wiki/Jew" title="Jew">Jew</a>).</p>
<p>He made London his home in 1559 and successfully resumed his practice as a doctor, soon becoming house physician at <a href="/wiki/St._Bartholomew&#39;s_Hospital" title="St. Bartholomew&#39;s Hospital">St. Bartholomew&#39;s Hospital</a>. He developed a large practice among powerful people, including <a href="/wiki/Robert_Dudley%2C_1st_Earl_of_Leicester" title="Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester">Robert Dudley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Francis_Walsingham" title="Francis Walsingham">Francis Walsingham</a>. A 1584 libelous pamphlet attacking Dudley suggested that Lopez distilled poisons for Dudley and other noblemen as well. In 1586, Lopez reached the pinnacle of his profession; he was made <a href="/wiki/Physician-in-chief" title="physician-in-chief">physician-in-chief</a> to Queen Elizabeth.  Lopez earned the queen&#39;s favour: for in 1589 she granted him a monopoly on the importation of <a href="/wiki/Aniseed" title="aniseed">aniseed</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sumac" title="sumac">sumac</a>. His success continued as he neared retirement. He was viewed, at least outwardly, as being a dutiful practicing <a href="/wiki/Protestant" title="Protestant">Protestant</a>.</p>
<p>In October 1593, Lopez was wealthy and generally respected. At that time, he owned a house in <a href="/wiki/Holborn" title="Holborn">Holborn</a> and had a son enrolled at <a href="/wiki/Winchester_College" title="Winchester College">Winchester College</a>. However, also in October, a complex web of conspiracy against <a href="/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio%2C_Prior_of_Crato" title="António, Prior of Crato">Dom António, Prior of Crato</a> began to come to light. Subsequently, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Devereux%2C_2nd_Earl_of_Essex" title="Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex">Robert Devereux</a> accused Lopez of conspiring with Spanish emissaries to poison the Queen. Lopez was arrested on 1 January 1594, convicted in February, and subsequently <a href="/wiki/Hanged%2C_drawn_and_quartered" title="hanged, drawn and quartered">hanged, drawn and quartered</a> on 7 June. His trial at London&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Guildhall" title="Guildhall">Guildhall</a> was referred to by <a href="/wiki/Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales" title="Charles, Prince of Wales">Charles, Prince of Wales</a> in his Guildhall address to the <a href="/wiki/Board_of_Deputies_of_British_Jews" title="Board of Deputies of British Jews">Board of Deputies of British Jews</a> on 5 July 2011.</p>
<p>The Queen herself was uncertain of his guilt and delayed his execution.  Lopez maintained his innocence and his true conversion from Judaism to Christianity.  According to the 16th-century historian <a href="/wiki/William_Camden" title="William Camden">William Camden</a>, just before Lopez was hanged, he said to the crowd that he loved his queen as well as he loved <a href="/wiki/Jesus_Christ" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a>. The crowd laughed at this statement, taking it for a thinly veiled confession.</p>
<p>Some historians and literary critics consider Lopez and his trial to have been an influence on <a href="/wiki/William_Shakespeare" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Merchant_of_Venice" title="The Merchant of Venice">The Merchant of Venice</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> &#34;Many Shakespearean scholars believe Dr. Lopez was the prototype for Shylock,&#34;<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> which is believed to have been written between 1596 and 1598. There is also a mention of Lopez in the posthumously published text of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Tragical_History_of_Doctor_Faustus" title="The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus">The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus</a></i>, comparing him to the titular hero: &#34;Doctor Lopus was never such a doctor!&#34; This reference was presumably added after Marlowe&#39;s death in 1593.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
