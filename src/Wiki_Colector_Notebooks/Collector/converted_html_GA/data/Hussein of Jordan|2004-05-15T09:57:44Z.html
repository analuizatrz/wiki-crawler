<p><b>Hussein bin Talal</b> (<a href="/wiki/November_14" title="November 14">November 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/1935" title="1935">1935</a> - <a href="/wiki/February_7" title="February 7">February 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/1999" title="1999">1999</a>) was the <a href="/wiki/King_of_Jordan" title="King of Jordan">King of Jordan</a> (<a href="/wiki/1952" title="1952">1952</a>-<a href="/wiki/1999" title="1999">1999</a>) and an <a href="/wiki/Amateur_radio" title="amateur radio">amateur radio</a> operator (call sign JY1). </p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/July_20" title="July 20">July 20</a>, <a href="/wiki/1951" title="1951">1951</a>, <a href="/wiki/King_Abdullah_I" title="King Abdullah I">King Abdullah I</a> traveled to <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> to perform his Friday prayers with his young grandson, Prince Hussein. He was assassinated by a gunman at the instigation of Col. Abdullah Tell, ex-Military Governor of Jerusalem, and Dr. Musa Abdullah Husseini, on the steps of one of the holiest shrines of Islam, the <a href="/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Mosque" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a>. Hussein grappled with the assailant, until he was wounded himself; he is said to have been saved from a bullet by a medal his grandfather had recently awarded him and insisted he wear.</p>
<p>Abdullah&#39;s eldest son, <a href="/wiki/King_Talal" title="King Talal">King Talal</a> was crowned, but within a year was forced to resign because of a mental illness. His son Prince Hussein was proclaimed King of the <a href="/wiki/Hashemite_Kingdom_of_Jordan" title="Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan">Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_11" title="August 11">August 11</a>, <a href="/wiki/1952" title="1952">1952</a> and was enthroned <a href="/wiki/May_2" title="May 2">May 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/1953" title="1953">1953</a>.</p>
<p>Hussein survived numerous <a href="/wiki/Assassin" title="assassin">assassination</a> attempts, but on <a href="/wiki/February_7" title="February 7">February 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/1999" title="1999">1999</a>, he lost his long fight with <a href="/wiki/Cancer" title="cancer">cancer</a>.  The King had been suffering from the disease for many years and had visited the <a href="/wiki/Mayo_Clinic" title="Mayo Clinic">Mayo Clinic</a> in <a href="/wiki/Rochester%2C_Minnesota" title="Rochester, Minnesota">Rochester, Minnesota</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> on a fairly regular basis for treatment.  Just before his death, he changed his will and declared his son, instead of his brother, to be his successor.  The King was at the time of his death the longest serving leader in international politics and the most respected.  This showed at his funeral, which, along with the funerals of <a href="/wiki/Tito" title="Tito">Tito</a> and <a href="/wiki/Charles_De_Gaulle" title="Charles De Gaulle">Charles De Gaulle</a>, will probably go down in history as being one of the most widely attended.</p>
<p>In a show of unusual political diversity, leaders of radical <a href="/wiki/Arab" title="Arab">Arab</a> states were side by side with officials from western democracies. <a href="/wiki/United_States_President" title="United States President">President</a> <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" title="Bill Clinton">Clinton</a> and former Presidents <a href="/wiki/George_H._W._Bush" title="George H. W. Bush">Bush</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Carter" title="Jimmy Carter">Carter</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gerald_Ford" title="Gerald Ford">Ford</a> represented the United States, a longtime ally of Jordan&#39;s. Their presence reflected Hussein&#39;s long and usually warm relationship with the United States going back to the <a href="/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower" title="Dwight D. Eisenhower">Eisenhower</a> era. Visitors paid their respects in the throne room of the king&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Hashemite" title="Hashemite">Hashemite</a> Dynasty.</p>
<p>Britain sent Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Tony_Blair" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> and <a href="/wiki/Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales" title="Charles, Prince of Wales">Charles, Prince of Wales</a>. French President <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Chirac" title="Jacques Chirac">Jacques Chirac</a> and German Chancellor <a href="/wiki/Gerhard_Schroeder" title="Gerhard Schroeder">Gerhard Schroeder</a> also came. The funeral brought bitter enemies together, including both sides of the Middle East wars. <a href="/wiki/Syria" title="Syria">Syrian</a> President and <a href="/wiki/Hafez_Al-Assad" title="Hafez Al-Assad">Hafez Al-Assad</a> and <a href="/wiki/Palestinian" title="Palestinian">Palestinian</a> leader <a href="/wiki/Yasser_Arafat" title="Yasser Arafat">Yasser Arafat</a> attended alongside their lontime rival Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, who himself was once Hussein&#39;s foe but came to <a href="/wiki/Amman" title="Amman">Amman</a> to mourn the loss of his recent partner in peace. Neighboring <a href="/wiki/Iraq" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> was represented by its vice president. <a href="/wiki/Libya" title="Libya">Libyan</a> Leader <a href="/wiki/Moammar_Qadaffi" title="Moammar Qadaffi">Moammar Qadaffi</a> sent his eldest son. <a href="/wiki/Czech_Republic" title="Czech Republic">Czech</a> president <a href="/wiki/Vaclav_Havel" title="Vaclav Havel">Vaclav Havel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russian</a> president <a href="/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin" title="Boris Yeltsin">Boris Yeltsin</a>, themselves both seriously ill, also came—Yeltsin against the advice of his doctors. According to Jordanian officials, Yeltsin returned home earlier than expected for medical reasons.</p>
<p>On the human level, the numbers speak for King Hussein&#39;s achievements. While in <a href="/wiki/1950" title="1950">1950</a>, <a href="/wiki/Water" title="water">water</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sanitation" title="sanitation">sanitation</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Electricity" title="electricity">electricity</a> were available to only 10% of Jordanians, today these reach 99% of the population. In <a href="/wiki/1960" title="1960">1960</a> only 33% of Jordanians were <a href="/wiki/Literacy" title="literacy">literate</a>, in <a href="/wiki/1996" title="1996">1996</a>, this number climbed to 85.5%. In <a href="/wiki/1961" title="1961">1961</a>, the average Jordanian received a daily intake of 2198 <a href="/wiki/Calorie" title="calorie">calories</a>, and by <a href="/wiki/1992" title="1992">1992</a>, this figure had increased by 37.5% to reach 3022 calories. <a href="/wiki/UNICEF" title="UNICEF">UNICEF</a> statistics show that between <a href="/wiki/1981" title="1981">1981</a> and <a href="/wiki/1991" title="1991">1991</a>, Jordan achieved the world&#39;s fastest annual rate of decline in <a href="/wiki/Infant_mortality" title="infant mortality">infant mortality</a>—from 70 deaths per 1000 births in 1981 to 37 per 1000 in 1991, a fall of over 47%. King Hussein always believed that Jordan&#39;s people are its biggest asset, and he continued to encourage all—including the less fortunate, the <a href="/wiki/Disability" title="disability">disabled</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Orphan" title="orphan">orphaned</a>—to achieve more for themselves and their country.</p>
<p>King Hussein&#39;s commitment to <a href="/wiki/Democracy" title="democracy">democracy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Civil_liberty" title="civil liberty">civil liberties</a> and <a href="/wiki/Human_rights" title="human rights">human rights</a> has helped pave the way in making Jordan a model state for the region. The kingdom is internationally recognized as having the most exemplary human rights record in the Middle East, while recent reforms have allowed Jordan to resume its irreversible drive to democratization. In <a href="/wiki/1990" title="1990">1990</a>, King Hussein appointed a royal commission representing the entire spectrum of Jordanian political thought to draft a national charter. Today the National Charter, along with the Jordanian Constitution, serves as a guideline for democratic institutionalization and political <a href="/wiki/Pluralism" title="pluralism">pluralism</a> in the country. In <a href="/wiki/1989" title="1989">1989</a>, <a href="/wiki/1993" title="1993">1993</a> and <a href="/wiki/1997" title="1997">1997</a>, Jordan held <a href="/wiki/Parliament" title="parliament">parliamentary</a> <a href="/wiki/Election" title="election">elections</a> which were accredited internationally as among the freest and fairest ever held in the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>.</p>
<p>Hussein was an accomplished <a href="/wiki/Aviation" title="aviation">aviator</a>, <a href="/wiki/Motorcycle" title="motorcycle">motorcyclist</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Auto_racing" title="auto racing">race-car driver</a>. He enjoyed <a href="/wiki/List_of_water_sports" title="list of water sports">water sports</a>, <a href="/wiki/Skiing" title="skiing">skiing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tennis" title="tennis">tennis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Amateur_radio" title="amateur radio">amateur radio</a>, and surfing the <a href="/wiki/Internet" title="Internet">Internet</a>. King Hussein read extensively on <a href="/wiki/Politics" title="politics">political affairs</a>, <a href="/wiki/History" title="history">history</a>, <a href="/wiki/International_law" title="international law">international law</a>, <a href="/wiki/Military_science" title="military science">military science</a>, and aviation. In addition to being an avid reader, the King was the subject of numerous books and wrote three of his own: <i>Uneasy Lies the Head</i> (<a href="/wiki/1962" title="1962">1962</a>), about his childhood and early years as king, <i>My War With Israel</i> (<a href="/wiki/1969" title="1969">1969</a>), and <i>Mon Métier de Roi</i>.</p>

<p>He was married four times, probably a record for any Head of State of his time. His four wives were:</p>
