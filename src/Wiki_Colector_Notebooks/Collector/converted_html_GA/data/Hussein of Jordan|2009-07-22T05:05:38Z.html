<p>Hussein was born in Amman on November 14th, 1935, to then Prince Talal bin Abdullah and <a href="/wiki/Zein_al_Sharaf_Talal" title="Zein al Sharaf Talal">Princess Zein al-Sharaf bint Jamil</a>. After completing his elementary education in Amman, he was educated at <a href="/wiki/Victoria_College%2C_Alexandria" title="Victoria College, Alexandria">Victoria College</a> in <a href="/wiki/Alexandria" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. He proceeded to <a href="/wiki/Harrow_School" title="Harrow School">Harrow School</a> in <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>, where he befriended his cousin <a href="/wiki/Faisal_II_of_Iraq" title="Faisal II of Iraq">Faisal II of Iraq</a>.

<p>On July 20, 1951, Prince Hussein traveled to <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> to perform <a href="/wiki/Friday_prayers" title="Friday prayers">Friday prayers</a> at the  <a href="/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Mosque" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> with his grandfather, <a href="/wiki/Abdullah_I_of_Jordan" title="Abdullah I of Jordan">King Abdullah I</a>. A Palestinian extremist, fearing the king might negotiate a peace with the newly-created state of Israel, opened fire on Abdullah and his grandson. Abdullah was killed, but the 15-year-old Hussein survived, and turned to pursue the gunman. The assailant turned his weapon on the young prince, who was saved when the bullet was deflected by a medal on his uniform given to him by his grandfather.<sup id="_ref-CNN1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CNN1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In his autobiography, <i>Uneasy Lies the Head</i>, Hussein recalls how three days before that fateful day in Jerusalem, his grandfather turned to him and said:</p><blockquote><i>&#34;I hope you realize, my son, that one day you will have to assume responsibility. I look to you to do your very best to see that my work is not lost. I look to you to continue it in the service of our people.”</i><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>He was appointed Crown Prince of Jordan on <a href="/wiki/September_9" title="September 9">September 9</a>, <a href="/wiki/1951" title="1951">1951</a>. Abdullah&#39;s eldest son, <a href="/wiki/King_Talal" title="King Talal">King Talal</a>, was crowned <a href="/wiki/King_of_Jordan" title="King of Jordan">King of Jordan</a>, but within a year was forced to abdicate owing to his mental state (European and Arab doctors diagnosed schizophrenia).<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> King Talal&#39;s son, Crown Prince Hussein, was proclaimed King of the <a href="/wiki/Hashemite_Kingdom_of_Jordan" title="Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan">Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_11" title="August 11">August 11</a>, <a href="/wiki/1952" title="1952">1952</a>, succeeding at the age of 16; because this was under the legal age, he was enthroned a year later, on May 2, 1953.<sup id="_ref-CNN1_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CNN1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Reign">Reign</span></h1>

<p>In March 1956 Hussein established his firm authority over Jordan, and burnished his own nationalist credentials by dismissing <a href="/wiki/John_Bagot_Glubb" title="John Bagot Glubb">Glubb “Pasha”</a> as the commander of the Jordanian Army, and replacing all the British officers with Jordanians. This now mainly <a href="/wiki/Bedouin" title="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> army was fiercely loyal to him, not just because the monarchy and the <a href="/wiki/East_Bank" title="East Bank">East Bank</a> Bedouin tribes depended upon each other but also because, in personal style, Hussein was a classic Bedouin leader.</p>
<p>He navigated Jordan through turbulent years and maintained Jordan&#39;s reputation as an oasis of stability. After the <a href="/wiki/Six_Day_War" title="Six Day War">Six Day War</a>, King Hussein opened Jordan&#39;s borders and welcomed well over a million <a href="/wiki/Palestinian" title="Palestinian">Palestinian</a> refugees and almost instantly gave them Jordanian citizenship giving them free access to healthcare and an education. He heavily invested in human capital in his 40+ years as King.  As a result, Jordan had the most advanced health and education systems in the Arab World. The King Hussein Medical City became the regional hub for treatement and surgery. </p>
<p>In 1991, together with an executive royal council, Hussein created the National Charter which reaffirmed democratic principles and lifted martial law. Opposition movements and political parties were legalized and freedom of the press was reaffirmed.</p>

In mid-1967, Jordan joined Egypt and Syria to fight Israel in the Six Day War. Jordan lost control of the <a href="/wiki/West_Bank" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> and east Jerusalem and saw its military shattered, but Hussein shored up his support among the country&#39;s growing Palestinian population.<sup id="_ref-CNN2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CNN2" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

King Hussein developed strong ties of friendship with Israeli Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Yitzhak_Rabin" title="Yitzhak Rabin">Yitzhak Rabin</a>, with whom he had negotiated the peace treaty. King Hussein gave a powerful speech at the funeral of Yitzhak Rabin:</p>

<dd><i>&#34;My sister, Mrs. Leah Rabin, my friends, I had never thought that the moment would come like this when I would grieve the loss of a brother, a colleague and a friend — a man, a soldier who met us on the opposite side of a divide whom we respected as he respected us. A man I came to know because I realized, as he did, that we have to cross over the divide, establish a dialogue, get to know each other and strive to leave for those who follow us a legacy that is worthy of them. And so we did. And so we became brethren and friends ... And as I stand here, I am obliged to you, to my people in Jordan and to the world, to keep on doing the utmost to guarantee that we leave behind a similar inheritance.&#34;<b><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></b></i></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Wye_accords">The Wye accords</span></h1>
<p>{{mainarticle}}
In 1997 when <a href="/wiki/President_Bill_Clinton" title="President Bill Clinton">President Bill Clinton</a> needed some prestigious heft to break the deadlock at the <a href="/wiki/Wye_River_Memorandum" title="Wye River Memorandum">Wye Plantation talks</a>, he invited Hussein, who was in the US undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer, to attend. Hussein received a standing ovation at the ceremony and praise from Clinton who said: </p><blockquote><i>“The Jordanian Monarch was at the heart of the diplomatic breakthrough. His courage, commitment, wisdom and, frankly, stern instruction at certain times, were at the heart of this success. Every time he was in the room, he made us all become a little closer to the people we all would like to see ourselves as being.”</i></blockquote>

<p>Though the agreement hashed out at Wye followed the usual, complex course of mid-eastern affairs, Hussein’s input at the conference helped to sway the participants to at least begin to agree.</p>
<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Illness">Illness</span></h1>
<p>At the end of July 1998 Hussein made public a letter to his brother, Crown Prince Hassan, divulging that his doctors at the <a href="/wiki/Mayo_Clinic" title="Mayo Clinic">Mayo Clinic</a> thought he had lymphatic cancer. By the beginning of August they had confirmed it. Hussein&#39;s lymphoma was of a type that responded to chemotherapy, which the King had already begun and his physicians were optimistic he could be cured. Speaking on Jordanian television via satellite, Hussein told his people, &#34;Rest assured, I am not over and done with.&#34; Nevertheless, he looked fragile and pale. It was the 62-year-old monarch&#39;s second bout with cancer; he lost a kidney to the disease in 1992.</p>
<p>On his way back to Jordan in January 1999, Hussein stopped in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>. Doctors advised him to rest and stay in England for a few weeks, as he was still too fragile to travel. The King declined. According to sources present, he stated that, </p><blockquote><i>&#34;I need very much to feel the warmth of my people around me, there is work to be done and I will get the strength from my people to finish the business.&#34;</i><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></blockquote>  

<p>Piloting his own aircraft as he did hundreds of times, he touched down in Amman, prayed on the tarmac and insisted, again against doctors advice, on riding in an open white limousine. It was a long journey in the pouring rain, and the king stood bravely greeting an estimated 2 million of his 4.6 million subjects who braved the elements and came out to greet their beloved monarch.</p>
<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Death">Death</span></h1>

<p>Just before his death, Hussein made a constitutionally-allowable change to his will, disinheriting the heir-apparent of several decades, his brother <a href="/wiki/Prince_Hassan_bin_Talal" title="Prince Hassan bin Talal">Hassan</a>, in favor of his eldest son <a href="/wiki/Abdullah_II_of_Jordan" title="Abdullah II of Jordan">Abdullah</a>. Then, with a recurrent fever, he abruptly returned to the U.S. clinic on 25 January 1999 for further treatment. He underwent a <a href="/wiki/Bone_marrow_transplant" title="bone marrow transplant">bone marrow transplant</a> earlier that week, but the transplant failed, and the king returned home to die. </p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/February_7" title="February 7">February 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/1999" title="1999">1999</a> King Hussein died of complications related to <a href="/wiki/Non-Hodgkin&#39;s_lymphoma" title="non-Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma">non-Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma</a>. He was, at the time of his death, one of the longest-serving leaders in international politics.<sup id="_ref-CNN1_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CNN1" title="">[1]</a></sup> He had been the King of Jordan for over 46 years and in that time was plagued by a single problem that overshadowed every other in his political life: Peace in the Middle East. Sadly, he did not live to see its resolution even though he is remembered as one whose efforts helped his neighbors, the Israelis and the Palestinians, to live in the peace that eluded him most of his life. In an interview with <a href="/wiki/CNN" title="CNN">CNN</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Christiane_Amanpour" title="Christiane Amanpour">Christiane Amanpour</a> in January 1999, Hussein stated:</p><blockquote><i>&#34;I still feel that those of us who work for peace and believe in peace have a very, very loud voice, and hopefully, wisdom and common sense will prevail.&#34;</i><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></blockquote>  

<p>On <a href="/wiki/February_8" title="February 8">February 8</a> the flag-draped coffin carrying the body of the King left his home which he called the &#34;Door of Peace&#34; Palace after the peace he forged with Israel. All five of his sons were in close attendance and an honor guard of Bedouin troops accompanied the casket of the monarch on a 90-minute procession through the streets of the capital city of Amman. An estimated 800,000 Jordanians, many of them weeping, braved icy winds to say farewell to their leader.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> The funeral was attended by many dignitaries and statesmen from around the world.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> That same day the <a href="/wiki/UN_General_Assembly" title="UN General Assembly">UN General Assembly</a> held an Emergency Special Session in &#34;Tribute to the Memory of His Majesty the King of Jordan&#34;.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
