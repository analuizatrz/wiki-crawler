<p><b>Rodrigo Lopez</b>, whose original name was probably <b>Rodrigo Lopes</b> (c. <a href="/wiki/1525" title="1525">1525</a> â€“ <a href="/wiki/June_7" title="June 7">June 7</a> <a href="/wiki/1594" title="1594">1594</a>), was physician to <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England" title="Elizabeth I of England">Queen Elizabeth</a>, and may have been an inspiration for Shakespeare&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Shylock" title="Shylock">Shylock</a> in the <a href="/wiki/The_Merchant_of_Venice" title="The Merchant of Venice">The Merchant of Venice</a>.</p>
<p>He was born in <a href="/wiki/Crato%2C_Portugal" title="Crato, Portugal">Crato, Portugal</a> and raised as a <a href="/wiki/New_Christian" title="New Christian">New Christian</a>, but driven away from Portugal by the <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_Inquisition" title="Portuguese Inquisition">Portuguese Inquisition</a> and considered a <a href="/wiki/Marrano" title="Marrano">Marrano</a>.</p>
<p>He made London his home in 1559 and very successfully resumed his practice as a doctor, soon becoming house physician at <a href="/wiki/St._Bartholomew&#39;s_Hospital" title="St. Bartholomew&#39;s Hospital">St. Bartholomew&#39;s Hospital</a>. Despite racial prejudice and professional jealousy, he developed a large practice among powerful people including <a href="/wiki/Robert_Dudley%2C_1st_Earl_of_Leicester" title="Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester">Robert Dudley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Francis_Walsingham" title="Francis Walsingham">Francis Walsingham</a>. Rumor held that his success was less due to his medical skill and more to his skill at flattery and self-promotion. In a 1584 libelous pamphlet attacking Dudley, it was suggested that Lopez distilled poisons for Dudley and other nobleman as well. In 1586, he reached the pinnacle of his profession; he was made <a href="/wiki/Physician-in-chief" title="physician-in-chief">physician-in-chief</a> to Queen Elizabeth. Lopez was held in the queen&#39;s favor for, in 1589, she granted him a monopoly on the importation of aniseed and sumac into England. His success continued as he neared retirement. He was viewed, at least outwardly, as being a dutiful practicing <a href="/wiki/Protestant" title="Protestant">Protestant</a>.</p>
<p>In October of 1593, he was wealthy and generally respected. At that time, he owned a house in <a href="/wiki/Holborn" title="Holborn">Holborn</a> and had a son enrolled at <a href="/wiki/Winchester_College" title="Winchester College">Winchester College</a>. However, also in October, a complex web of conspiracy against <a href="/wiki/Don_Antonio" title="Don Antonio">Don Antonio</a> began to come to light. Subsequently, Lopez was accused by <a href="/wiki/Robert_Devereux%2C_2nd_Earl_of_Essex" title="Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex">Robert Devereux</a> of conspiring with Spanish emissaries to poison the Queen. He was arrested on January 1, 1594, convicted in February, and subsequently executed (<a href="/wiki/Hanging%2C_drawing_and_quartering" title="Hanging, drawing and quartering">hanged, drawn and quartered</a>) on June 7. The Queen herself was uncertain of his guilt (hence the delay in his execution) and he maintained his innocence of treason and his being converted from Judaism to Christianity until his execution. According to <a href="/wiki/William_Camden" title="William Camden">William Camden</a>, right before he was hanged he said to the crowd that he loved his queen as well as he loved Jesus Christ; the crowd laughed at this statement, taking it for a thinly veiled confession, as in their eyes he was still a Jew. Some historians and literary critics consider Lopez and his trial to have been an influence on <a href="/wiki/William_Shakespeare" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/The_Merchant_of_Venice" title="The Merchant of Venice">The Merchant of Venice</a>, which is believed to have been written between 1594 and 1597.</p>
