<p><b>Hussein bin Talal</b> ({{lang-ar}}, <i>Al-Ḥusayn ibn Ṭalāl</i>; 14 November 1935 – 7 February 1999) reigned as <a href="/wiki/King_of_Jordan" title="King of Jordan">King of Jordan</a> from 11 August 1952 until his death. According to Hussein, he was a <a href="/wiki/Hashemites#Family_tree" title="Hashemites">40th-generation direct descendant</a> of <a href="/wiki/Muhammad" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> as he belonged to the <a href="/wiki/Hashemite" title="Hashemite">Hashemite</a> family which has ruled Jordan since 1921.</p>
<p>Hussein was born in <a href="/wiki/Amman" title="Amman">Amman</a> as the eldest child of <a href="/wiki/Talal_bin_Abdullah" title="Talal bin Abdullah">Talal bin Abdullah</a> and <a href="/wiki/Zein_Al-Sharaf" title="Zein Al-Sharaf">Zein Al-Sharaf</a>. Hussein began his schooling in Amman, continuing his education abroad. After Talal became King of Jordan in 1951, Hussein was named <a href="/wiki/Heir_apparent" title="heir apparent">heir apparent</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_Jordan" title="Parliament of Jordan">Parliament</a> forced Talal to <a href="/wiki/Abdicate" title="abdicate">abdicate</a> a year later due to his illness, and a <a href="/wiki/Regency_council" title="regency council">regency council</a> was appointed until Hussein came of age. He was enthroned at the age of 17 on 2 May 1953. Hussein was married four separate times and fathered eleven children: <a href="/wiki/Princess_Alia_bint_Hussein" title="Princess Alia bint Hussein">Princess Alia</a> from <a href="/wiki/Dina_bint_Abdul-Hamid" title="Dina bint Abdul-Hamid">Dina bint Abdul-Hamid</a>; <a href="/wiki/Abdullah_II_of_Jordan" title="Abdullah II of Jordan">Abdullah II</a>, <a href="/wiki/Prince_Faisal_bin_Hussein" title="Prince Faisal bin Hussein">Prince Faisal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Princess_Aisha_bint_Hussein" title="Princess Aisha bint Hussein">Princess Aisha</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Princess_Zein_bint_Hussein" title="Princess Zein bint Hussein">Princess Zein</a> from <a href="/wiki/Antoinette_Gardiner" title="Antoinette Gardiner">Antoinette Gardiner</a>; <a href="/wiki/Princess_Haya_bint_Hussein" title="Princess Haya bint Hussein">Princess Haya</a> and <a href="/wiki/Prince_Ali_bin_Hussein" title="Prince Ali bin Hussein">Prince Ali</a> from <a href="/wiki/Alia_Touqan" title="Alia Touqan">Alia Touqan</a>; <a href="/wiki/Prince_Hamzah_bin_Hussein" title="Prince Hamzah bin Hussein">Prince Hamzah</a>, <a href="/wiki/Prince_Hashim_bin_Hussein" title="Prince Hashim bin Hussein">Prince Hashim</a>, <a href="/wiki/Princess_Iman_bint_Hussein" title="Princess Iman bint Hussein">Princess Iman</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Princess_Raiyah_bint_Hussein" title="Princess Raiyah bint Hussein">Princess Raiyah</a> from <a href="/wiki/Lisa_Halaby" title="Lisa Halaby">Lisa Halaby</a>.</p>
<p>Hussein, a <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_monarch" title="constitutional monarch">constitutional monarch</a>, started his rule with what was termed a &#34;liberal experiment&#34;, allowing, in <a href="/wiki/Jordanian_general_election%2C_1956" title="Jordanian general election, 1956">1956</a>, the formation of the only <a href="/wiki/Suleiman_Nabulsi&#39;s_cabinet" title="Suleiman Nabulsi&#39;s cabinet">democratically elected</a> government in Jordan&#39;s history. A few months into the experiment, he forced that government to resign, declaring <a href="/wiki/Martial_law" title="martial law">martial law</a> and banning political parties. Jordan fought three wars with <a href="/wiki/Israel" title="Israel">Israel</a> under Hussein, including the 1967 <a href="/wiki/Six-Day_War" title="Six-Day War">Six-Day War</a>, which ended in Jordan&#39;s loss of the <a href="/wiki/West_Bank" title="West Bank">West Bank</a>. In 1970 Hussein expelled Palestinian fighters (<a href="/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen" title="Palestinian fedayeen">fedayeen</a>) from Jordan after they had <a href="/wiki/Dawson&#39;s_Field_hijackings" title="Dawson&#39;s Field hijackings">threatened</a> the country&#39;s security in what became known as <a href="/wiki/Black_September_in_Jordan" title="Black September in Jordan">Black September</a>. The King <a href="/wiki/Jordanian_disengagement_from_the_West_Bank" title="Jordanian disengagement from the West Bank">renounced Jordan&#39;s ties</a> to the West Bank in 1988 after the <a href="/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization" title="Palestine Liberation Organization">Palestine Liberation Organization</a> was recognized internationally as the sole representative of the Palestinians. He lifted martial law and reintroduced <a href="/wiki/Elections_in_Jordan" title="Elections in Jordan">elections</a> in <a href="/wiki/Jordanian_general_election%2C_1989" title="Jordanian general election, 1989">1989</a> when <a href="/wiki/1989_Jordanian_protests" title="1989 Jordanian protests">riots over price hikes</a> spread in southern Jordan. In 1994 he became the second Arab head of state to sign <a href="/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Jordan_peace_treaty" title="Israel–Jordan peace treaty">a peace treaty</a> with Israel.</p>
<p>At the time of Hussein&#39;s accession, Jordan was a young nation and <a href="/wiki/Jordanian_annexation_of_the_West_Bank" title="Jordanian annexation of the West Bank">controlled</a> the <a href="/wiki/West_Bank" title="West Bank">West Bank</a>. The country had few natural resources, and a large Palestinian refugee population as a result of the <a href="/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War" title="1948 Arab–Israeli War">1948 Arab–Israeli War</a>. Hussein led his country through four turbulent decades of the <a href="/wiki/Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict" title="Arab–Israeli conflict">Arab–Israeli conflict</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, successfully balancing pressures from <a href="/wiki/Pan-Arabism" title="Pan-Arabism">Arab nationalists</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, <a href="/wiki/Western_countries" title="Western countries">Western countries</a>, and Israel, transforming Jordan by the end of his 46-year reign to a stable modern state. After 1967 he increasingly engaged in efforts to solve the <a href="/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict" title="Israeli–Palestinian conflict">Palestinian problem</a>. He acted as a conciliatory intermediate between various <a href="/wiki/Middle_East" title="Middle East">Middle Eastern</a> rivals, and came to be seen as the region&#39;s peacemaker. He was revered for pardoning political dissidents and opponents, and giving them senior posts in the government. Hussein, who survived dozens of assassination attempts and plots to overthrow him, was the region&#39;s longest-reigning leader. The King died at the age of 63 from cancer on 7 February 1999. <a href="/wiki/Death_and_state_funeral_of_King_Hussein" title="Death and state funeral of King Hussein">His funeral</a> was the largest gathering of world leaders since 1995. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Abdullah II.</p>

<p>On 9 December 1987 an Israeli truck driver ran over four Palestinians in a <a href="/wiki/Gaza_Strip" title="Gaza Strip">Gaza</a> refugee camp, sparking unrest that spread to violent demonstrations in the West Bank.{{sfn}} What began as an uprising to achieve Palestinian independence against the Israeli occupation turned into an upsurge of support for the PLO, which had orchestrated the uprising, and consequently diminished Jordanian influence in the West Bank.{{sfn}} Jordanian policy on the West Bank had to be reconsidered following renewed fears that Israel would revive its proposal for Jordan to become an &#34;alternative Palestinian homeland&#34;.{{sfn}} US Secretary of State <a href="/wiki/George_P._Shultz" title="George P.
