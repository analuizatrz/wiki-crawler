Abdullah was killed, but the 15-year-old Hussein survived the assassination attempt, and according to witnesses, pursued the gunman.

<p>Hussein was appointed Crown Prince of Jordan on 9 September 1951.

In March 1956, Hussein asserted Jordanian independence by dismissing <a href="/wiki/John_Bagot_Glubb" title="John Bagot Glubb">Glubb Pasha</a> as the commander of the Jordanian Army, and replacing all the British officers with Jordanians. This now mainly <a href="/wiki/Bedouin" title="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> army was fiercely loyal to him, due to tribal connections.</p>
<p>Hussein&#39;s rule was marked by repeated efforts to secure peace in the region. Meetings between King Hussein and Israeli foreign ministers <a href="/wiki/Abba_Eban" title="Abba Eban">Abba Eban</a> and <a href="/wiki/Golda_Meir" title="Golda Meir">Golda Meir</a> began on or before 1963.

<p>
King Hussein sought to understand Israel&#39;s position and preferred dialogue to the futility of war. Much of this desire grows out of the threat from other Arab states, specifically the Ba&#39;athist regimes in Iraq and Syria and Nasser&#39;s ideology of Arab nationalism which had heavily influenced the Army. The first secret meeting took place on 24 September 1963 between King Hussein and Yaacov Herzog, a diplomat with wide experience and special emissary of prime minister <a href="/wiki/Levi_Eshkol" title="Levi Eshkol">Levi Eshkol</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Among other things such as discussions regarding water rights, the purpose of the meetings were to plan and support Israeli and Jordanian initiatives in combating <a href="/wiki/Fatah" title="Fatah">Fatah</a> guerrillas. He would later state &#34;I told them I could not absorb a serious retaliatory raid, and they accepted the logic of this and promised there would never be one&#34;.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>On 13 November 1966, Israeli military conducted a major incursion into Jordanian territory, violating their secret agreement with King Hussein, in what became known as the <a href="/wiki/Samu_Incident" title="Samu Incident">Samu Incident</a>. Two days later, in response to the incident, in a memo to <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" title="President of the United States">U.S. President</a> <a href="/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson" title="Lyndon B. Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a>, his Special Assistant <a href="/wiki/Walt_Whitman_Rostow" title="Walt Whitman Rostow">Walt Rostow</a> wrote: &#34;retaliation is not the point in this case. This 3,000-man raid with tanks and planes was out of all proportion to the provocation and was aimed at the wrong target,&#34; and went on to describe the damage done to U.S. and Israeli interests:
</p><blockquote>They&#39;ve wrecked a good system of tacit cooperation between Hussein and the Israelis. ... They&#39;ve undercut Hussein. We&#39;ve spent $500 million to shore him up as a stabilizing factor on Israel&#39;s longest border and vis-à-vis Syria and Iraq. Israel&#39;s attack increases the pressure on him to counterattack not only from the more radical Arab governments and from the Palestinians in Jordan but also from the Army, which is his main source of support and may now press for a chance to recoup its Sunday losses. ... They&#39;ve set back progress toward a long term accommodation with the Arabs. ... They may have persuaded the Syrians that Israel didn&#39;t dare attack Soviet-protected Syria but could attack US-backed Jordan with impunity.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>
Perception of King Hussein&#39;s efforts to come to peaceful terms with Israel led to great dissatisfaction among some Arab leaders.  President <a href="/wiki/Gamal_Abdul_Nasser" title="Gamal Abdul Nasser">Gamal Abdul Nasser</a> of <a href="/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> often referred to Hussein as an, &#34;imperialist lackey&#34;.<sup id="_ref-bbc_onthisday" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bbc_onthisday" title="">[7]</a></sup> Army Commander-in-Chief General <a href="/wiki/Sharif_Zaid_Ben_Shaker" title="Sharif Zaid Ben Shaker">Sharif Zaid Ben Shaker</a> warned in a press conference that &#34;If Jordan does not join the war a civil war will erupt in Jordan&#34;.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> In order to maintain credibility in the Arab world and maintain stability at home, on 30 May 1967, King Hussein signed a mutual defense treaty with Egypt.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Improving_the_lives_of_Jordanians">Improving the lives of Jordanians</span></h2>
<p>Early on, King Hussein concentrated on building an economic and industrial infrastructure that would improve the quality of life of Jordanians. During the 1960s, Jordan&#39;s main industries – including phosphate, potash and cement – were developed, and a network of highways was built throughout the kingdom.</p>
<p>Social indicators reflect King Hussein&#39;s successes. While in 1950, water, sanitation and electricity were available to only 10% of Jordanians, today these reach 99% of the population. In 1960 only 33% of Jordanians were literate, while by 1996, this number had climbed to 85.5%. In 1961, the average Jordanian received a daily intake of 2198 calories, and by 1992, this figure had increased by 37.5% to reach 3022 calories. UNICEF statistics show that between 1981 and 1991, Jordan achieved the world&#39;s fastest annual rate of decline in infant mortality – from 70 deaths per 1000 births in 1981 to 37 per 1000 in 1991, a fall of over 47%.</p>

In June 1967, as a result of what later became known as the <a href="/wiki/Six-Day_War" title="Six-Day War">Six-Day War</a>, Jordan lost control of the <a href="/wiki/West_Bank" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> and saw its military shattered.

As a result, <a href="/wiki/Palestinian_refugee" title="Palestinian refugee">Palestinian refugees</a> who fled the 1948 and 1967 wars outnumbered Jordan&#39;s natural citizens. Most refugees were provided citizenship by the Jordanian government.
