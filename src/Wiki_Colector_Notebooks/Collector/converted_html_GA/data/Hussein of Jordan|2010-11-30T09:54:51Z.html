<p>On  20 July 1951, Prince Hussein traveled to <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> to perform <a href="/wiki/Friday_prayers" title="Friday prayers">Friday prayers</a> at the  <a href="/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Mosque" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> with his grandfather, <a href="/wiki/Abdullah_I_of_Jordan" title="Abdullah I of Jordan">King Abdullah I</a>. A Palestinian extremist, fearing the king might negotiate a peace with the newly created state of Israel, opened fire on Abdullah and his grandson. Abdullah was killed, but the 15-year-old Hussein survived the assassination attempt, and according to the Jordanian government, pursued the gunman. The Jordanian government claims that the gunman turned his weapon on the young prince, who was saved when the bullet was deflected by a medal on his uniform which had been given to him by his grandfather.<sup id="_ref-CNN1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CNN1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In his autobiography, <i>Uneasy Lies the Head</i>, Hussein recalls how three days before that fateful day in Jerusalem, his grandfather turned to him and said: &#34;<i>I hope you realize, my son, that one day you will have to assume responsibility. I look to you to do your very best to see that my work is not lost. I look to you to continue it in the service of our people.</i>”<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>He was appointed Crown Prince of Jordan on 9 September 1951. Abdullah&#39;s eldest son, <a href="/wiki/King_Talal" title="King Talal">King Talal</a>, became <a href="/wiki/King_of_Jordan" title="King of Jordan">King of Jordan</a>, but within a year was forced to abdicate owing to his mental state (European and Arab doctors diagnosed schizophrenia).<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> King Talal&#39;s son, Crown Prince Hussein, was proclaimed King of the <a href="/wiki/Hashemite_Kingdom_of_Jordan" title="Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan">Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan</a> on 11 August 1952, succeeding at the age of 16; because this was under the legal age, he was enthroned a year later, on  2 May 1953.<sup id="_ref-CNN1_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CNN1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>
In March 1956 Hussein established his authority over Jordan, and burnished his own nationalist credentials by dismissing <a href="/wiki/John_Bagot_Glubb" title="John Bagot Glubb">Glubb “Pasha”</a> as the commander of the Jordanian Army, and replacing all the British officers with Jordanians. This now mainly <a href="/wiki/Bedouin" title="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> army was fiercely loyal to him, due to tribal connections.</p>
<p>Hussein&#39;s rule was marred with secret collaboration with Israel and the United States, which often adversely affected the surrounding Arab States and peoples, including the Palestinians. Secret meetings between King Hussein and Israeli foreign ministers <a href="/wiki/Abba_Eban" title="Abba Eban">Abba Eban</a> and <a href="/wiki/Golda_Meir" title="Golda Meir">Golda Meir</a> began on or before 1963. The purpose of the meetings were to plan and support Israeli initiatives in combating <a href="/wiki/Fatah" title="Fatah">Fatah</a> guerrillas. Hussein accepted minor raids into Jordanian territory by the <a href="/wiki/Israeli_Defence_Forces" title="Israeli Defence Forces">Israeli Defence Forces</a>.  He would later state &#34;I told them I could not absorb a serious retaliatory raid, and they accepted the logic of this and promised there would never be one&#34;. <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>On Nov 13, 1966, Israeli military conducted a major incursion into Jordanian territory, violating their secret agreement with King Hussein, in what became known as the <a href="/wiki/Samu_Incident" title="Samu Incident">Samu Incident</a>. Two days later, in response to the incident, in a memo to <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" title="President of the United States">U.S. President</a> <a href="/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson" title="Lyndon B. Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a>, his Special Assistant <a href="/wiki/Walt_Whitman_Rostow" title="Walt Whitman Rostow">Walt Rostow</a> wrote: &#34;retaliation is not the point in this case. This 3000-man raid with tanks and planes was out of all proportion to the provocation and was aimed at the wrong target,&#34; and went on to describe the damage done to US and Israeli interests:
</p><blockquote>They&#39;ve wrecked a good system of tacit cooperation between Hussein and the Israelis... They&#39;ve undercut Hussein. We&#39;ve spent $500 million to shore him up as a stabilizing factor on Israel&#39;s longest border and vis-à-vis Syria and Iraq. Israel&#39;s attack increases the pressure on him to counterattack not only from the more radical Arab governments and from the Palestinians in Jordan but also from the Army, which is his main source of support and may now press for a chance to recoup its Sunday losses... They&#39;ve set back progress toward a long term accommodation with the Arabs... They may have persuaded the Syrians that Israel didn&#39;t dare attack Soviet-protected Syria but could attack US-backed Jordan with impunity.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Perception of King Hussein&#39;s secret collaboration with Israel lead to great dissatisfaction of his rule both at home and throughout the Arab World.  President <a href="/wiki/Gamal_Abdul_Nasser" title="Gamal Abdul Nasser">Gamal Abdul Nasser</a> of <a href="/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> often referred to Hussein as &#34;an &#34;imperialist lackey&#34;.<sup id="_ref-bbc_onthisday" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bbc_onthisday" title="">[7]</a></sup>  Army Commander-in-Chief General <a href="/wiki/Sharif_Zaid_Ben_Shaker" title="Sharif Zaid Ben Shaker">Sharif Zaid Ben Shaker</a> warned in a press conference that &#34;If Jordan does not join the war a civil war will erupt in Jordan&#34;.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup>  In order to maintain credibility in the Arab world and maintain stability at home, on May 30 1967, King Hussein signed a mutual defense treaty with Egypt, and handed over command of the Jordanian military to Egyptian generals.</p>
<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Six-Day_War">Six-Day War</span></h1>

In June 1967, Jordan along with Syria and Egypt were attacked by Israel, in what the Israeli government claimed was a <a href="/wiki/Pre-emptive_strike" title="pre-emptive strike">pre-emptive strike</a>. Jordan lost control of the <a href="/wiki/West_Bank" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> and <a href="/wiki/East_Jerusalem" title="east Jerusalem">east Jerusalem</a> and saw its military shattered.  In addition the country was, for a second time, over-run with many Palestinian refugees, fleeing the Israeli assault. Like on previous occasions, Israel did not allow the fleeing refugees to return to the territories it captured during the war.  As a result, Palestinian refugees who fled the 1948 and 1967 wars, outnumbered Jordan&#39;s natural citizens. Most refugees were provided citizenship by the Hussein regime. Due to their sheer numbers, Palestinian factions in Jordan were able to exercise considerable authority essentially governing some areas of Jordan, leading to many considering them a state within a state. <sup id="_ref-CNN2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CNN2" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>On Oct 6, 1973, Syria and Egypt attacked Israel without the aide of Jordan.

<dd>“My sister, Mrs. Leah Rabin, my friends, I had never thought that the moment would come like this when I would grieve the loss of a brother, a colleague and a friend — a man, a soldier who met us on the opposite side of a divide whom we respected as he respected us. A man I came to know because I realized, as he did, that we have to cross over the divide, establish a dialogue, get to know each other and strive to leave for those who follow us a legacy that is worthy of them. And so we did. And so we became brethren and friends... And as I stand here, I am obliged to you, to my people in Jordan and to the world, to keep on doing the utmost to guarantee that we leave behind a similar inheritance.“<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Summit_of_the_Peacemakers">Summit of the Peacemakers</span></h1>
<p>On  13 March 1996 the “Summit of the Peacemakers” was held at <a href="/wiki/Sharm_el-Sheikh" title="Sharm el-Sheikh">Sharm el-Sheikh</a>, <a href="/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> hosted by Egyptian President <a href="/wiki/Hosni_Mubarak" title="Hosni Mubarak">Hosni Mubarak</a>. Besides Hussein, those who attended included such dignitaries as Turkish President <a href="/wiki/Suleiman_Demirel" title="Suleiman Demirel">Suleiman Demirel</a>, Israeli Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Shimon_Peres" title="Shimon Peres">Shimon Peres</a>, US President <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>,  and Russian President <a href="/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin" title="Boris Yeltsin">Boris Yeltsin</a>. The summit was convened in order to put the Israeli-Palestinian peace process back on track after a spate of suicide bombings in Israel. In his address to the gathering, Hussein stressed that those who use religious justifications for terrorist acts have tarnished the image of <a href="/wiki/Islam" title="Islam">Islam</a>, which is a religion of peace, tolerance and dialogue. Hussein also said that a dual approach must be used in the fight against <a href="/wiki/Terrorism" title="terrorism">terrorism</a>. Sources of funding, training and operations must be cut off, and media coverage must not encourage terrorism. He added that States in the Middle East and throughout the world must eliminate those sources of despair that drive persons to perform such horrible actions, stating:</p>

<dd>“We must shoulder our responsibilities and work together to protect the <a href="/wiki/Dignity" title="dignity">dignity</a> of human beings, whoever and wherever they may be.”</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>{{Main}}
While refusing to negotiate on behalf of either the <a href="/wiki/Palestinians" title="Palestinians">Palestinians</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Israelis" title="Israelis">Israelis</a>, Hussein would offer ideas to bridge the gaps between the two parties. For instance, his 11th-hour intervention in January 1997 brought Palestinian Chairman <a href="/wiki/Yasser_Arafat" title="Yasser Arafat">Yasser Arafat</a> and Israeli Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu" title="Benjamin Netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> to an agreement on the long-awaited withdrawal of Israeli troops from most of the <a href="/wiki/West_Bank" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> town of <a href="/wiki/Hebron" title="Hebron">Hebron</a>.</p>
<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Wye_accords">The Wye accords</span></h1>
<p>{{Main}}
In 1997 when U.S. President <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> needed some prestigious heft to break the deadlock at the <a href="/wiki/Wye_River_Memorandum" title="Wye River Memorandum">Wye Plantation talks</a>, he invited Hussein, who was in the US undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer, to attend. Hussein received a standing ovation at the ceremony and praise from Clinton who said:</p>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>“The Jordanian Monarch was at the heart of the diplomatic breakthrough. His <a href="/wiki/Courage" title="courage">courage</a>, <a href="/wiki/Commitment" title="commitment">commitment</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wisdom" title="wisdom">wisdom</a> and, frankly, stern instruction at certain times, were at the heart of this success. Every time he was in the room, he made us all become a little closer to the people we all would like to see ourselves as being.”{{Citation needed}}</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Though the agreement hashed out at Wye followed the usual, complex course of mid-eastern affairs, Hussein’s input at the conference helped to sway the participants to at least begin to agree.{{citation needed}}</p>
<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Illness">Illness</span></h1>
<p>At the end of July 1998 Hussein made public a letter to his brother, Crown Prince Hassan, divulging that his doctors at the <a href="/wiki/Mayo_Clinic" title="Mayo Clinic">Mayo Clinic</a> thought he had <a href="/wiki/Lymphatic_cancer" title="lymphatic cancer">lymphatic cancer</a>. By the beginning of August they had confirmed it. Hussein&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Lymphoma" title="lymphoma">lymphoma</a> was of a type that responded to <a href="/wiki/Chemotherapy" title="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>, which the King had already begun and his physicians were optimistic he could be cured. Speaking on Jordanian television via <a href="/wiki/Satellite" title="satellite">satellite</a>, Hussein told his people, &#34;Rest assured, I am not over and done with.&#34; Nevertheless, he looked fragile and pale. It was the 62-year-old monarch&#39;s second bout with cancer; he lost a kidney to the disease in 1992.{{citation needed}}</p>
<p>On his way back to Jordan in January 1999, Hussein stopped in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>.<sup id="_ref-jordanembassyus.org" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jordanembassyus.org" title="">[15]</a></sup> Doctors advised him to rest and stay in England for a few weeks, as he was still too fragile to travel. The King declined. According to sources present, he stated that,</p>

<dl>
<dd>“I need very much to feel the warmth of my people around me, there is work to be done and I will get the strength from my people to finish the business.“<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Piloting his own aircraft<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> as he did hundreds of times, he touched down into <a href="/wiki/Marka" title="Marka">Marka</a> military airport, where he was greeted by Royal family members, ministers, parliament members, and Arab and foreign dignitaries. Upon landing, Hussein prayed on the tarmac and insisted, again against doctors advice, on riding in an open white <a href="/wiki/Limousine" title="limousine">limousine</a> as his <a href="/wiki/Motorcade" title="motorcade">motorcade</a> passed through downtown Amman, straight to his new home in <a href="/wiki/Al_Hummar" title="Al Hummar">Al Hummar</a>.<sup id="_ref-jordanembassyus.org_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jordanembassyus.org" title="">[15]</a></sup> It was a long journey in the pouring rain, and the king stood bravely greeting an estimated 2 million of his 4.6 million subjects who braved the elements and came out to greet their beloved monarch.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Death">Death</span></h1>
<p>Just before his death, Hussein made a constitutionally allowable change to his will, disinheriting the heir-apparent of several decades, his brother <a href="/wiki/Prince_Hassan_bin_Talal" title="Prince Hassan bin Talal">Hassan</a>, in favor of his eldest son <a href="/wiki/Abdullah_II_of_Jordan" title="Abdullah II of Jordan">Abdullah</a>. Then, with a recurrent fever, he abruptly returned to the U.S. clinic on 25 January 1999 for further treatment. He underwent a <a href="/wiki/Bone_marrow_transplant" title="bone marrow transplant">bone marrow transplant</a> earlier that week, but the transplant failed, and the king returned home to die.</p>
<p>On 7 February 1999 King Hussein died of complications related to <a href="/wiki/Non-Hodgkin&#39;s_lymphoma" title="non-Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma">non-Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma</a>. He was, at the time of his death, one of the longest-serving leaders in international politics.<sup id="_ref-CNN1_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CNN1" title="">[1]</a></sup> He had been the King of Jordan for over 46 years and in that time was plagued by a single problem that overshadowed every other in his political life: Peace in the Middle East. He did not live to see its resolution even though he is remembered as one whose efforts helped his neighbors, the Israelis and the Palestinians, to live in the peace that eluded him most of his life. In an interview with <a href="/wiki/CNN" title="CNN">CNN</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Christiane_Amanpour" title="Christiane Amanpour">Christiane Amanpour</a> in January 1999, Hussein stated:</p>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>“I still feel that those of us who work for <a href="/wiki/Peace" title="peace">peace</a> and believe in peace have a very, very loud voice, and hopefully, wisdom and <a href="/wiki/Common_sense" title="common sense">common sense</a> will prevail.“<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>On 8 February the flag-draped coffin carrying the body of the King left his home which he called the &#34;Door of Peace&#34; Palace after the peace he forged with Israel. All five of his sons were in close attendance and an honor guard of Bedouin troops accompanied the casket of the monarch on a 90-minute procession through the streets of the capital city of Amman. An estimated 800,000 Jordanians (an estimated 20% of the country&#39;s population at the time), many of them weeping, braved icy winds to say farewell to their leader.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> The funeral was attended by many dignitaries and statesmen from around the world.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> That same day the <a href="/wiki/UN_General_Assembly" title="UN General Assembly">UN General Assembly</a> held an Emergency Special Session in &#34;Tribute to the Memory of His Majesty the King of Jordan&#34;.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
