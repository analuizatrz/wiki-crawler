This family is part of the [[bird]] order [[Procellariiformes]] (or tubenoses), which also includes the [[albatross]]es, the [[storm-petrel]]s, and the [[diving petrel]]s. \\n\\nThe procellariids are the most numerous family of tubenoses, and the most diverse. They range in size from the [[giant petrel]]s, which are almost as large as the albatrosses, to the prions, which are as small as the larger storm-petrels. They feed on [[fish]], [[squid]] and [[crustacea]], with many also taking [[Discards|fisheries discards]] and [[carrion]]. All species are accomplished long-distance foragers, and many undertake long [[equator|trans-equatorial]] [[bird migration|migrations]]. They are [[seabird colony|colonial breeders]], exhibiting long-term [[Monogamy|mate fidelity]] and [[philopatry|site philopatry]]. In all species, each pair lays a single [[egg (biology)|egg]] per breeding season. Their incubation times and chick-rearing periods are exceptionally long compared to other birds. \\n\\nMany procellariids have breeding populations of over several million pairs; others number fewer than 200 birds. Humans have traditionally exploited several species of [[fulmar]] and shearwater (known as [[muttonbird]]s) for food, fuel, and bait, a practice that continues in a controlled fashion today. Several species are threatened by [[introduced species]] attacking adults and chicks in breeding colonies and by [[long-line fishing|long-line fisheries]].\\n\\n==Procellariid biology==\\n===Taxonomy and evolution===\\nAccording to the famous [[DNA hybridization]] study into [[bird|avian]] [[phylogenetic relationship]]s by [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy|Sibley and Ahlquist]], the split of the [[Procellariiformes]] into the four families occurred around 30 million years ago; a [[fossil]] bone often attributed to the order, described as the genus \\'\\'[[Tytthostonyx]]\\'\\', has been found in rocks dating around the [[Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event|Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary]] (70-60 [[mya (unit)|mya]]), but the remains are too incomplete for placement within the Procellariiformes to be certain.<ref>Dyke, G. & Van Tuinen, M., (2004) \"The evolutionary radiation of modern birds (Neornithes): reconciling molecules, morphology, and the fossil record\" \\'\\'Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society\\'\\', \\'\\'\\'141\\'\\'\\'(2): 153-177[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1111/j.1096-3642.2004.00118.x/abs/]</ref>\\nThe molecular evidence suggests that the storm-petrels were the first to diverge from the ancestral stock, and the albatrosses next, with the procellariids and diving petrels splitting most recently. Many taxonomists used to retain the [[diving petrel]]s in this family also, but today their distinctiveness is considered well supported.\\n\\nHowever, modern procellariid genera began to appear possibly just as early as the proposed splitting of the family, with a [[Rupelian]] (Early  [[Oligocene]]) fossil from [[Belgium]] tentatively attributed to the shearwater genus \\'\\'Puffinus\\'\\',<ref>\\'\\'Puffinus raemdonkii\\'\\' (see \\'\\'[[Puffinus]]\\'\\').

The Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, PA, and The American Ornithologists’ Union, Washington, D.C.</ref>\\nand most modern genera were established by the [[Miocene]]. Thus, a basal radiation of the Procellariiformes in the [[Eocene]] at least (as with many modern orders of birds) seems likely, especially given that significant anomalies in molecular evolution rates and patterns have been discovered in the entire family<ref name = \"Rheindt\">  Rheindt, F.

The two species in the genus \\'\\'Bulweria\\'\\' have long been considered to be gadfly petrels along with the 37 \\'\\'Pterodroma\\'\\' petrels, but newer research questions this.]] The procellariid family is usually broken up into four fairly distinct groups; the [[fulmarine petrel]]s, the [[gadfly petrel]]s, the [[prion (bird)|prions]], and the [[shearwater]]s.\\n\\n* The fulmarine petrels include the largest procellariids, the [[giant petrel]]s, as well as the two [[fulmar]] species, the [[Snow Petrel]], the [[Antarctic Petrel]], and the [[Cape Petrel]]. The fulmarine petrels are a diverse group with differing habits and appearances, but are linked [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] by their [[skull]] features, particularly the long prominent nasal tubes. \\n\\n* The gadfly petrels, so named due to their [[helter-skelter]] flight, are the 37 species in the [[genus]] \\'\\'Pterodroma\\'\\' and have traditionally included the two species in the genus \\'\\'[[Bulweria]]\\'\\'. The species vary from small to medium sizes (26–46&nbsp;cm; 10.2–18.1&nbsp;in), and are long winged with short hooked bills. The genus \\'\\'Pterodroma\\'\\' is now split into four sub genera,<ref> Imber, M.J., (1985) \"Origins, phylogeny and taxonomy of the gadfly petrels \\'\\'Pterodroma spp\\'\\'.\" \\'\\'Ibis\\'\\' 127: 197–229</ref> and some species have been split out of the genus (see below).\\n\\n* The prions comprise six species of true prion in the genus \\'\\'[[Pachyptila]]\\'\\' and the closely related [[Blue Petrel]]. Often known in the past as whalebirds, three species have large bills filled with [[Lamellae (zoology)|lamellae]] that they use to filter [[plankton]] somewhat as [[baleen whale]]s do, though the old name derives from their association with whales, not their bills (though \"prions\" does, deriving from [[Ancient Greek]] for \"[[saw]]\"). They are small procellariids (25–30&nbsp;cm; 10–12&nbsp;in) with grey, patterned plumage, all inhabiting the [[Southern Ocean]]. \\n\\n* The shearwaters are adapted for diving after prey instead of foraging on the ocean\\'s surface; one species has been recorded diving as deep as 70 metres (230&nbsp;ft). The shearwaters are also well known for the long trans-equatorial migrations undertaken by many species. The shearwaters include the 20 or so species of the genus \\'\\'[[Puffinus]]\\'\\', as well as the five large \\'\\'[[Procellaria]]\\'\\' species and the three \\'\\'[[Calonectris]]\\'\\' species. While all these three genera are known collectively as shearwaters, the \\'\\'Procellaria\\'\\' are called petrels in their common names. A recent study splits the shearwater genus \\'\\'Puffinus\\'\\' into two separate clades or subgroups, Puffinus and Neonectris. Puffinus are the \\'smaller\\' \\'\\'Puffinus\\'\\' shearwaters ([[Manx Shearwater|Manx]], [[Little Shearwater|Little]] and [[Audubon\\'s Shearwater]]s, for example), and the Neonectris are the \\'larger\\' \\'\\'Puffinus\\'\\' shearwaters ([[Sooty Shearwater]]s, for example); in 2004 it was proposed that Neonectris be split into its own genus, \\'\\'Ardenna\\'\\'.<ref name = \"wink\"> Penhallurick, J. and Wink, M.

The largest, the [[giant petrel]]s, are almost as large as [[albatross]]es; the smallest, such as the [[prion (bird)|prion]]s and some of the [[shearwater]]s, are slightly bigger than the [[diving petrel]]s. There are no obvious differences between the sexes, although females tend to be slighter.<ref name = \"Brooke\">Brooke, M.

The [[plumage]] of the procellariids is usually dull, with greys, blues, blacks and browns being the usual colours, although some species have striking patterns (such as the [[Cape Petrel]]).\\n\\n[[Image:Christmas shearwater takeoff.JPG|thumb|250px|left|The high wing loading of procellariids requires a high wing speed to remain airborne, so in order to take off this [[Christmas Shearwater]] \\'\\'Puffinus nativitatis\\'\\' must face into a strong wind. In calm conditions it must run in order to obtain a high wind speed.]] \\nThe technique of [[bird flight|flight]] among procellariids depends on foraging methods. Compared to an average bird, all procellariids have a high [[aspect ratio]] (meaning their wings are long and narrow) and a heavy [[wing loading]]. Therefore they must maintain a high speed in order to remain in the air. Most procellariids use two techniques to do this, namely, [[dynamic soaring]] and [[slope soaring]].<ref name =\"pen\">Pennycuick, C. J. (1982). \"The flight of petrels and albatrosses (Procellariiformes), observed in South Georgia and its vicinity\". \\'\\'Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'300\\'\\'\\': 75–106.</ref> Dynamic soaring involves gliding across wave fronts, thus taking advantage of the vertical [[wind gradient]] and minimising the effort required to stay in the air. Slope soaring is more straightforward: the procellariid turns to the wind, gaining height, from where it can then glide back down to the sea. Most procellariids aid their flight by means of flap-glides, where bursts of flapping are followed by a period of gliding; the amount of flapping dependent on the strength of the wind and the choppiness of the water.<ref name =\"war\">Warham, J. (1996). \\'\\'The Behaviour, Population, Biology and Physiology of the Petrels\\'\\'. London: Academic Press, ISBN 0-12-735415-8</ref> Shearwaters and other larger petrels, which have lower aspect ratio, must make more use of flapping to remain airborne than gadfly petrels. Because of the high speeds required for flight, procellariids need to either run or face into a strong wind in order to take off. \\n\\n[[Image:Giant petrel - Macronectes giganteus.jpg|thumb|250px|The flight of giant petrels is aided by a shoulder-lock that holds their wing out without effort.]]\\nThe giant petrels share with the albatrosses an adaptation known as a shoulder-lock: a sheet of [[tendon]] which locks the wing when fully extended, allowing the wing to be kept up and out without any muscle effort.  Gadfly petrels often feed on the wing, snapping prey without landing on the water. The flight of the smaller prions is similar to that of the [[storm-petrel]]s, being highly erratic and involving weaving and even looping the loop. The wings of all species are long and stiff. In some species of shearwater the wings are also used to power the birds underwater while diving for prey. Their heavier wing loadings, in comparison with surface-feeding procellariids, allow these shearwaters to achieve considerable depths (below 70&nbsp;m or 230&nbsp;ft in the case of the [[Short-tailed Shearwater]]).<ref>Weimerskirch, H., Cherel, Y., (1998) Feeding ecology of short-tailed shearwaters: breeding in Tasmania and foraging in the Antarctic? \\'\\'Marine Ecology Progress Series\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'167\\'\\'\\': 261–274</ref>\\n\\nProcellariids generally have weak legs, and many species move around on land by resting on the breast and pushing themselves forward, often with the help of their wings.<ref name =\"war\"/> The exception to this is the two species of giant petrel, which like the albatrosses, have strong legs used to feed on land (see below).

With the exception of the [[giant petrel]]s, all procellariids are exclusively [[ocean|marine]], and the diet of all species is dominated by either [[fish]], [[squid]], [[crustacean]]s and [[carrion]], or some combination thereof.\\n\\nThe majority of species are surface feeders, obtaining food that has been pushed to the surface by other predators or currents, or have floated in death. Among the surface feeders some, principally the [[gadfly petrel]]s, can obtain food by dipping from flight, while most of the rest feed while sitting on the water. These surface feeders are dependent on their prey being close to the surface, and for this reason procellariids are often found in association with other predators or oceanic convergences. Studies have shown strong associations between many different kinds of [[seabird]]s, including [[Wedge-tailed Shearwater]]s, and [[dolphin]]s and [[tuna]], which push shoaling fish up towards the surface.<ref name = \"AU\">Au, D.W.K. & Pitman, R.L.

These colonies vary in size from over a million birds to just a few pairs, and can be densely concentrated or widely spaced. At one extreme the [[Greater Shearwater]] nests in concentrations of 1 pair per square metre in three colonies of more than 1 million pairs,<ref name = \"Brooke\"/> whereas the giant petrels nest in clumped but widely spaced territories that barely qualify as colonial. Colonies are usually located near the coast, but some species nest far inland and even at high altitudes (such as the [[Barau\\'s Petrel]]). \\n\\nMost [[seabird]]s are colonial, and the reasons for colonial behaviour are assumed to be similar, if incompletely understood by scientists. Procellariids for the most part have weak legs and are unable to easily take off, making them highly vulnerable to [[mammal]]ian predators. Most procellariid colonies are located on islands that have historically been free of mammals; for this reason some species cannot help but be colonial as they are limited to a few locations to breed. Even species that breed on continental [[Antarctica]], such as the [[Antarctic Petrel]], are forced by habitat preference (snow-free north-facing rock) to breed in just a few locations.\\n\\n[[Image:Dark rumped petrel.jpeg|thumb|210px|The [[Hawaiian Petrel]] \\'\\'Pterodroma sandwichensis\\'\\' nests at high altitudes in burrows that are over 1 m deep.]]\\nMost procellariids\\' nests are in burrows or on the surface on open ground, with a smaller number nesting under the cover of vegetation (such as in a forest). All the fulmarine petrels bar the [[Snow Petrel]] nest in the open, the Snow Petrel instead nesting inside natural crevices. Of the rest of the procellariids the majority nest in burrows or crevices, with a few tropical species nesting in the open. There are several reasons for these differences. The fulmarine petrels are probably precluded from burrowing by their large size (the crevice-nesting Snow Petrel is the smallest fulmarine petrel) and the high latitudes they breed in, where frozen ground is difficult to burrow into. The smaller size of the other species, and their lack of agility on land, mean that even on islands free from mammal predators they are still vulnerable to [[skua]]s,<ref>Reinhard, K., Hahn, S., Peter, H.-U., Wemhoff, H., (2000).\"A review of the diets of Southern Hemisphere skuas.\" \\'\\'Marine Ornithology\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'28\\'\\'\\': 7–19.</ref> [[gull]]s and other avian predators, something the aggressive [[stomach oil|oil]]-spitting [[fulmar]]s are not. The chicks of all species are vulnerable to predation, but the chicks of fulmarine petrels can defend themselves in a similar fashion to their parents. In the higher latitudes there are thermal advantages to burrow nesting, as the temperature is more stable than on the surface, and there is no [[wind-chill]] to contend with. The absence of skuas, gulls and other predatory birds on [[tropical]] islands is why some [[shearwater]]s and two species of [[gadfly petrel]] can nest in the open. This has the advantages of reducing competition with burrow nesters from other species and allowing open-ground nesters to nest on [[coral]]line islets without soil for burrowing. Procellariids that burrow in order to avoid predation almost always attend their colonies [[nocturnal animal|nocturnally]] in order to reduce predation as well.<ref>Keitt, B.S., Tershy, B.R. & Croll, D.A (2004). \"Nocturnal behavior reduces predation pressure on Black-vented Shearwaters \\'\\'Puffinus opisthomelas\\'\\'\" \\'\\'Marine Ornithology\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'32\\'\\'\\' (3): 173-178.[http://www.marineornithology.org/PDF/32_2/32_2_173-178.pdf]</ref> Of the ground-nesting species the majority attend their colonies during the day, the exception being the [[Herald Petrel]], which is thought to be vulnerable to the diurnal [[White-bellied Sea Eagle]].\\n\\n[[Image:Christmas shearwater.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Christmas Shearwater]]s \\'\\'Puffinus nativitatis\\'\\' are one of the surface-breeding procellariids. Here a pair engages in some mutual preening.]]\\nProcellariids display high levels of [[philopatry]], exhibiting both natal philopatry and site fidelity. Natal philopatry, the tendency of a bird to breed close to where it hatched, is strong amongst all the Procellariiformes. The evidence for natal philopatry comes from several sources, not the least of which is the existence of several procellariid species that are endemic to a single island.<ref name = \"Brooke\"/> The study of [[mitochondrial DNA]] also provides evidence of restricted [[gene flow]] between different colonies, and has been used to show philopatry in [[Fairy Prion]]s.<ref>Ovenden, J.R., Wust-Saucy, A., Bywater, R., Brothers, N., White, R.W.G.

[http://scholar.google.com/url?sa=U&q=http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v108n03/p0688-p0694.pdf]</ref> [[Bird ringing]] also provides compelling evidence of philopatry; a study of [[Cory\\'s Shearwater]]s nesting near [[Corsica]] found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony actually bred in the burrow they were raised in.<ref>Rabouam, C., Thibault, J.-C., Bretagnolle, V., (1998) \"Natal Philopatry and Close Inbreeding in Cory\\'s Shearwater (\\'\\'Calonectris diomedea\\'\\')\" \\'\\'Auk\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'115\\'\\'\\'(2): 483–486 [http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v115n02/p0483-p0486.pdf]</ref> This tendency towards philopatry is stronger in some species than others, and several species readily prospect potential new colony sites and colonise them. It is hypothesised that there is a cost to dispersing to a new site, the chance of not finding a mate of the same species, that selects against it for rarer species, whereas there is probably an advantage to dispersal for species which have colony sites that change dramatically during periods of [[Glacial motion|glacial advance or retreat]]. There are also differences in the tendency to disperse based on sex, with females being more likely to breed away from the natal site.<ref name = \"Brooke\"/>\\n\\n====Mate and site fidelity====\\nProcellariids, as well as having strong natal philopatry, exhibit strong site fidelity, returning to the same nesting site, burrow or territory in sequential years. The figure varies for different species but is high for most species, an estimated 91% for [[Bulwer\\'s Petrel]]s.<ref>Mouguin, J-L., (1996) \"Faithfulness to mate and nest site of Bulwer\\'s Petrel, \\'\\'Bulweria bulweria\\'\\' at Selvagem Grande\" \\'\\'Marine Ornithology\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'24\\'\\'\\': 15–18.

Barcelona:Lynx Edicions, ISBN 84-87334-10-5</ref> Like the [[albatross]]es the procellariids take several years to reach sexual maturity, though due to the greater variety of sizes and lifestyles, the age of first breeding stretches from just three years in the smaller species to 12 years in the larger ones. \\n\\n[[Image:Fulmarus glacialis 1 8.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Northern Fulmar]] \\'\\'Fulmarus glacialis\\'\\' pair perform a cackling duet.]] \\nThe procellariids lack the elaborate breeding dances of the albatrosses, in no small part due to the tendency of most of them to attend colonies at night and breed in burrows, where visual displays are useless. The [[fulmarine petrel]]s, which nest on the surface and attend their colonies diurnally, do use a repertoire of stereotyped [[animal behaviour|behaviours]] such as cackling, preening, head waving and nibbling, but for most species courtship interactions are limited to some billing (rubbing the two bills together) in the burrow and the vocalisations made by all species. The calls serve a number of functions: they are used territorially to protect burrows or territories and to call for mates. Each call type is unique to a particular species and indeed it is possible for procellariids to identify the sex of the bird calling as well. It may also be possible to assess the quality of potential mates; a study of [[Blue Petrel]]s found a link between the [[rhythm]] and duration of calls and the body mass of the bird.<ref> Genevois, F; Bretagnolle, V (1994) \"Male Blue Petrels reveal their body mass when calling\"  \\'\\'Ethology Ecology & Evolution\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'6\\'\\'\\'(3): 377–383.</ref> The ability of an individual to recognise its mate has also been demonstrated in several species.\\n\\n====Breeding season====\\nLike most seabirds, the majority of procellariids breed once a year. There are exceptions; many individuals of the larger species, such as the [[White-headed Petrel]], will skip a breeding season after successfully [[fledge|fledging]] a chick, and some of the smaller species, such as the [[Christmas Shearwater]]s, breed on a nine-month schedule. Amongst those that breed annually, there is considerable variation as to the timing; some species breed in a fixed season whilst others breed all year round.  [[Climate]] and the availability of food resources are important influences on the timing of procellariid breeding; species that breed at higher [[latitude]]s always breed in the summer as conditions are too harsh in the winter. At lower latitudes many, but not all, species breed continuously. Some species breed seasonally, to avoid competition with other species for burrows, to avoid predation or to take advantage of seasonally abundant food. Others, such as the [[tropical]] [[Wedge-tailed Shearwater]], breed seasonally for reasons unknown. Among the species that exhibit seasonal breeding there can be high levels of synchronization, both of time of arrival at the colony and of lay date.<ref name = \"Brooke\"/>\\n\\nProcellariids begin to attend their nesting colony around one month prior to laying. Males will arrive first and attend the colony more frequently than females, partly in order to protect a site or burrow from potential competitors. Prior to laying there is a period known as the pre-laying exodus in which both the male and female are away from the colony, building up reserves in order to lay and undertake the first incubation stint respectively. This pre-laying exodus can vary in length from 9 days (as in the [[Cape Petrel]])<ref> Weidinger, K (1996) \"Patterns of colony attendance in the Cape Petrel \\'\\'Daption capense\\'\\' at Nelson Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica\"  \\'\\'Ibis\\'\\'.\\'\\'\\'138\\'\\'\\'(2): 243–249.</ref> to around 50 days in [[Atlantic Petrel]]s.<ref>Cuthbert, R., (2004) \"Breeding biology of the Atlantic Petrel, \\'\\'Pterodroma incerta\\'\\', and a population estimate of this and other burrowing petrels on Gough Island, South Atlantic Ocean\" \\'\\'Emu\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'104\\'\\'\\'(3): 221–228 </ref> All procellariids lay one [[egg (biology)|egg]] per pair per breeding season, in common with the rest of the Procellariiformes. The egg is large compared to that of other birds, weighing 6–24% of the female\\'s weight. Immediately after laying the female goes back to sea to feed while the male takes over incubation. Incubation duties are shared by both sexes in shifts that vary in length between species, individuals and even the stage of incubation. The longest recorded shift was 29 days by a [[Murphy\\'s Petrel]] from [[Henderson Island]]; the typical length of a [[gadfly petrel]] stint is between 13 and 19 days. [[Fulmarine petrel]]s, [[shearwater]]s and [[prion (bird)|prions]] tend to have shorter stints, averaging between 3 to 13 days. Incubation takes a long time, from 40 days for the smaller species (such as prions) to around 55 days for the larger species. The incubation period is longer if eggs are abandoned temporarily; procellariid eggs are resistant to chilling and can still hatch after being left unattended for a few days. \\n[[Image:Pterodroma hypoleuca.jpg|thumb|250px|The chick of a [[Bonin Petrel]] \\'\\'Pterodroma hypoleuca\\'\\' takes almost three months to fledge. This chick has most of its adult plumage but still retains a considerable amount of down.]]\\nAfter hatching the chick is brooded by a parent until it is large enough to [[thermoregulation|thermoregulate]] efficiently, and in some cases defend itself from predation. This guard stage lasts a short while for burrow-nesting species (2–3 days) but longer for surface nesting [[fulmar]]s (around 16–20 days) and [[giant petrel]]s (20–30 days). After the guard stage both parents feed the chick. In many species the parent\\'s foraging strategy alternates between short trips lasting 1–3 days and longer trips of 5 days.<ref>Weimerskirch, H., Chastel, O., Ackermann, L., Chaurand, T., Cuenot-Chaillet, F., Hindermeyer, X. & Judas, J., (1994) \"Alternate long and short foraging trips in pelagic seabird parents\" \\'\\'Animal Behaviour\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'47\\'\\'\\': 472–476</ref> The shorter trips, which are taken over the continental shelf, benefit the chick with faster growth, but longer trips to more productive [[pelagic zone|pelagic]] feeding grounds are needed for the parents to maintain their own body condition. The meals are composed of both prey items and [[stomach oil]], an [[food energy|energy]]-rich food that is lighter to carry than undigested prey items.<ref>Warham, J. (1976) \"The incidence, function and ecological significance of petrel stomach oils.\" \\'\\'Proceedings of the New Zealand Ecological Society\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'24\\'\\'\\': 84–93 [http://www.nzes.org.nz/nzje/free_issues/ProNZES24_84.pdf]</ref> This oil is created in a stomach organ known as a proventriculus from digested prey items, and gives procellariids and other Procellariifromes their distinctive musty smell. Chick development is quite slow for [[bird]]s, with [[fledge|fledging]] taking place at around 2 months after hatching for the smaller species and 4 months for the largest species. The chicks of some species are abandoned by the parents; parents of other species continue to bring food to the nesting site after the chick has left. All procellariid chicks fledge by themselves, and there is no further parental care after fledging.\\n\\n==Procellariids and humans==\\n===Exploitation of procellariids===\\n[[Image:Puffinus griseus.png|thumb|left|[[Sooty Shearwater]]s \\'\\'Puffinus griseus\\'\\' are still harvested in New Zealand using traditional techniques]]\\nProcellariids have been a seasonally abundant source of food for people wherever people have been able to reach their colonies. Early records of human exploitation of shearwaters (along with [[albatross]]es and [[cormorant]]s) come from the remains of [[hunter-gatherer]] [[midden]]s in southern [[Chile]], where [[Sooty Shearwater]]s were taken 5000 years ago.<ref>Simeone, A. & Navarro, X.

The hunting pressure on the [[Bermuda Petrel]], or Cahow, was so intense that the species nearly went extinct and did go missing for 300 years. The name of one species, the [[Providence Petrel]], is derived from its (seemingly) miraculous arrival on [[Norfolk Island]], where it provided a windfall for starving European settlers;<ref name = \"Anderson\">Anderson, A.

More sustainable shearwater harvesting industries developed in [[Tasmania]] and [[New Zealand]], where the practice of harvesting what are known as [[muttonbird]]s continues today.\\n\\n===Threats and conservation===\\nWhilst some species of procellariid have populations that number in the millions, many species are much less common and several are threatened with [[extinction]]. Human activities have caused dramatic declines in the numbers of some species, particularly species that were originally restricted to one island. According to the [[IUCN]] 36 species are listed as vulnerable or worse, with ten critically endangered.<ref>IUCN, 2004.

Procellariids overwhelmingly breed on islands away from land predators such as mammals, and for the most part have lost the defensive adaptations needed to deal with them (with the exception of the [[stomach oil|oil]]-spitting [[fulmarine petrel]]s). The introduction of mammal predators such as [[feral cat]]s, [[rat]]s, [[mongoose]]s and even [[mice]] can have disastrous results for [[island tameness|ecologically naïve]] [[seabird]]s.<ref>Moors, P.J. & Atkinson, I.A.E.

Burrowing species that leave their young unattended at a very early stage are particularly vulnerable to attack. Studies on [[Grey-faced Petrel]]s breeding on New Zealand\\'s [[Whale Island, New Zealand|Whale Island]] (Moutohora) have shown that a population under heavy pressure from [[Norway Rat]]s will produce virtually no young during a breeding season, whereas if the rats are controlled (through the use of poison), breeding success is much higher.<ref name =\"imber2000\">Imber, M., Harrison, M. & Harrsion, J.

Interactions with introduced species can be quite complex. [[Gould’s Petrel]]s breed only on two islands, Cabbage Tree Island and Boondelbah Island off [[New South Wales]]. Introduced rabbits destroyed the forest understory on Cabbage Tree Island; this both increased the vulnerability of the petrels to natural predators and left them vulnerable to the sticky fruits of the birdlime tree (\\'\\'[[Pisonia]] umbellifera\\'\\'), a native plant. In the natural state these fruits lodge in the understory of the forest, but with the understory removed the fruits fall to the ground where the petrels move about, sticking to their feathers and making flight impossible.<ref name =\"car\">Carlile, N., Proiddel, D., Zino, F., Natividad, C. & Wingate, D.B.

Focusing on Brasil, the proper and official names should be listed in the Brazilian versions with clear English translations. Even though the article is in English, the country is not. So, even the \"common\" name for Brasil should be stated as \"Brasil\". Then, yes, there are official English versions of the names. These should be stated as such along with any reference that makes them so. (For example--to be researched and verified--the US Bureau of Standards specified English versions, the US Congress specified recognized English versions, the Mexican congress specified English versions, etc.)\\n\\nThe actual name of the article, however, can certainly be left in the English common version, \"Brazil\", because it is an English encyclopedia and the most commonly used version of the name.

This section has several issues that I would like to address:\\n\\n* \\'\\'\\'Link between social issues and level of crime\\'\\'\\' - I\\'ve already expressed my concerns about that in previous discussions. There is no proven relation between the two issues. The relation between crime and social conditions is still highly debatable and non-conclusive. Therefore, I propose the removal from that section of any statement that connects these two separate subjects.\\n\\n* \\'\\'\\'Brazil has been unable to reflect its recent economic achievements into social development\\'\\'\\' - We cannot confirm that. Furthermore this statement is unreferenced. There has been in recent years, some social improvements such as the \"Bolsa escola\", \"bolsa familia\", more  children enrolled in schools than in the past, etc. I understand that every encyclopedic content must show a balanced view of facts, not just one side of the equation.\\n\\n* \\'\\'\\'The rate of poverty is in part attributed to the country\\'s economic inequality\\'\\'\\' - Unreferenced and debatable statement.\\n\\n* \\'\\'\\'While the Northeast region has the worst economic indicators nationwide, many cities in the South and Southeast enjoy First World socioeconomic standards,[2] with roughly 23.8 homicides per 100,000 residents.[3] Muggings, robberies, kidnappings[4] and gang violence[5] are common in the largest cities.\\'\\'\\' - Again, the section is about social issues and the text correlates this with crime issues. I propose to remove every statistics about crime and keep focused on social issues.\\n\\n* \\'\\'\\'Brazil currently ranks 70th in the Human Development Index list, with a high HDI (0,800).\\'\\'\\' - This statement is a bit contradictory, it places Brazil in a low rank but it highlights its high HDI. I propose removing the HDI comment.\\n\\n<br>\\n\\n===Grammar issues===\\n\\n* \\'\\'\\'Brazil ranks among the world\\'s highest nations in the Gini coefficient index of inequality assessment\\'\\'\\' - I suppose there is a grammatic issue in this phrase, I suppose we should read it as : \\'\\'\\'Brazil ranks among the world\\'s highest Gini coefficient index of inequality assessment\\'\\'\\'. This statement is followed by:\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'According to Fundação Getúlio Vargas, in June 2006 the rate of misery based on labour income was of 18.57% of the population[1] — a 19.8% reduction during the previous four years.\\'\\'\\' \\n\\nwhich has nothing to do with how the Gini coefficient is calculated. Furthermore, the last sentence should be read: \\'\\'\\'\"...a 19.8% reduction from the previous four years.\"\\'\\'\\'\\n\\n* \\'\\'\\'...remote upcountry regions that suffer with economic underdevelopment and below-par standards of living...\\'\\'\\' It should read:\\n\\n\"...remote upcountry regions that suffer from economic underdevelopment and low standards of living...\"\\n\\n\"... constitutional requirements set in article 7, IV, regarding living standards.\" It should read:\\n\\n\"... constitutional requirements set in article 7, IV, regarding standards of living.\"\\n\\n[[User:Mhsb|Mhsb]] ([[User talk:Mhsb|talk]]) 03:42, 20 March 2008 (UTC)\\n\\n:First of all, it would be great if whoever just restarted this discussion signed his or her comments.\\n\\n:I’m the person who “wrote” most of the current contents of the “social issues” section and I understand it’s a delicate topic. Obviously the section isn’t perfect, and I’m open to new ideas. However, I don’t agree with some of the criticism that has just been made. \\n\\n:* \\'\\'\\'Link between social issues and level of crime\\'\\'\\'. Crime is a social issue itself, so I don’t see the problem here. I guess you don’t agree with a link between poverty and crime, but the article doesn’t establish this type of link. It is simply mentioning different types of social problems – crime, poverty, a badly structured social security system, lack of infrastructure and so on. The text is not directly connecting poverty to crime, although they appear in the same paragraph. Maybe the information could be reorganized.\\n\\n:* \\'\\'\\'Brazil has been unable to reflect its recent economic achievements into social development\\'\\'\\' This used to be part of the introduction and it should have stayed there. Brazil still has dramatic problems regarding the public education, health and social security systems. I don’t understand why you are saying “we can’t confirm this”. It’s a widely accepted fact.\\n\\n:* \\'\\'\\'The rate of poverty is in part attributed to the country\\'s economic inequality\\'\\'\\' The rate of poverty is obviously related to the country’s economic inequality. Any economist will confirm that claim. The only reason we opted for “in part attributed” is the existance of other factors also affecting poverty.\\n\\n:* \\'\\'\\'Brazil currently ranks 70th in the Human Development Index list, with a high HDI (0,800).\\'\\'\\' I agree with your criticism here. I think this sentence should be removed or something like “although Brazil faces several social issues, it is has a high ranking in the HDI chart” could be added.\\n\\n:As for the grammar issues, I see no problems in your suggestions.\\n\\n:[[User:Sparks1979|Sparks1979]] ([[User talk:Sparks1979|talk]]) 02:20, 20 March 2008 (UTC)\\n\\n:: Sorry for not signing on my previous edits, my bad, I fixed that. Following the discussions, regarding the issues you highlighted:\\n\\n:* \\'\\'\\'Link between social issues and level of crime\\'\\'\\'. Crime is a social issue itself, so I don’t see the problem here. I guess you don’t agree with a link between poverty and crime, but the article doesn’t establish this type of link.

The text is not directly connecting poverty to crime, although they appear in the same paragraph. Maybe the information could be reorganized.\\n\\n=> I agree that crime is a social issue itself, however, what I disagree is the way the section is suggesting that the root cause of crime is social inequality. If the article wants to discuss crime issues, my suggestion is that this should be placed in another topic, not under \"social issues\".\\n\\n:* \\'\\'\\'Brazil has been unable to reflect its recent economic achievements into social development\\'\\'\\' This used to be part of the introduction and it should have stayed there. Brazil still has dramatic problems regarding the public education, health and social security systems. I don’t understand why you are saying “we can’t confirm this”. It’s a widely accepted fact.\\n\\n=> I am not denying that all those problems you\\'ve listed have been solved. What I am questioning is the statement that there has been no social developments at all as a result of economic achievements because there has been, in fact, some social development landmarks. May be the word \"reflect\"here is misplaced or the statement lacks reference.\\n\\n:* \\'\\'\\'The rate of poverty is in part attributed to the country\\'s economic inequality\\'\\'\\' The rate of poverty is obviously related to the country’s economic inequality. Any economist will confirm that claim. The only reason we opted for “in part attributed” is the existance of other factors also affecting poverty.\\n\\n=> Sorry, but this statement is debatable and if you have any reference it would be great to add to it. For instance, Japan\\'s gini index is higher than India, but India is poorer than Japan. If everyone is poor, economic inequality is lower and the country as a whole is poor. Furthermore, this kind of discussion goes well beyond the scope of the section and the article itself.\\n\\n:* \\'\\'\\'Brazil currently ranks 70th in the Human Development Index list, with a high HDI (0,800).\\'\\'\\' I agree with your criticism here. I think this sentence should be removed or something like “although Brazil faces several social issues, it is has a high ranking in the HDI chart” could be added.\\n\\n=> Agreed.\\n\\n[[User:Mhsb|Mhsb]] ([[User talk:Mhsb|talk]]) 03:42, 20 March 2008 (UTC)\\n\\n===Suggested new text===\\n\\n{{Main|Social issues in Brazil}}\\n\\n[[Image:Rocinha Favela.jpg|right|thumb|Located between some of the richest areas of [[Rio de Janeiro]], the [[Rocinha]] \\'\\'[[favela]]\\'\\' is testimony to high [[economic inequality]] within Brazil.]]\\n\\nBesides Brazil\\'s recent economic achievements, the country faces serious social problems.

Although the rate of people living below the poverty line has improved in recent years, there is still a lot of poverty in Brazil. Also, Brazil has one of the world’s highest rates of economic disparities between the rich and poor classes. This is a well-documented fact and it must be mentioned under a “social issues” section. If you don’t want to establish a link between poverty and social inequalities, that’s fine, but we can’t simply skip these aspects of Brazilian life.\\n\\n:=> It keeps the text simple.

A person that is not familiar with Brazil or with favelas needs a short explanation of what the picture is showing.\\n\\n:=> It keeps the text simple. There is no need to list all types of crimes in the section. The main section will detail those issues. Furthermore, the section is about social issues, not crime issues.\\n\\n::A social issues section about Brazil that doesn\\'t mention crime is useless. Crime is considered one of the main social problems in Brazil in any random poll. If you talk about social issues in Brazil without mentioning poverty and crime the fact is you aren’t truly talking about social issues in Brazil. You would do a better job scrapping the whole section, and that would be a step backwards for the article. \\n\\n:=> It keeps the section simple. There is no need to cite the article and section of the constitution. HDI index is discussed further ahead.\\n\\n::You need to mention the minimum wage constitutional article so the casual reader can know where the “official requirements” are found. Deleting this would be like deleting a reference. “Keeping the text simple” isn’t really a very good argument if it comes at the cost of keeping the text incomplete or lacking references.\\n\\n:=> Provides unbalanced information.\\n\\n::I agree this needs to be reviewed. It sounds a bit contradictory.\\n\\n:If we follow your suggestions, we would have a social issues section that doesn’t talk about social issues. Also, the reasoning behind most of the changes is “keeping the section simple”, when it comes at the cost of removing vital information. If we followed your advice, we would have a Brazilian social issues section that doesn’t mention poverty, social inequalities, violence, problems with the minimal wages and so on. In other words, we wouldn’t talk about any of the main social problems that affect the daily life of most Brazilians. Therefore, I have to disagree with them.  \\n\\n:I say instead of removing all this crucial information, we should work on reorganizing the text so it looks more scientific and technical, that is, let’s improve grammar use, let’s avoid contradictions, etc, but let’s not remove essential data in the process.  \\n\\n:[[User:Sparks1979|Sparks1979]] ([[User talk:Sparks1979|talk]]) 05:16, 23 March 2008 (UTC)\\n\\nPoverty, urban violence, growing social security debts, inefficient public services, and the low value of the minimum wage are some of the main social issues that currently challenge the Brazilian government.\\n\\n::OK, good enough, let\\'s recap the section:\\n\\nThe topic about social issues begin talking about economic inequality, poverty, then economic inequality between regions, it lists some types of crime, it talks about police brutality and corruption, then inefficient public services, low minimal wage, then about high HDI and finally, the social security system. Structurally, I must agree with you that this section needs organisation. Furthermore, we need to distribute the information avoiding undue weight on some of the issues, such as crime. We need to balance the information in order to comply with [[WP:NPOV]]. I agree that crime is a social issue, but we need to avoid undue weight, otherwise we run the risk to talk about another subject instead of social issues. I should list below some Brazilian social issues:\\n\\n* Low minimum wage\\n* Inefficient pension system\\n* Poor health services\\n* Poor social security services\\n* High level of violent crimes\\n* Income inequality\\n* High illiteracy rate \\n* Difference on life expectancy  <small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mhsb|Mhsb]] ([[User talk:Mhsb|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mhsb|contribs]]) 01:49, 25 March 2008 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\\n* Other issues\\n\\nWe need to distribute the information along the suggested issues and then we need to balance the information by talking about what has been done or have been achieved to address those issues, even if they haven\\'t solved all the issues. This creates unbalanced opinion and keep the section neutral. Furthermore, we have to make the section short, keeping in mind that the article is about the country and that the article should size below 80K, current size is bearing 100KB. There are still lots of work to bring this article as a feature one and to me, this section is where we have multiple problems, starting with grammar and misspellings.\\n\\n--[[User:Mhsb|Mhsb]] ([[User talk:Mhsb|talk]]) 03:47, 24 March 2008 (UTC)\\n\\n:I agree with what you said in your last post.

If you read any GA or FA article on a third world country, you will see their social issues scattered along the article. The only difference here is we created a subsection for this and many people like it this way, since it looks more organized. The article has had this subsection since its creation many years ago. By the way, the \"culture\" section is larger than the \"social issues\" subsection. \"Culture\" includes an introduction, \"religion\" and \"sports\" - I think you were looking only at the introduction.

That\\'s a political definition that wrongly \"classify\" a group of countries (\"first world\" or \"developed\") automatically better than another group (\"third world\"). Things are not blank or white like that. All countries have good and bad things (rich countries also have lots of problems). So, if there is a need to include that sub-section, it must \\'\\'\\'not\\'\\'\\' be because Brazil is classify as such thing, but because that\\'s an outstanding issue for Brazil that readers should know about it right away. --[[User:ClaudioMB|ClaudioMB]] ([[User talk:ClaudioMB|talk]]) 04:21, 31 March 2008 (UTC)\\n\\n:::::What\\'s the problem with \"third world\" or \"developing\"? They are widely used terms, both by the general public and by scholars. If you don\\'t like them, fine, but Wikipedia is not a place where we edit things according to our personal taste. Also, I don\\'t understand your reasoning when you say information must be \"outstanding\" in order to be included in the article. [[User:Sparks1979|Sparks1979]] ([[User talk:Sparks1979|talk]]) 22:01, 1 April 2008 (UTC)\\n\\n::::::First, classifying countries as \"first\" and \"third\" gives the idea of better and worse. That\\'s is rude, even if it\\'s true. Second and worse, that classification is not scientifically based, it\\'s politically based. So, politically classify countries as better or worse is discriminatory and offensive. That is the closest you can get to racism (only replacing people for countries). Also, that gives an unfair advantage to those \"first world\" countries, because as long they are \"better\" than others, their products, ideas and political views are automatically \"better\". No wonder their media spread so well those terms.\\n::::::About the social issues, you cannot define an article based on others. Each article is independent. Even if you want to consider other articles, you\\'ll always find examples on both sides (for example: FA article [[Bangladesh]], [[Cambodia]], [[Chad]], [[Indonesia]] and [[India]] don\\'t mention social issues. I stopped in India and I couldn\\'t find one mentioning social issues). If social issues are outstanding (essential and very important to know Brazil), then it should be on the main page. I don\\'t agree, I see the ethnic composition of Brazil\\'s population much more important, because it\\'s unique in the world. That should be a sub-section. The only point in social issues I see as outstanding is the Gini coefficient, because Brazil has one of the worst in the world (and it\\'s scientifically proved). That could be placed in the introduction with some data about poverty. But, urban violence, growing social security debts (I bet France and Germany beat Brazil on that), inefficient public services, and the low value of the minimum wage are  public administration issues and they are not part of the big picture.\\n:::::::It\\'s not rude if it\\'s true. It\\'s a fact. Who says this has no scientific basis? Any book on History and Geography will talk about \"developing nations\" and \"third world countries\". Granted, the first term is slowly getting more popular, but the idea is still the same. Even our own government admits we\\'re a developing nation. If you think \"social issues\" are an important part of Brazilian life, or an \"outstanding\" part as you say it, then I\\'m afraid you are gathering your knowledge about Brazil from postcards and tourism magazines.

The Non-Aligned Nations took up this phrase to proudly indicate that they were unaligned with either side in this conflict.  It originated with a French writer (Alfred Sauvy) who declared that the capitalist West was like the nobility (the French \"First Estate\"), the Communist East was like the clergy (the \"Second Estate\") and the rest of the world was the common man (the \"Third Estate\").  It was a term of praise, because in the French Revolution, the common man rose up and overthrew the clergy and nobility to declare a government managed by the masses, and Sauvy believed that the Third World would in time be the real power on Earth.  It truly had nothing to do with \"better or worse\" as a ranking of countries, but was a reference to the French Revolution.\\n[[User:Bishop^|Bishop^]] ([[User talk:Bishop^|talk]]) 16:33, 3 April 2008 (UTC)\\n:Yes, but the term has been associated with \"developing nations\" for a long time. If you dislike the term, then call Brazil a \"developing nation\" instead of a \"third world country\". This is a matter of semantics, but the idea is still the same.

But that definition has been lost for a quite some time (\"second\" world doesn\\'t even exist more). The media have already changed that definition. I bet, currently, 99% of the world population associate those terms as a ranking. That\\'s different from the term [[Western world]] (used by western media as synonym for \"first world\").

I assure you this is not the last time there will be a discussion regarding the social issues section in Brazil. Since the [[Brazil]] page was created we\\'ve always had this discussion, and this is one of the reasons this article will probably never be a Featured Article. The article editors have always been divided into two groups: people that propose a more \"realistic\" version of Brazil, and people that support a \"light\" version of Brazil. I think you understand what I mean. I don\\'t know which editors are in which group, I can only guess... lol. I have worked a lot on this page in the past, and I\\'m happy to see a good part of my work is still here after almost a year has passed, so I guess it wasn\\'t too bad. However since the last big debate related to the sport section pictures, I decided I would no longer work on controversial pages. Brazil is a page that is permanently locked. That shows just how difficult it is to work here. I think you shouldn\\'t have removed the social issues subsection because many editors support it. Many of these editors aren\\'t here anymore, but you can still find their opinions in the archive pages. Even now, you can still see I\\'m no alone here - Opinoso and Dunadan agree with me.

What I am trying to argue here is that social issues is a very broad and complex concept that encompasses several areas. I am trying to expand the main article, [[Social issues in Brazil]], in order to embrace those concepts, so as we can have a more reliable section under the article [[Brazil]]. Please see [[Talk:Social issues in Brazil]] page to see my opinion to improve the page. Also, have a look on the page [[Social issues in the United States]] and compare its format, not its contents because we are talking about different countries. For Brazil, I believe that the major social issues would be in the areas of:\\n\\n* Education - the education systems, public x private education, quality of education, illiteracy, child\\'s work and school evasion, \"Bolsa Familia\" program, One Laptop per child program, etc.\\n* Health - the decentralisation of the Heath system and the SUS system, private x public health and their partnership with SUS, Health insurance issues and its distribution among the population, tropical diseases, infant mortality, life expectancy, generic anti-HIV/AIDS program, generic medicines, government efforts to fund the health systems such as the CPMF, higher budget to health than to defense, etc\\n* Indigenous peoples - diseases, land rights\\n* Black people - history of slavery, huge economic gulf existed in the country between the black and white population, racial quotas for universities, extension of the same quota system to civil service jobs, the private sector and even television.\\n* Poverty and inequality - famine, difference between regions, cities ans classes, high inequality rate, \"Fome Zero\" program, \"Bolsa Familia\" program, etc\\n* Crime - low paid police, drug gangs and the organised crime, the \"favelas\", transnational crime and border control, construction of Federal prisons, creation of National Public Security Force, etc\\n* Retirement and the pension system - large deficits, public x private gap of paid benefits, reform of the system, Parallel PEC and the projects to privatise the social security system.\\n* The landless and land reform plans - the MST movement, the land issue in Brazil, the redistribution of land by the government, etc\\n\\nSo, from my point of view, the section that I removed from this article didn\\'t contemplate 30% of the issues above listed. Therefore, i propose to workout the article [[Social issues in Brazil]] before we proceed to include such a section here. Myself and Carlosguitar made some changes in the article but this is a big task and we need help from other editors...\\n\\n--[[User:Mhsb|Mhsb]] ([[User talk:Mhsb|talk]]) 00:00, 8 April 2008 (UTC)\\n\\n::I still believe that Social issues have no place in a country\\'s main page. A main page cannot be too long and there are many more important topics. This page is already too long (92k) and need to be reduced. Wikipedia suggest that an article should not be more than 50k ([[Wikipedia:Article size]]). Another problem is, why only social issues? If we include it, why not include ecological issues, economic issues, culture issues... Only because the media gets large audience showing too much of it, that doesn\\'t make it the only and most important issue. Also, issues are too much of [[Wikipedia:Recentism|recentism]]. So, another article dedicated to it will be more reasonable.--[[User:ClaudioMB|ClaudioMB]] ([[User talk:ClaudioMB|talk]]) 06:27, 8 April 2008 (UTC)\\n\\n===No democracy?===\\n\\nWe\\'ve always had many debates, discussions, and sometimes even fights in this page. However, in most cases we tried to find democratic solutions to resolve each problem. This time I\\'m surprised to see there was no \"debate\". There are three users supporting the \"social issues\" subsection - [[User:Sparks1979|Sparks1979]], [[User:Opinoso|Opinoso]] and [[User:Dúnadan|<font color=\"blue\">the</font> <font color=\"#339900\">D</font><font color=\"blue\">únadan</font>]]. That\\'s three people or three votes. Then there are three editors who want to see the social issues subsection removed or revamped: [[User:ClaudioMB|ClaudioMB]], [[User talk:Carlosguitar|Carlosguitar]], --[[User:Mhsb|Mhsb]]. That\\'s clearly a 3x3 score. So far so good - the problem here is that for some reason the opinion of the first three users was completely ignored, and the subsection was removed without much of a debate. Is this how democracy works in Wikipedia? Even if there was a majority either way, it would have to be an overwhelming majority, or else changes should be put on hold until an agreement is reached. Quite frankly, I have a feeling something unfair was carried out over here. \\n\\nI haven\\'t been very interested in this page since the last big discussion occured some time at the end of last year, when people were fighting over the pictures in the sports section. I think that showed just how difficult it is to work on pages like [[Brazil]] or [[Mexico]]. People make everything here too personal. Wikipedia is meant to be a place where people have fun and share knowledge, not a fight arena. Why does this page have to be locked constantly? I guess we will never make it to Featured Article - not because the contents aren\\'t good, but because this article will probably never be stable.\\n\\nI see no problem at all if people want to make changes - that\\'s what Wikipedia is all about. The problem is that changes should be made in a democratic way, and I don\\'t see that happening here, at least not at the moment. Many people support the social issues section. If we look at the archives, we will find several users in the past were complaining about the page not mentioning violence, poverty and other major social problems in Brazil any Brazilian is well aware of. Any major city in Brazil has thousands of people living in \\'\\'\\'favelas\\'\\'\\', and for some reason a few users think that\\'s something that shouldn\\'t be mentioned in the article. I see only one motivation behind this - I think people want to hide dirt under the carpet.\\n\\nHey guys, I\\'m not one of these people that want to destroy the image of Brazil or anything like that. I just think information must be balanced, because that brings it closer to reality. We don\\'t need to talk \\'\\'only\\'\\' about issues in Brazil - but we do need to talk about issues in Brazil. Brazil isn\\'t Angola, but it\\'s not England or USA either. People here got offended because I was talking about Brazil being a \"developing\" nation... some of you are being too sensitive. Even Brazilian authorities talk about Brazil being a \"developing\" nation, including our President and our Legislative and Judiciary highest ranking members. Our Geography and History books talk about the \"developing\" nation we know as Brazil. So what\\'s happening here? Sincerely, I think some people(wether they are Brazilian or foreigners that like Brazil) are almost obsessed with the so-called touristic version of Brazil. I can undertand patriotism etc, but I\\'ve seen that harming the article ever since I started reading it almost two years ago. No wonder many good editors were slowly driven away. Some of you hold on to things in Wikipedia as if they were the most important thing of your lives or something. Guys, editing Wikipedia is only a way for us to spend our free time.\\n\\nI see [[User talk:Carlosguitar|Carlosguitar]] constantly saying I added information without references, when each bit of information I added was based on sources such as BBC World, Amnesty International and studies carried out by Fundação Getúlio Vargas. I didn\\'t invent expressions such as \"war zone\" - they came directly from the sources I mentioned. I think it\\'s quite clear I\\'m not wrong in this case.\\n\\nIf you guys could take some time to review this posture, maybe we can get back on track with [[Brazil]]. I no longer have much time to edit Wikipedia, I\\'m mainly only a reader now. Albeit I know this may make some people happy - lol - until I have time to come back as an editor, I will keep to myself knowing I made good contributions to Wikipedia and helped with several improvements.\\n\\nI\\'ve given up on this article since the sport section picture fight last year, when I noticed how people easily make things personal and are unwilling to let go of their own opinions even on the smallest little things such as a picture. I prefer to work on pages with few editors, where users don\\'t stab each other over each suggestion someone makes.\\n\\nGood luck to you guys.

This would reduce the overall size of the Brazil article and move the controversy about the details of \"social issues\" to a separate area so that the overall article remains more encyclopedic.\\n::::::: \"Social issues\" are part of a country, after all, but a single WP article does not need to go into detail on every aspect of a country.

By the way, my \\'\\'compromise\\'\\' that you have not seen, almost not reduced this article size, since I balanced the information. I do not see any problem with synthesis of material or NPOV on the current revision of article, Mhsb also agrees with the current revision so we have a consensus, since you, Sparks, Dúnadan and Opinoso do not explained how we resolve the problems with this section. I am sorry if you like this section and do not see problems, but we are fixing the problems now which were not fixed many time ago when Sparks unilaterally add a list of problems with [[WP:OR|original research]] and removed the neutrality of this. I will find disruptive, if anyone restore this section and ignore the discussion above which raises so many problems, especially the problems raised by Mhsb when he was discussing with Sparks and my compromise with Mhsb to fix the lack of neutrality, original research and other problems on this section. But what I have seen is you do not see problems with the current revision only with article size.

At this moment, there is no consensus that this article should have a Social issues section. Second, a section that only describe problems is totally unbalanced and has no place, whatsoever, in any article (unless it\\'s an article about the problem itself like [[Social issues in Brazil]]).--[[User:ClaudioMB|ClaudioMB]] ([[User talk:ClaudioMB|talk]]) 20:34, 13 May 2008 (UTC)\\n\\n::Claudio, just clarifying, you do not need consensus to remove unsourced, poorly sourced, or questionable material from [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons]].

I believe we are all acting in good faith here.  But while you did not *say* you are the final authority, I believe people could interpret it that way when you say things like \"There will not be a such-and-such section because this other page says so\".  It sounds as if you have already made the decision and that there will be no discussion.  I should also point out that I am *not* saying that there should or should not be a \"Social Issues\" section.  I am just pointing out that it is something that was still being talked about, and that the people with different opinions had not yet come together and agreed on a solution they would all follow.  *THAT* is the definition of \"consensus\".  If there is not yet an agreement on a controversial change, then there is *not* consensus.  Note that people do not need to agree with the end decision, but they do need to agree to follow it even if they disagree with parts of it.  That is consensus.\\n\\n:::You should know that I am leaning to agree with you on the \"Social Issues\" section, but I just want to see a decision that everyone will accept (not necessarily agree with) before someone says \"it is a consensus\" or \"this is how the article will be, and anyone who changes it will be considered disruptive.\"\\n\\n:::If I am misunderstanding any point, please inform me, as we are all here to work together, not to fight.

Many people have debated the contents of this section in the past, many defending it whilst others disputed it. The debate has always been a valid one, but a consensus was never reached. Now [[User talk:Carlosguitar|Carlosguitar]] is trying to artificially declare there is a “consensus” when it’s crystal clear there isn’t one. Several editors have defended the inclusion of the “social issues section”, and it has been a part of this article for many years. It has also always been under intense discussions. That means there’s no consensus. Actually, [[WP:Consensus]] does not clearly define what a “consensus” is, so it looks like [[User talk:Carlosguitar|Carlosguitar]] is exploring this small loophole in the rules to pass his own idea of a so-called \"consensus\" when we’re very far from one in [[Brazil]]. \\'\\'\\'How can we talk about a consensus when there are at least 3 users defending the inclusion of the “social issues” subsection in the current discussion\\'\\'\\' (myself, [[User:Opinoso|Opinoso]] and [[User:Dúnadan|<font color=\"blue\">the</font> <font color=\"#339900\">D</font><font color=\"blue\">únadan</font>]]) not to mention many others in past discussions?

In other words, if only a very small percentage of the entire country speaks it, then it would not warrant an entire paragraph but a brief mention. Spanish is probably a different situation in the United States, as it is spoken by a large minority due to a constant influx of immigration from Spanish-speaking countries as well as parts of the U.S. formerly being under Spanish/Mexican control. With the exception of Puerto Rico (with U.S. commonwealth status), Spanish is not official in any state, but the law does give allowance for it\\'s use in both New Mexico and California (I think).[[User:Kman543210|Kman543210]] ([[User talk:Kman543210|talk]]) 04:33, 14 July 2008 (UTC)\\n\\n:::::Thanks for the comments guys :) I will put up a sentence about [[Nheengatu]] in the Demographics > Language section, feel free to correct it if I made any mistakes alright.
