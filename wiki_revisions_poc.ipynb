This family is part of the [[bird]] order [[Procellariiformes]] (or tubenoses), which also includes the [[albatross]]es, the [[storm-petrel]]s, and the [[diving petrel]]s. \\n\\nThe procellariids are the most numerous family of tubenoses, and the most diverse. They range in size from the [[giant petrel]]s, which are almost as large as the albatrosses, to the prions, which are as small as the larger storm-petrels. They feed on [[fish]], [[squid]] and [[crustacea]], with many also taking [[Discards|fisheries discards]] and [[carrion]]. All species are accomplished long-distance foragers, and many undertake long [[equator|trans-equatorial]] [[bird migration|migrations]]. They are [[seabird colony|colonial breeders]], exhibiting long-term [[Monogamy|mate fidelity]] and [[philopatry|site philopatry]]. In all species, each pair lays a single [[egg (biology)|egg]] per breeding season. Their incubation times and chick-rearing periods are exceptionally long compared to other birds. \\n\\nMany procellariids have breeding populations of over several million pairs; others number fewer than 200 birds. Humans have traditionally exploited several species of [[fulmar]] and shearwater (known as [[muttonbird]]s) for food, fuel, and bait, a practice that continues in a controlled fashion today. Several species are threatened by [[introduced species]] attacking adults and chicks in breeding colonies and by [[long-line fishing|long-line fisheries]].\\n\\n==Procellariid biology==\\n===Taxonomy and evolution===\\nAccording to the famous [[DNA hybridization]] study into [[bird|avian]] [[phylogenetic relationship]]s by [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy|Sibley and Ahlquist]], the split of the [[Procellariiformes]] into the four families occurred around 30 million years ago; a [[fossil]] bone often attributed to the order, described as the genus \\'\\'[[Tytthostonyx]]\\'\\', has been found in rocks dating around the [[Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event|Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary]] (70-60 [[mya (unit)|mya]]), but the remains are too incomplete for placement within the Procellariiformes to be certain.<ref>Dyke, G. & Van Tuinen, M., (2004) \"The evolutionary radiation of modern birds (Neornithes): reconciling molecules, morphology, and the fossil record\" \\'\\'Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society\\'\\', \\'\\'\\'141\\'\\'\\'(2): 153-177[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1111/j.1096-3642.2004.00118.x/abs/]</ref>\\nThe molecular evidence suggests that the storm-petrels were the first to diverge from the ancestral stock, and the albatrosses next, with the procellariids and diving petrels splitting most recently. Many taxonomists used to retain the [[diving petrel]]s in this family also, but today their distinctiveness is considered well supported.\\n\\nHowever, modern procellariid genera began to appear possibly just as early as the proposed splitting of the family, with a [[Rupelian]] (Early  [[Oligocene]]) fossil from [[Belgium]] tentatively attributed to the shearwater genus \\'\\'Puffinus\\'\\',<ref>\\'\\'Puffinus raemdonkii\\'\\' (see \\'\\'[[Puffinus]]\\'\\').

The Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, PA, and The American Ornithologists’ Union, Washington, D.C.</ref>\\nand most modern genera were established by the [[Miocene]]. Thus, a basal radiation of the Procellariiformes in the [[Eocene]] at least (as with many modern orders of birds) seems likely, especially given that significant anomalies in molecular evolution rates and patterns have been discovered in the entire family<ref name = \"Rheindt\">  Rheindt, F.

The two species in the genus \\'\\'Bulweria\\'\\' have long been considered to be gadfly petrels along with the 37 \\'\\'Pterodroma\\'\\' petrels, but newer research questions this.]] The procellariid family is usually broken up into four fairly distinct groups; the [[fulmarine petrel]]s, the [[gadfly petrel]]s, the [[prion (bird)|prions]], and the [[shearwater]]s.\\n\\n* The fulmarine petrels include the largest procellariids, the [[giant petrel]]s, as well as the two [[fulmar]] species, the [[Snow Petrel]], the [[Antarctic Petrel]], and the [[Cape Petrel]]. The fulmarine petrels are a diverse group with differing habits and appearances, but are linked [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] by their [[skull]] features, particularly the long prominent nasal tubes. \\n\\n* The gadfly petrels, so named due to their [[helter-skelter]] flight, are the 37 species in the [[genus]] \\'\\'Pterodroma\\'\\' and have traditionally included the two species in the genus \\'\\'[[Bulweria]]\\'\\'. The species vary from small to medium sizes (26–46&nbsp;cm; 10.2–18.1&nbsp;in), and are long winged with short hooked bills. The genus \\'\\'Pterodroma\\'\\' is now split into four sub genera,<ref> Imber, M.J., (1985) \"Origins, phylogeny and taxonomy of the gadfly petrels \\'\\'Pterodroma spp\\'\\'.\" \\'\\'Ibis\\'\\' 127: 197–229</ref> and some species have been split out of the genus (see below).\\n\\n* The prions comprise six species of true prion in the genus \\'\\'[[Pachyptila]]\\'\\' and the closely related [[Blue Petrel]]. Often known in the past as whalebirds, three species have large bills filled with [[Lamellae (zoology)|lamellae]] that they use to filter [[plankton]] somewhat as [[baleen whale]]s do, though the old name derives from their association with whales, not their bills (though \"prions\" does, deriving from [[Ancient Greek]] for \"[[saw]]\"). They are small procellariids (25–30&nbsp;cm; 10–12&nbsp;in) with grey, patterned plumage, all inhabiting the [[Southern Ocean]]. \\n\\n* The shearwaters are adapted for diving after prey instead of foraging on the ocean\\'s surface; one species has been recorded diving as deep as 70 metres (230&nbsp;ft). The shearwaters are also well known for the long trans-equatorial migrations undertaken by many species. The shearwaters include the 20 or so species of the genus \\'\\'[[Puffinus]]\\'\\', as well as the five large \\'\\'[[Procellaria]]\\'\\' species and the three \\'\\'[[Calonectris]]\\'\\' species. While all these three genera are known collectively as shearwaters, the \\'\\'Procellaria\\'\\' are called petrels in their common names. A recent study splits the shearwater genus \\'\\'Puffinus\\'\\' into two separate clades or subgroups, Puffinus and Neonectris. Puffinus are the \\'smaller\\' \\'\\'Puffinus\\'\\' shearwaters ([[Manx Shearwater|Manx]], [[Little Shearwater|Little]] and [[Audubon\\'s Shearwater]]s, for example), and the Neonectris are the \\'larger\\' \\'\\'Puffinus\\'\\' shearwaters ([[Sooty Shearwater]]s, for example); in 2004 it was proposed that Neonectris be split into its own genus, \\'\\'Ardenna\\'\\'.<ref name = \"wink\"> Penhallurick, J. and Wink, M.

The largest, the [[giant petrel]]s, are almost as large as [[albatross]]es; the smallest, such as the [[prion (bird)|prion]]s and some of the [[shearwater]]s, are slightly bigger than the [[diving petrel]]s. There are no obvious differences between the sexes, although females tend to be slighter.<ref name = \"Brooke\">Brooke, M.

The [[plumage]] of the procellariids is usually dull, with greys, blues, blacks and browns being the usual colours, although some species have striking patterns (such as the [[Cape Petrel]]).\\n\\n[[Image:Christmas shearwater takeoff.JPG|thumb|250px|left|The high wing loading of procellariids requires a high wing speed to remain airborne, so in order to take off this [[Christmas Shearwater]] \\'\\'Puffinus nativitatis\\'\\' must face into a strong wind. In calm conditions it must run in order to obtain a high wind speed.]] \\nThe technique of [[bird flight|flight]] among procellariids depends on foraging methods. Compared to an average bird, all procellariids have a high [[aspect ratio]] (meaning their wings are long and narrow) and a heavy [[wing loading]]. Therefore they must maintain a high speed in order to remain in the air. Most procellariids use two techniques to do this, namely, [[dynamic soaring]] and [[slope soaring]].<ref name =\"pen\">Pennycuick, C. J. (1982). \"The flight of petrels and albatrosses (Procellariiformes), observed in South Georgia and its vicinity\". \\'\\'Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'300\\'\\'\\': 75–106.</ref> Dynamic soaring involves gliding across wave fronts, thus taking advantage of the vertical [[wind gradient]] and minimising the effort required to stay in the air. Slope soaring is more straightforward: the procellariid turns to the wind, gaining height, from where it can then glide back down to the sea. Most procellariids aid their flight by means of flap-glides, where bursts of flapping are followed by a period of gliding; the amount of flapping dependent on the strength of the wind and the choppiness of the water.<ref name =\"war\">Warham, J. (1996). \\'\\'The Behaviour, Population, Biology and Physiology of the Petrels\\'\\'. London: Academic Press, ISBN 0-12-735415-8</ref> Shearwaters and other larger petrels, which have lower aspect ratio, must make more use of flapping to remain airborne than gadfly petrels. Because of the high speeds required for flight, procellariids need to either run or face into a strong wind in order to take off. \\n\\n[[Image:Giant petrel - Macronectes giganteus.jpg|thumb|250px|The flight of giant petrels is aided by a shoulder-lock that holds their wing out without effort.]]\\nThe giant petrels share with the albatrosses an adaptation known as a shoulder-lock: a sheet of [[tendon]] which locks the wing when fully extended, allowing the wing to be kept up and out without any muscle effort.  Gadfly petrels often feed on the wing, snapping prey without landing on the water. The flight of the smaller prions is similar to that of the [[storm-petrel]]s, being highly erratic and involving weaving and even looping the loop. The wings of all species are long and stiff. In some species of shearwater the wings are also used to power the birds underwater while diving for prey. Their heavier wing loadings, in comparison with surface-feeding procellariids, allow these shearwaters to achieve considerable depths (below 70&nbsp;m or 230&nbsp;ft in the case of the [[Short-tailed Shearwater]]).<ref>Weimerskirch, H., Cherel, Y., (1998) Feeding ecology of short-tailed shearwaters: breeding in Tasmania and foraging in the Antarctic? \\'\\'Marine Ecology Progress Series\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'167\\'\\'\\': 261–274</ref>\\n\\nProcellariids generally have weak legs, and many species move around on land by resting on the breast and pushing themselves forward, often with the help of their wings.<ref name =\"war\"/> The exception to this is the two species of giant petrel, which like the albatrosses, have strong legs used to feed on land (see below).

With the exception of the [[giant petrel]]s, all procellariids are exclusively [[ocean|marine]], and the diet of all species is dominated by either [[fish]], [[squid]], [[crustacean]]s and [[carrion]], or some combination thereof.\\n\\nThe majority of species are surface feeders, obtaining food that has been pushed to the surface by other predators or currents, or have floated in death. Among the surface feeders some, principally the [[gadfly petrel]]s, can obtain food by dipping from flight, while most of the rest feed while sitting on the water. These surface feeders are dependent on their prey being close to the surface, and for this reason procellariids are often found in association with other predators or oceanic convergences. Studies have shown strong associations between many different kinds of [[seabird]]s, including [[Wedge-tailed Shearwater]]s, and [[dolphin]]s and [[tuna]], which push shoaling fish up towards the surface.<ref name = \"AU\">Au, D.W.K. & Pitman, R.L.

These colonies vary in size from over a million birds to just a few pairs, and can be densely concentrated or widely spaced. At one extreme the [[Greater Shearwater]] nests in concentrations of 1 pair per square metre in three colonies of more than 1 million pairs,<ref name = \"Brooke\"/> whereas the giant petrels nest in clumped but widely spaced territories that barely qualify as colonial. Colonies are usually located near the coast, but some species nest far inland and even at high altitudes (such as the [[Barau\\'s Petrel]]). \\n\\nMost [[seabird]]s are colonial, and the reasons for colonial behaviour are assumed to be similar, if incompletely understood by scientists. Procellariids for the most part have weak legs and are unable to easily take off, making them highly vulnerable to [[mammal]]ian predators. Most procellariid colonies are located on islands that have historically been free of mammals; for this reason some species cannot help but be colonial as they are limited to a few locations to breed. Even species that breed on continental [[Antarctica]], such as the [[Antarctic Petrel]], are forced by habitat preference (snow-free north-facing rock) to breed in just a few locations.\\n\\n[[Image:Dark rumped petrel.jpeg|thumb|210px|The [[Hawaiian Petrel]] \\'\\'Pterodroma sandwichensis\\'\\' nests at high altitudes in burrows that are over 1 m deep.]]\\nMost procellariids\\' nests are in burrows or on the surface on open ground, with a smaller number nesting under the cover of vegetation (such as in a forest). All the fulmarine petrels bar the [[Snow Petrel]] nest in the open, the Snow Petrel instead nesting inside natural crevices. Of the rest of the procellariids the majority nest in burrows or crevices, with a few tropical species nesting in the open. There are several reasons for these differences. The fulmarine petrels are probably precluded from burrowing by their large size (the crevice-nesting Snow Petrel is the smallest fulmarine petrel) and the high latitudes they breed in, where frozen ground is difficult to burrow into. The smaller size of the other species, and their lack of agility on land, mean that even on islands free from mammal predators they are still vulnerable to [[skua]]s,<ref>Reinhard, K., Hahn, S., Peter, H.-U., Wemhoff, H., (2000).\"A review of the diets of Southern Hemisphere skuas.\" \\'\\'Marine Ornithology\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'28\\'\\'\\': 7–19.</ref> [[gull]]s and other avian predators, something the aggressive [[stomach oil|oil]]-spitting [[fulmar]]s are not. The chicks of all species are vulnerable to predation, but the chicks of fulmarine petrels can defend themselves in a similar fashion to their parents. In the higher latitudes there are thermal advantages to burrow nesting, as the temperature is more stable than on the surface, and there is no [[wind-chill]] to contend with. The absence of skuas, gulls and other predatory birds on [[tropical]] islands is why some [[shearwater]]s and two species of [[gadfly petrel]] can nest in the open. This has the advantages of reducing competition with burrow nesters from other species and allowing open-ground nesters to nest on [[coral]]line islets without soil for burrowing. Procellariids that burrow in order to avoid predation almost always attend their colonies [[nocturnal animal|nocturnally]] in order to reduce predation as well.<ref>Keitt, B.S., Tershy, B.R. & Croll, D.A (2004). \"Nocturnal behavior reduces predation pressure on Black-vented Shearwaters \\'\\'Puffinus opisthomelas\\'\\'\" \\'\\'Marine Ornithology\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'32\\'\\'\\' (3): 173-178.[http://www.marineornithology.org/PDF/32_2/32_2_173-178.pdf]</ref> Of the ground-nesting species the majority attend their colonies during the day, the exception being the [[Herald Petrel]], which is thought to be vulnerable to the diurnal [[White-bellied Sea Eagle]].\\n\\n[[Image:Christmas shearwater.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Christmas Shearwater]]s \\'\\'Puffinus nativitatis\\'\\' are one of the surface-breeding procellariids. Here a pair engages in some mutual preening.]]\\nProcellariids display high levels of [[philopatry]], exhibiting both natal philopatry and site fidelity. Natal philopatry, the tendency of a bird to breed close to where it hatched, is strong amongst all the Procellariiformes. The evidence for natal philopatry comes from several sources, not the least of which is the existence of several procellariid species that are endemic to a single island.<ref name = \"Brooke\"/> The study of [[mitochondrial DNA]] also provides evidence of restricted [[gene flow]] between different colonies, and has been used to show philopatry in [[Fairy Prion]]s.<ref>Ovenden, J.R., Wust-Saucy, A., Bywater, R., Brothers, N., White, R.W.G.

[http://scholar.google.com/url?sa=U&q=http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v108n03/p0688-p0694.pdf]</ref> [[Bird ringing]] also provides compelling evidence of philopatry; a study of [[Cory\\'s Shearwater]]s nesting near [[Corsica]] found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony actually bred in the burrow they were raised in.<ref>Rabouam, C., Thibault, J.-C., Bretagnolle, V., (1998) \"Natal Philopatry and Close Inbreeding in Cory\\'s Shearwater (\\'\\'Calonectris diomedea\\'\\')\" \\'\\'Auk\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'115\\'\\'\\'(2): 483–486 [http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v115n02/p0483-p0486.pdf]</ref> This tendency towards philopatry is stronger in some species than others, and several species readily prospect potential new colony sites and colonise them. It is hypothesised that there is a cost to dispersing to a new site, the chance of not finding a mate of the same species, that selects against it for rarer species, whereas there is probably an advantage to dispersal for species which have colony sites that change dramatically during periods of [[Glacial motion|glacial advance or retreat]]. There are also differences in the tendency to disperse based on sex, with females being more likely to breed away from the natal site.<ref name = \"Brooke\"/>\\n\\n====Mate and site fidelity====\\nProcellariids, as well as having strong natal philopatry, exhibit strong site fidelity, returning to the same nesting site, burrow or territory in sequential years. The figure varies for different species but is high for most species, an estimated 91% for [[Bulwer\\'s Petrel]]s.<ref>Mouguin, J-L., (1996) \"Faithfulness to mate and nest site of Bulwer\\'s Petrel, \\'\\'Bulweria bulweria\\'\\' at Selvagem Grande\" \\'\\'Marine Ornithology\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'24\\'\\'\\': 15–18.

Barcelona:Lynx Edicions, ISBN 84-87334-10-5</ref> Like the [[albatross]]es the procellariids take several years to reach sexual maturity, though due to the greater variety of sizes and lifestyles, the age of first breeding stretches from just three years in the smaller species to 12 years in the larger ones. \\n\\n[[Image:Fulmarus glacialis 1 8.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Northern Fulmar]] \\'\\'Fulmarus glacialis\\'\\' pair perform a cackling duet.]] \\nThe procellariids lack the elaborate breeding dances of the albatrosses, in no small part due to the tendency of most of them to attend colonies at night and breed in burrows, where visual displays are useless. The [[fulmarine petrel]]s, which nest on the surface and attend their colonies diurnally, do use a repertoire of stereotyped [[animal behaviour|behaviours]] such as cackling, preening, head waving and nibbling, but for most species courtship interactions are limited to some billing (rubbing the two bills together) in the burrow and the vocalisations made by all species. The calls serve a number of functions: they are used territorially to protect burrows or territories and to call for mates. Each call type is unique to a particular species and indeed it is possible for procellariids to identify the sex of the bird calling as well. It may also be possible to assess the quality of potential mates; a study of [[Blue Petrel]]s found a link between the [[rhythm]] and duration of calls and the body mass of the bird.<ref> Genevois, F; Bretagnolle, V (1994) \"Male Blue Petrels reveal their body mass when calling\"  \\'\\'Ethology Ecology & Evolution\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'6\\'\\'\\'(3): 377–383.</ref> The ability of an individual to recognise its mate has also been demonstrated in several species.\\n\\n====Breeding season====\\nLike most seabirds, the majority of procellariids breed once a year. There are exceptions; many individuals of the larger species, such as the [[White-headed Petrel]], will skip a breeding season after successfully [[fledge|fledging]] a chick, and some of the smaller species, such as the [[Christmas Shearwater]]s, breed on a nine-month schedule. Amongst those that breed annually, there is considerable variation as to the timing; some species breed in a fixed season whilst others breed all year round.  [[Climate]] and the availability of food resources are important influences on the timing of procellariid breeding; species that breed at higher [[latitude]]s always breed in the summer as conditions are too harsh in the winter. At lower latitudes many, but not all, species breed continuously. Some species breed seasonally, to avoid competition with other species for burrows, to avoid predation or to take advantage of seasonally abundant food. Others, such as the [[tropical]] [[Wedge-tailed Shearwater]], breed seasonally for reasons unknown. Among the species that exhibit seasonal breeding there can be high levels of synchronization, both of time of arrival at the colony and of lay date.<ref name = \"Brooke\"/>\\n\\nProcellariids begin to attend their nesting colony around one month prior to laying. Males will arrive first and attend the colony more frequently than females, partly in order to protect a site or burrow from potential competitors. Prior to laying there is a period known as the pre-laying exodus in which both the male and female are away from the colony, building up reserves in order to lay and undertake the first incubation stint respectively. This pre-laying exodus can vary in length from 9 days (as in the [[Cape Petrel]])<ref> Weidinger, K (1996) \"Patterns of colony attendance in the Cape Petrel \\'\\'Daption capense\\'\\' at Nelson Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica\"  \\'\\'Ibis\\'\\'.\\'\\'\\'138\\'\\'\\'(2): 243–249.</ref> to around 50 days in [[Atlantic Petrel]]s.<ref>Cuthbert, R., (2004) \"Breeding biology of the Atlantic Petrel, \\'\\'Pterodroma incerta\\'\\', and a population estimate of this and other burrowing petrels on Gough Island, South Atlantic Ocean\" \\'\\'Emu\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'104\\'\\'\\'(3): 221–228 </ref> All procellariids lay one [[egg (biology)|egg]] per pair per breeding season, in common with the rest of the Procellariiformes. The egg is large compared to that of other birds, weighing 6–24% of the female\\'s weight. Immediately after laying the female goes back to sea to feed while the male takes over incubation. Incubation duties are shared by both sexes in shifts that vary in length between species, individuals and even the stage of incubation. The longest recorded shift was 29 days by a [[Murphy\\'s Petrel]] from [[Henderson Island]]; the typical length of a [[gadfly petrel]] stint is between 13 and 19 days. [[Fulmarine petrel]]s, [[shearwater]]s and [[prion (bird)|prions]] tend to have shorter stints, averaging between 3 to 13 days. Incubation takes a long time, from 40 days for the smaller species (such as prions) to around 55 days for the larger species. The incubation period is longer if eggs are abandoned temporarily; procellariid eggs are resistant to chilling and can still hatch after being left unattended for a few days. \\n[[Image:Pterodroma hypoleuca.jpg|thumb|250px|The chick of a [[Bonin Petrel]] \\'\\'Pterodroma hypoleuca\\'\\' takes almost three months to fledge. This chick has most of its adult plumage but still retains a considerable amount of down.]]\\nAfter hatching the chick is brooded by a parent until it is large enough to [[thermoregulation|thermoregulate]] efficiently, and in some cases defend itself from predation. This guard stage lasts a short while for burrow-nesting species (2–3 days) but longer for surface nesting [[fulmar]]s (around 16–20 days) and [[giant petrel]]s (20–30 days). After the guard stage both parents feed the chick. In many species the parent\\'s foraging strategy alternates between short trips lasting 1–3 days and longer trips of 5 days.<ref>Weimerskirch, H., Chastel, O., Ackermann, L., Chaurand, T., Cuenot-Chaillet, F., Hindermeyer, X. & Judas, J., (1994) \"Alternate long and short foraging trips in pelagic seabird parents\" \\'\\'Animal Behaviour\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'47\\'\\'\\': 472–476</ref> The shorter trips, which are taken over the continental shelf, benefit the chick with faster growth, but longer trips to more productive [[pelagic zone|pelagic]] feeding grounds are needed for the parents to maintain their own body condition. The meals are composed of both prey items and [[stomach oil]], an [[food energy|energy]]-rich food that is lighter to carry than undigested prey items.<ref>Warham, J. (1976) \"The incidence, function and ecological significance of petrel stomach oils.\" \\'\\'Proceedings of the New Zealand Ecological Society\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'24\\'\\'\\': 84–93 [http://www.nzes.org.nz/nzje/free_issues/ProNZES24_84.pdf]</ref> This oil is created in a stomach organ known as a proventriculus from digested prey items, and gives procellariids and other Procellariifromes their distinctive musty smell. Chick development is quite slow for [[bird]]s, with [[fledge|fledging]] taking place at around 2 months after hatching for the smaller species and 4 months for the largest species. The chicks of some species are abandoned by the parents; parents of other species continue to bring food to the nesting site after the chick has left. All procellariid chicks fledge by themselves, and there is no further parental care after fledging.\\n\\n==Procellariids and humans==\\n===Exploitation of procellariids===\\n[[Image:Puffinus griseus.png|thumb|left|[[Sooty Shearwater]]s \\'\\'Puffinus griseus\\'\\' are still harvested in New Zealand using traditional techniques]]\\nProcellariids have been a seasonally abundant source of food for people wherever people have been able to reach their colonies. Early records of human exploitation of shearwaters (along with [[albatross]]es and [[cormorant]]s) come from the remains of [[hunter-gatherer]] [[midden]]s in southern [[Chile]], where [[Sooty Shearwater]]s were taken 5000 years ago.<ref>Simeone, A. & Navarro, X.

The hunting pressure on the [[Bermuda Petrel]], or Cahow, was so intense that the species nearly went extinct and did go missing for 300 years. The name of one species, the [[Providence Petrel]], is derived from its (seemingly) miraculous arrival on [[Norfolk Island]], where it provided a windfall for starving European settlers;<ref name = \"Anderson\">Anderson, A.

More sustainable shearwater harvesting industries developed in [[Tasmania]] and [[New Zealand]], where the practice of harvesting what are known as [[muttonbird]]s continues today.\\n\\n===Threats and conservation===\\nWhilst some species of procellariid have populations that number in the millions, many species are much less common and several are threatened with [[extinction]]. Human activities have caused dramatic declines in the numbers of some species, particularly species that were originally restricted to one island. According to the [[IUCN]] 36 species are listed as vulnerable or worse, with ten critically endangered.<ref>IUCN, 2004.

Procellariids overwhelmingly breed on islands away from land predators such as mammals, and for the most part have lost the defensive adaptations needed to deal with them (with the exception of the [[stomach oil|oil]]-spitting [[fulmarine petrel]]s). The introduction of mammal predators such as [[feral cat]]s, [[rat]]s, [[mongoose]]s and even [[mice]] can have disastrous results for [[island tameness|ecologically naïve]] [[seabird]]s.<ref>Moors, P.J. & Atkinson, I.A.E.

Burrowing species that leave their young unattended at a very early stage are particularly vulnerable to attack. Studies on [[Grey-faced Petrel]]s breeding on New Zealand\\'s [[Whale Island, New Zealand|Whale Island]] (Moutohora) have shown that a population under heavy pressure from [[Norway Rat]]s will produce virtually no young during a breeding season, whereas if the rats are controlled (through the use of poison), breeding success is much higher.<ref name =\"imber2000\">Imber, M., Harrison, M. & Harrsion, J. (2000) \"Interactions between petrels, rats and rabbits on Whale Island and effects of rat and rabbit eradication.\" \\'\\'New Zealand Journal of Ecology\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'24\\'\\'\\'(2): 153–160</ref> That study also highlighted the role that non-predatory introduced species can play in harming seabirds; introduced [[rabbit]]s on the island caused little damage to the petrels, other than damaging their burrows, but they also acted as a food source for the rats during the non-breeding season, which allowed rat numbers to be higher than they otherwise would be, resulting in more predators for the petrels to contend with. Interactions with introduced species can be quite complex. [[Gould’s Petrel]]s breed only on two islands, Cabbage Tree Island and Boondelbah Island off [[New South Wales]]. Introduced rabbits destroyed the forest understory on Cabbage Tree Island; this both increased the vulnerability of the petrels to natural predators and left them vulnerable to the sticky fruits of the birdlime tree (\\'\\'[[Pisonia]] umbellifera\\'\\'), a native plant. In the natural state these fruits lodge in the understory of the forest, but with the understory removed the fruits fall to the ground where the petrels move about, sticking to their feathers and making flight impossible.<ref name =\"car\">Carlile, N., Proiddel, D., Zino, F., Natividad, C. & Wingate, D.B.

These species readily take offal from fishing boats and will also steal bait from the long lines as they are being set, risking becoming snared on the hooks and drowning.<ref>Nel, D., Ryan, P. & Watkins, B.

Studies of gill-net fisheries show that shearwaters (Sooty and Short-tailed) compose 60% of the seabirds killed by gill-nets in Japanese waters and 40% in Monterey Bay, California in the 1980s,<ref>King, W.B. (1984) \"Incidental mortality of seabirds in gillnets in the North Pacific\" in \\'\\'Status and Conservation of the World’s Seabirds\\'\\' (Croxall, J.P, Evans, P.G.H. & Schreiber, R.W., \\'\\'eds\\'\\')  ICBP technical publication ISBN 0-946888-03-5, 667–690</ref> with the total number of shearwaters killed in Japan being between 65,000 and 125,000 per annum over the same study period (1978–1981).<ref>Ogi, H., (1984)\\'\\'Seabird mortality incidental to the Japanese salmon gill-net fishery” in \\'\\'Status and Conservation of the World’s Seabirds\\'\\' (Croxall, J.P, Evans, P.G.H. & Schreiber, R.W., \\'\\'eds\\'\\')  ICBP technical publication ISBN 0-946888-03-5, 667–690</ref>\\n\\nProcellariids are vulnerable to other threats as well. Ingestion of plastic [[flotsam]] is a problem for the family as it is for many other seabirds.<ref>Pierce, K., Harris, R., Larned, L., Pokras, M., (2004) \"Obstruction and starvation associated with plastic ingestion in a Northern Gannet \\'\\'Morus bassanus\\'\\' and a Greater Shearwater \\'\\'Puffinus gravis\\'\\'\" \\'\\'Marine Ornithology\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'32\\'\\'\\': 187–189 [http://www.marineornithology.org/PDF/32_2/32_2_187-189.pdf]</ref> Once swallowed, this plastic can cause a general decline in the fitness of the bird, or in some cases lodge in the gut and cause a blockage, leading to death by starvation. Procellariids are also vulnerable to general marine pollution, as well as oil spills. Some species, such as the [[Barau\\'s Petrel]] and the [[Newell\\'s Shearwater]], which nest high up on large developed islands are victims of light pollution. Chicks that are [[fledge|fledging]] are attracted to streetlights and are unable to reach the sea. An estimated 20–40% of fledging Barau\\'s Petrels are attracted to the streetlights on [[Réunion]].<ref>Le Correa, M., Ollivier, A., Ribesc S., Jouventin, P., (2002) \"[http://web.archive.org/web/20061116215442/http://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/ecomp/PDF+papers/LeCorre+2002.pdf Light-induced mortality of petrels: a 4-year study from Réunion Island (Indian Ocean)]\" \\'\\'Biological Conservation\\'\\' \\'\\'\\'105\\'\\'\\': 93–102</ref>\\n\\nConservationists are working with governments and fisheries in order to prevent further declines and increase populations of endangered procellariids. Progress has been made in protecting many colonies where most species are most vulnerable. The developing field of [[island restoration]], where introduced species are removed and native species and habitats restored, has been used in several procellariid recovery programmes.<ref name =\"car\"/> Invasive species such as rats, feral cats and pigs have been either removed or controlled in many remote islands in the tropical Pacific (such as the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]]), around New Zealand (where island restoration was developed), and in the south [[Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean]]s. The Grey-faced Petrels of Whale Island (mentioned above) have been achieving much higher fledging successes after the introduced Norway Rats were finally completely removed.<ref name =\"imber2000\"/> At sea, procellariids threatened by long-line fisheries can be protected using techniques such as setting long-line bait at night, dying the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, increasing the amount of weight on lines and using bird scarers can all reduce the seabird by-catch.<ref>Food and Agriculture Organisation (1999) \"The incidental catch of seabirds by longline fisheries: worldwide review and technical guidelines for mitigation. FAO Fisheries Circular No.937. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome. [http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=/DOCREP/005/W9817E/W9817E00.HTM]</ref> A further step towards conservation has been the signing of the 2001 [[treaty]] the [[Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels]], which came into force in 2004 and has been ratified by eight countries, [[Australia]], [[Ecuador]], [[New Zealand]], [[Spain]], [[South Africa]], [[France]], [[Peru]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. The treaty requires these countries to take specific actions to reduce by-catch and pollution and to remove introduced species from nesting islands.\\n\\n==References==\\n<!--This article uses the Cite.php citation mechanism.
